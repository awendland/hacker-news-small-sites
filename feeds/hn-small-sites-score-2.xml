              <p>Nevada has 86% of its votes reported and won’t announce additional results until later today. But it’s pretty easy to crunch the numbers because it has only 22 counties.</p>
<p>Nearly all of those counties are red except for Clark and Washoe, which are by far the largest in population. All you have to do is extrapolate the remaining votes, on a per county basis, to break the same way the existing votes have gone.</p>
<p>One pitfall here is timing bias, i.e., the later counted votes within a county may be distributed differently than those counted earlier. That’s quite possible if they are comprised of a differently distributed category (e.g. mail-in vs. in-person, early vs. later received absentee ballots, etc.).</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, “Remaining votes include mail ballots received on Election Day, those that will arrive over the next week and provisional ballots.". So they’ll likely skew a bit but it’s not obvious in which direction. And 86% is a pretty good sample size.</p>
<p>The calculation below does this simple per-county extrapolation. My projected shares of the total may be off a bit due to excluding the effect of the two other party candidates, but the relative difference should be the same: Biden will win Nevada by about 1%.</p>

            <p>Five years ago, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ui-movement" target="_blank">I launched a little side project called UI Movement</a> which was a newsletter that featured five design animations every week. It's since grown in scope and popularity until the newsletter had close to 30,000 subscribers and the site was getting ~350,000 page views per month.</p><p>The featured designs came from various external sources, but one was by far the most popular. It made sense because that source was super well known amongst designers and it’s where they go to share their work.</p><p>The legal team from that website sent me a cease and desist for UI Movement a couple of months ago. Even though the featured designs always included attribution and links back to the original, they were clearly not happy that UI Movement was featuring content from their site. The email was a bit of a shock, but deep down I knew it could happen at any moment. Running a “curation” type site like UI Movement with most of the content coming from one source was always a risk.</p><p>I thought about making minor changes and hoping it would be enough, but decided to take a different approach.</p><p>The truth is, UI Movement is no longer a big part of my business and it was more of a passion project/hobby that I was slowly losing interest in. I was getting tired of featuring over-the-top design animations that would never make it into production or would be quite annoying for users if they did. While I still see value in finding inspiration from unrealistic designs, I wasn’t enjoying the process of curating them anymore.</p><p>Instead of shutting UI Movement down or making a few small tweaks, I decided to start from scratch and make a UI design inspiration site I could get excited about.</p><p>The end result is that UI Movement became <a href="https://screenlane.com/" target="_blank">Screenlane</a>: A site that features web &amp; mobile screenshots from live products for UI design inspiration. No more unrealistic prototypes. Admittedly, not the most innovative idea, but I believe I can get Screenlane to the point where it's providing as much or more value than UI Movement.</p><p>Screenlane has been live for ~3 weeks and I thought it would be a good time to share some numbers. This was more than a redesign or a rebrand with a domain change. It's all new content, a new domain, brand, and website. I had no idea what to expect.</p><p>Here are the numbers so far:<br></p><h2>The newsletter</h2><p>When the announcement email was sent, the newsletter had 29,662 subscribers. It now has 29,250 subscribers (a decrease of 412).</p><p>The announcement email included a big “unsubscribe” button after an explanation of the change and why it happened.<br></p><p>Since then, a couple more weekly newsletters have been sent and they both briefly mentioned the change. I'm hoping the number of unsubscribes will level off over time. 128 people have subscribed since the change, which is promising.</p><h2>Website traffic</h2><p>Traffic has dropped from ~15,000 users &amp; ~82,000 page views per week to ~8,000 users and ~38,000 page views per week.</p><p><img src="https://rocketgems.com/media/django-summernote/2020-11-04/a00341d1-3aaf-45d0-9a8e-728d22043ed9.png"><br></p><p>Traffic from <b>uimovement.com</b> is redirected to <b>screenlane.com?ref=uimovement</b>, which helps me track the trend of how much of the traffic is still attempting to go to UI Movement. I also submitted a "change of address" notice to Google through the&nbsp;Search Console.&nbsp;</p><h2><span>Reactions from subscribers</span></h2><p>I rarely heard from UI Movement subscribers until this change. At least half a dozen people have been in touch to let me know how how sad they are that UI Movement is essentially dead and how much value they got from it. A few people also shared some words of encouragement about the direction I've taken with Screenlane. It was both surprising and awesome to hear from subscribers. Honestly, I didn't expect as many people to be disappointed by the demise of UI Movement. I now feel a bit more pressure to make Screenlane great.</p><p>Overall, the decrease in newsletter subscribers is reasonably small, the drop in traffic is substantial, and the overall response to Screenlane is positive. I'm fairly happy with how things are going &amp; it will be interesting to see if I can stop the downward trend and start growing the traffic &amp; newsletter again.</p><p>It's been quite fun to make such a drastic change without worrying too much about the outcome. This whole situation would have been much worse if UI Movement was a significant part of the business or still drove a lot of traffic to <a href="https://pageflows.com/" target="_blank">Page Flows</a>.</p>

<p>Re­li­gious con­ser­v­a­tives grasp at straws when try­ing to jus­tify their pro-life (an­ti-abor­tion) po­si­tion, usu­ally ap­peal­ing to ei­ther re­li­gious doc­trine or the idea that abor­tion is “killing a baby” and killing is wrong. The log­i­cal faults with these ar­gu­ments are ob­vi­ous, but I see the ar­gu­ments of re­li­gious in­di­vid­u­als who are hor­ri­fied with abor­tion as a des­per­ate at­tempt to jus­tify their cor­rect in­tu­ition — cor­rect, be­cause abor­tion is wrong. It is the killing of a de­fense­less crea­ture we ought to pro­tect. Even most pro-­choice peo­ple ad­mit abor­tion is a last re­sort and un­wanted preg­nan­cies should be avoid­ed. This con­ceeds the un­eth­i­cal na­ture of abor­tion, and sim­ply states it is over­come by other fac­tors. This means where you fall on the pro-­choice/pro-life de­bate is a sub­jec­tive ques­tion of how you bal­ance these fac­tors, not “an­ti-­science” as some claim. I ad­dress sev­eral of these fac­tors in this ar­ti­cle, and I also out­line sev­eral of­ten-ig­nored rea­sons why abor­tion is wrong, and they’re hope­fully more so­phis­ti­cated than the usual re­li­gious tripe you’ve heard be­fore. Note that these are all ar­gu­ments for why abor­tion is eth­i­cally wrong and should be avoid­ed, not an ar­gu­ment that we should make abor­tion il­le­gal, which is a bad idea and does­n’t even make abor­tion less com­mon, only more dan­ger­ous.</p>
<h3 id="common-pro-choice-arguments">Com­mon pro-­choice ar­gu­ments</h3>
<p>Many pro-­choice ar­gu­ments are flawed in that they can be ap­plied equally to jus­tify abor­tion and (post-birth) in­fan­ti­cide. An MIT pro-­choice stu­dent group made the ar­gu­ment that “un­wanted life can be worse than no life at al­l,” im­ply­ing the right of a child to a mother who wants them and who is pre­pared for moth­er­hood, fi­nan­cially and oth­er­wise. Lack of such prepa­ra­tion of the mother is ap­par­ently grounds for killing the fe­tus, be­cause death is bet­ter than a bad life. So why not kill a three­-­mon­th-old baby whose mother is poor, or does­n’t care for them much? Would it not, too, be a form of eu­thanasia? More self­ish are the ar­gu­ments for the wom­an’s right not to be a mother and in­stead to be able to have a ca­reer or what­ev­er, which could as eas­ily jus­tify in­fan­ti­cide. Don’t want to kill your chances at a ca­reer? Kill your baby in­stead!</p>
<p>The same MIT stu­dent group ar­gues: why should a woman have to “face all con­se­quences from some­thing she did not do alone”? An­other ar­gu­ment for the killing of a <span>fetus<span>or baby</span></span> based on in­con­ve­nience to the moth­er, but this time with a hint of the com­mon pro-­choice ac­cu­sa­tion of misog­y­ny: this is just men telling women what to do with their bod­ies, and if men could get preg­nant, then abor­tion would have been le­gal a long time ago. (N­ev­er­mind the fact that women have been able to vote since 1920 in the United States.) But this ar­gu­ment also falls with the com­par­i­son to in­fan­ti­cide. Men can’t get preg­nant, but they can have chil­dren, and many of them don’t want chil­dren. Many men would find it con­ve­nient to get rid of their chil­dren so they don’t have to pay child sup­port. So why is in­fan­ti­cide il­le­gal? Per­haps be­cause the de­sires of the par­ent are out­weighed by the rights of the child.</p>
<p>Any­one who has seen a new­born baby knows how un­de­vel­oped they are, and the dis­tinc­tion be­tween a baby <span>right before birth and right after<span>or right before ’viability’ and right after, if you prefer</span></span> is sim­i­lar to the dis­tinc­tion be­tween magma and lava — that is, it’s ba­si­cally the same thing but in a dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tion. This means nearly every pro-­choice ar­gu­ment can be ap­plied equally to jus­tify in­fan­ti­cide, ren­der­ing it use­less. The ex­cep­tion is the ar­gu­ment of the bod­ily au­ton­omy of the moth­er: the fe­tus has no right to the body of the moth­er. Ap­par­ently this bod­ily au­ton­omy of the mother ex­tends to the right to cut up the fe­tus and suck its body parts out with a hose, or the right to crush the skull of the fe­tus, or the right to poi­son the fe­tus to death — all com­mon meth­ods of abor­tion. If the fe­tus were sim­ply re­moved in a fash­ion sim­i­lar to birth, and al­lowed to die of nat­ural caus­es, this ar­gu­ment may ap­ply, but oth­er­wise a dou­ble stan­dard ex­ists be­tween the bod­ily au­ton­omy of the mother and the bod­ily au­ton­omy of the fe­tus. In any case, the ar­gu­ment for bod­ily au­ton­omy is weak: the fe­tus did­n’t ask to be cre­at­ed, and the mother cre­ated it any­way, so she should be re­spon­si­ble for it. The ten­ancy agree­ment of the fe­tus was made im­plic­itly on con­cep­tion.</p>
<h3 id="sympathy-arguments">Sym­pa­thy ar­gu­ments</h3>
<p>We don’t eat <span>dog or cat<span>or dogs or cats, if you prefer to avoid the mass nouns and see them as individuals</span></span> be­cause it would be ab­ho­rant to us to eat crea­tures which would re­mind us of crea­tures we love, even though, for ex­am­ple, pigs are at least as cog­ni­tively so­phis­ti­cat­ed. But pigs are gross and roll in the mud, so it’s okay to eat them. Eat­ing them won’t break any­one’s hearts un­less their hearts were al­ready bleed­ing. Sim­i­larly to our aver­sion to cati­cide and dogi­cide, we should avoid abor­tion be­cause feti­cide re­minds us of in­fan­ti­cide. Even if you are not killing a real baby, you’re mak­ing peo­ple feel on a vis­ceral level that you are, which is suf­fer­ing in its own right. This is not a hy­po­thet­i­cal ar­gu­ment: at least a third of peo­ple in the United States think abor­tion should be il­le­gal in all cas­es. Such peo­ple are hor­ri­fied by abor­tion. Even if it does not ac­tu­ally in­volve killing ba­bies, these peo­ple think it does, and their hearts break in sym­pa­thy.</p>
<h3 id="slippery-slope-arguments">Slip­pery slope ar­gu­ments</h3>
<p>Abor­tion is the first step on the road to the de­struc­tion of the sanc­tity of hu­man life. Hu­man life must be sa­cred, not for re­li­gious or spir­i­tual rea­sons, but be­cause we are hu­mans and there­fore want the value of hu­man life to be en­shrined in the law. (One rea­son why sui­cide is il­le­gal in some places.) Be­cause of the sim­i­lar­ity morally be­tween late-term abor­tions and early in­fancy in­fan­ti­cide, there is a slip­pery slope to in­fan­ti­cide. But more gen­er­al­ly, al­low­ing hu­mans to kill other hu­mans al­ways makes hu­man life cheap­er.</p>
<p>Abor­tion can also lead to eu­gen­ics. Par­ents can screen their fe­tuses for cer­tain <span>traits<span>such as sex</span></span>, and abort if the they don’t like what they find. This logic has made fe­male in­fan­ti­cide in China not un­com­mon, so it’s easy to see how it could cause abor­tion, too. One of the prob­lems is that parental screen­ing of fe­tuses need not be log­i­cal. It will be more likely to be de­ter­mined by what is <span>fashionable<span>sex in China</span></span> and what is de­ter­mined to be de­sir­able given the so­cial and po­lit­i­cal cli­mate. </p>
<p>If peo­ple be­come much less likely to have autis­tic ba­bies, then those who do have autism will have less re­sources, be less un­der­stood by so­ci­ety, and be more likely to face dis­crim­i­na­tion. If the gen­der ra­tio be­comes to im­bal­anced, the prob­lems are ob­vi­ous. And any nar­row form of se­lec­tion can lead to loss of ge­netic di­ver­sity in the pop­u­la­tion. But be­yond just the util­i­tar­ian ar­gu­ment against eu­gen­ics via abor­tion, I think it’s a bit sad that we think some ba­bies just aren’t good enough to be born.</p>
<p>By per­mit­ting abor­tion, we tell moth­ers they are free to ab­di­cate their moth­er­hood. If you don’t want to be a moth­er, it’s okay, you don’t have to be a moth­er. This is an un­healthy mes­sage which may per­sist in the minds of women once they do de­cide to have a ba­by. If moth­er­hood is not a re­spon­si­bil­i­ty, but a choice, then moth­ers will be more likely to ne­glect their chil­dren or give up their older child for adop­tion when things get tough. The same ba­si­cally ap­plies to fa­ther­hood. If a man’s first re­ac­tion to hear­ing that he got a woman preg­nant is to plead with her to get an abor­tion, then he has been trained to run away from fa­ther­hood and not take the role se­ri­ous­ly. This is good for no­body.</p>
<h3 id="abortion-is-a-bad-decision">Abor­tion is a bad de­ci­sion</h3>
<p>In gen­er­al, peo­ple are not tak­ing the role of par­ent­hood serously any­more. Peo­ple would use abor­tion to put off par­ent­hood un­til a more con­ve­nient time, but we know from pos­i­tive psy­chol­ogy that build­ing a fam­ily is go­ing to have a much greater pos­i­tive im­pact on your hap­pi­ness than try­ing to ad­vance your ca­reer or lounge around for an­other decade. And pro­cras­ti­nat­ing par­ent­hood may lead to not be­ing able to see your grand­chil­dren grow up, or your chil­dren “make it” in the world. So why do peo­ple rou­tinely make the wrong choice in West­ern so­ci­ety? Abor­tion plays a role. It makes it easy not to see par­ent­hood as a re­spon­si­bil­ity and as a core part of the hu­man ex­pe­ri­ence, but rather as more of a hob­by, which some may be in­ter­ested in, and other peo­ple might try bowl­ing in­stead. If abor­tion should be il­le­gal, it should be to stop moth­ers from shoot­ing them­selves <span>in the foot<span>not to mention shooting the fetus in the head</span></span>. </p>
<h3 id="risk">Risk</h3>
<p>They say the risks of abor­tion are less than the risks of child­birth, and sci­ence con­firms this: one study showed the risk of death from giv­ing birth is 14 times higher than from abor­tion. This is given as an ar­gu­ment in fa­vor of the pro-­choice po­si­tion. The prob­lem with this ar­gu­ment is that it’s a false com­par­ison; many moth­ers who get abor­tions now end up hav­ing chil­dren later any­way, so the risk is ac­tu­ally <span>additive<span>abortion now + birth later vs. birth now</span></span>. When a woman un­der­goes mul­ti­ple abor­tions, the sub­se­quent abor­tions are also pro­gres­sively less safe, and can lead to, for ex­am­ple, Ash­er­man syn­drome, which can cause pain and in­fer­til­i­ty.

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hypervisor Memory Introspection (HVMI) relies on analyzing memory accesses in order to determine whether they are legitimate or not. For example, by analyzing the old memory value and the newly stored value, HVMI can decide whether to allow the modification or not. This, however, introduces the complication of needing to do an in-depth analysis of each instruction that modifies protected memory. Unlike a RISC architecture, x86 has a large number of instructions that may access memory in a complicated, read-modify-write (RMW) manner, and using complicated addressing schemes.
In order to simplify instruction decoding and analysis, a dedicated x86 instruction decoder has been created, capable of providing full instruction information, and thus alleviating the HVMI module from needing to know x86 instructions format. This blog post will detail some bddisasm internals, how to work with it, while highlighting why it is a critical part of HVMI. In addition, we will go through some particularities of x86 instruction encoding. The main bddisasm project is located <a href="https://github.com/bitdefender/bddisasm">here</a>, and the documentation can be accessed <a href="https://bddisasm.readthedocs.io/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bddisasm-overview">bddisasm Overview</h2>

<p>bddisasm is a standalone library, written in C, with some Python used for internal decoder-tables generation. The library is built to be fast, while providing as much information about the decoded instructions as possible - this is important, because other projects using bddisasm can rely on it to provide complete and accurate information about instructions. When considering other decoding libraries, there are only some which are similar in features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://intelxed.github.io/">Intel Xed</a>, which is written and maintained by Intel, thus somehow making it the standard x86 decoder; while not the fastest, it provides rich information about the decoded instructions;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/aquynh/capstone">Capstone</a>, which is basically a collection of decoders for multiple architectures;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/zyantific/zydis">ZyDis</a>, which is comparable to Xed as far as features go, and lightweight (however, when bddisasm was created internally, ZyDis did not exist yet);</li>
</ul>

<p>Other decoders written in other languages, such as Rust or C#, or disassembler (which only provide a textual output of the instruction, without providing actual decoded instruction information) were not considered. Given that Xed and Capstone seemed rather difficult to work with at that time, we decided to create a lightweight decoder of our own, with the following objectives in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight - written entirely in C, with no external dependencies, no memory allocated, and thread-safe by design;</li>
  <li>Fast - while we needed a decoder capable of providing as much information as possible about instructions, we still considered speed an important factor;</li>
  <li>Resilient - the decoder should be able to handle all kinds of malformed instructions, as well as valid instructions containing redundant prefixes, or encodings which are not typical;</li>
  <li>Complete - the decoder must support all existing x86 instructions, including AVX; moreover, extending the support to new instructions should be as simple as possible;</li>
  <li>Easy to work with - single-header file, single-API library, which provides all possible information in the output decoded instruction, without the need to call additional functions in order to extract information from the decoded instruction;</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not get into a comparison between bddisasm and other decoding libraries, and we will keep the focus of this blog post on how to work with bddisasm and how useful it is in HVMI.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-bddisasm">Working With bddisasm</h2>

<p>Working with the decoding library is easy: include the <code>bddisasm.h</code> header file, link with the <code>bddisasm.lib</code> (Windows) or <code>libbddisasm.a</code> (Linux), and call the decoding API! bddisasm uses a single-API decoding scheme, where the <code>NdDecode</code> APIs provide an output <code>INSTRUX</code> structure containing all the possible information about the instruction. The only thing not included in the <code>INSTRUX</code> structure is the textual disassembly of the instruction, which has to be generated separately using the <code>NdToText</code> API. A typical usage scenario might be the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "bddisasm/bddisasm.h"
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
     <span>INSTRUX</span> <span>ix</span><span>;</span>
     <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>ins</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>0x33</span><span>,</span> <span>0xC0</span> <span>};</span>
     <span>NDSTATUS</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>

     <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>NdDecodeEx</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ix</span><span>,</span> <span>ins</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>ins</span><span>),</span> <span>ND_CODE_64</span><span>,</span> <span>ND_DATA_64</span><span>);</span>
     <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>ND_SUCCESS</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>))</span>
     <span>{</span>
         <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Decoding failed with error 0x%08x!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>status</span><span>);</span>
         <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
     <span>}</span>

     <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Decoded instruction with length %d!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>ix</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="decoded-instruction-information">Decoded Instruction Information</h3>

<p>Note that the output <code>INSTRUX ix</code> structure will contain <em>all</em> the information about the decoded instruction. A comprehensive list about what kind of information you can find:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raw information about the instruction, such as prefixes, opcodes, modrm, SIB, displacement, immediate fields;</li>
  <li>Information about operand size, address size, vector length;</li>
  <li>Decoded prefix information, such as whether the instruction uses lock, is repeated, is xacquire/xrelease enabled or CET tracked;</li>
  <li>Length information, including about the instruction itself and different fields of the instruction, such as immediate fields or displacement;</li>
  <li>Offset information about each constituent field of the instruction (position of each field inside the instruction);</li>
  <li>Individual RFLAGS flags access mode: modified, tested, set, cleared and undefined;</li>
  <li>FPU flags access for <code>C0</code>, <code>C1</code>, <code>C2</code> and <code>C3</code> flags;</li>
  <li>AVX information, such as instruction exception class, tuple type, and rounding mode;</li>
  <li>Instruction category (example: CALL, RET, ARITH, LOGIC, etc.);</li>
  <li>Instruction set (example: I86, I64, MMX, SSE4, etc.);</li>
  <li>CPUID feature flag, which indicates the leaf and subleaf that must be queried, together with the register and bit which indicates support for that particular instruction;</li>
  <li>Valid operating modes for the instruction (example: real, protected, long, VMX root, etc.);</li>
  <li>Valid prefixes for the instruction (example: REP, LOCK, etc.);</li>
  <li>Valid decorators for AVX instructions (example: masking, broadcast, rounding, etc.);</li>
  <li>Instruction Mnemonic;</li>
  <li>Operand information, including: operand type, size, access (read, conditional read, write, conditional write) and details;</li>
  <li>Full memory operand details: segment, base, index, scale, compressed displacement, stack, string, bitbase, VSIB, etc.);</li>
  <li>Implicit operands information: registers, implicit memory locations, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples on how different kind if info can be extracted from <code>INSTRUX</code> can be found on the <a href="https://bddisasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">official documentation page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="textual-disassembly">Textual Disassembly</h3>

<p>Using the <code>NdToText</code> function, one can convert a decoded <code>INSTRUX</code> to a textual disassembly that can be printed. The <code>NdToText</code> function only supports Intel style syntax, so the following instruction <code>33C0</code> would be decoded as <code>XOR       eax, eax</code>, and <code>4833C0</code> would be decoded as <code>XOR       rax, rax</code>. Typical usage of the <code>NdToText</code> function is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>    <span>// Create the text disassembly for this instruction.</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>text</span><span>[</span><span>ND_MIN_BUF_SIZE</span><span>];</span>

    <span>NdToText</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ix</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>),</span> <span>text</span><span>);</span>

    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Instruction: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="bddisasm-in-hvmi">bddisasm in HVMI</h2>

<p>bddisasm is a critical part of the HVMI technology. As mentioned, decoding and analyzing instructions is important, since the vast majority of events HVMI is dealing with are EPT violations (memory-referencing instructions).</p>

<p>One of the first things HVMI does when an EPT violation takes place is to decode the offending instruction. Since accessing guest memory is usually slow (as it involves translating the guest linear address to a guest physical address, and mapping each physical page in the process - both page-tables and the actual page), once an instruction is decoded, it gets cached internally. Subsequent accesses from the same instruction pointer would yield an already decoded, cached instruction, thus speeding up this process (of course, caching instructions also implies that the pages containing them have to be monitored for modifications, in order to invalidate the cache if an instruction is modified).</p>

<p>Once the instruction has been decoded, HVMI will dissect it in order to determine each memory location accessed. This is important, because one instruction may directly, or indirectly, access multiple memory locations, and we have to analyze each access before allowing the instruction to continue. Since bddisasm provides full operand information (including implicit operands), HVMI will basically iterate through all the instruction operands, and check if they’re memory. For each memory operand, it would then make sure that it accesses a region of memory that is not monitored by HVMI. Examples of instructions that access multiple addresses might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CALL [mem]</code> - it reads the <code>[mem]</code> operand, and it writes the stack; it may also access the shadow stack, if CET Shadow Stack is enabled;</li>
  <li><code>MOVS</code> - it reads memory from <code>[rsi]</code>, and writes memory to <code>[rdi]</code>;</li>
  <li>AVX instruction using VSIB addressing - multiple addresses may be accessed by a VSIB operand such as <code>[rax+xmm0*8]</code>;</li>
  <li>MPX instructions <code>BNDLDX</code> and <code>BNDSTX</code>, which access the bounds tables;</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also some events (mostly asynchronous) which may cause EPT violations, even if the current instruction does not do any kind of memory access; such events include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delivery of interrupts or exceptions, which will read the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), and will write the interrupt frame on the stack;</li>
  <li>Accesses inside the Global Descriptor Table (GDT), as part of a descriptor load;</li>
  <li>Access inside the Task State Segment (TSS) as part of a task switch or interrupt delivery;</li>
  <li>Accesses inside page-tables, as part of page-walks (although these are distinctively indicated using a dedicated bit inside the VMCS EPT violation exit qualification);</li>
  <li>Other memory accesses, such as Processor Trace induced accesses, Branch Trace Stores accesses, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These types of events are not included in the <code>INSTRUX</code> structure, as they may occur in an asynchronous manner, during normal instruction execution.</p>

<p>Once the faulting instruction has been decoded, it gets analyzed by multiple modules inside Introcore, in order to determine whether it is a legitimate modification (this is used …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

		<p>Categorization, classification, segmentation - we, human beings, love labeling things and separating them into buckets. I am not an exception, and as someone who builds &amp; develops engineering teams, I have a habit of classifying ... <strong>engineers</strong>. Of course, there are many ways of doing that: by seniority, by area of expertise, by the type of products built. But what about categorizing the engineers by <u>their (unofficial) role in getting sh... stuff done</u>?</p><p>You've probably heard about the <em>'mercenaries VS missionaries'</em> distinction, but what I mean is something far more elaborate and detailed. And what is more, my goal is not only to present the essential engineer species I distinguish but also to clarify what happens (to the organization) if any particular group is underrepresented or even missing completely.</p><p>Here we go:</p><ol><li><strong>paratroopers </strong>- geniuses who hack through, carve the path, disrupt, break the unbreakable, and act far behind the front-lines - they may be 100% anti-social, live in their own world, not able to communicate and collaborate, but they'll do work no one else is capable of</li><li><strong>lifeguards</strong> - relentless firefighters, ones who are there always to save the day, because they genuinely care - whatever happens, they won't let it go underwater (even if they lack skill, they compensate with energy, sense of duty and commitment)</li><li><strong>sages</strong> - the only ones present who are here long enough to understand how things work and why (what was the original intent, concept, vision); they preserve the knowledge about the solution (usually because they played a significant role in its creation), w/o them it's just black magic and horror</li><li><strong>evangelists</strong> - ones with the mission, who genuinely believe in what the organization is doing - that it has a real meaning worth fighting for; they are here because they think this is an unique place where they can make a real difference (for clients, society, our common future, etc.)</li><li><strong>conductors</strong> - ones who tame the chaos, effectively orchestrate others to achieve more and move further, and have enough balls to make tough, out-of-script decisions when no-one else is eager to; they have a gift of simplifying and clarifying things, usually accompanied with a skill of visualizing the work</li><li><strong>binders</strong> - individuals who make others gel together, as something greater than the sum of the individuals; thanks to them, people feel like they really belong (to something unique and special) and make real bonds with co-workers</li><li><strong>wrestlers</strong> - ones who do the heavy lifting, make the difference, are always in the first row, never afraid of challenges and obstacles (but need to be directed by someone else); they set the standards high as the objective experts in their particular field (usually technical)</li><li><strong>cannon fodder</strong> - those who do not play any major role, but probably would like to (at some point) - for now: flexible 'task pushers' &amp; gap-fillers who tend to do 80% of all work; some have true potential, some are just useful, some have stalled their promising career</li><li><strong>deadwood</strong> - people who bring less value than they consume - many of them just DGAF &amp; require constant babysitting (don't mistake it with coaching/mentoring, please), but some just lack skills or are misfits in that particular context; deadwood can be very absorbing, decrease the overall productivity &amp; deteriorate any positive traits in the company's culture</li></ol><p>To be clear, these are roles, not positions - a single individual can easily qualify as a combination of some of these (e.g. a sage who is also a conductor), but not every combination makes sense (and hence exists in the wild, of course).</p><p>What happens if your team loses all ...</p><ul><li>... <strong>paratroopers</strong> - frankly ... opinions vary; on the one hand, they can spur the innovation for the whole organization and cause real break-throughs, but betting on individuals who are brilliant but nearly impossible to cooperate with doesn't sound like a sustainable strategy for gaining a competitive edge ...</li><li>... <strong>lifeguards</strong> - you're balancing on the edge of an abyss - if things go awry, there'll be no-one to save the day - no-one will feel obliged to fix the issue; people don't CARE anymore and find it completely normal (<em>"it's just a job, after all"</em>, <em>"we work 40h/week in this country"</em>, <em>"but why me?"</em>)</li><li>... <strong>sages</strong> - there's a high chance no-one will notice: for months or even (!) years, because no-one will admit the issue openly; but people will keep going workarounds/short-cuts (because goals have to be met anyway), tangling even more dependencies, breaking boundaries, obfuscating the past design decisions - the solution drifts from complicated towards complex or even chaos (Cynefin-wise)</li><li>... <strong>evangelists</strong> - it's much harder to keep a more profound sense of purpose - intrinsic motivations are more likely to dry out, what either drives people out (of the organization) or directs them towards more shallow (and temporary) motivations (which is a short-term strategy)</li><li>... <strong>conductors</strong> - everything engulfs either on chaos or in helpless stasis (or alternately in both of them), the team is not capable of anything that requires coordination/synchronization</li><li>... <strong>binders</strong> - people work together, but in separation, instead of acting as a team, they resemble an ensemble of 1-head-only "teams", each one with its own agenda, responsibility, commitments; it doesn't mean people won't help each other if needed, but that's just accidental support, not a true synergy</li><li>... <strong>wrestlers</strong> - there's no-one to set a proper tempo/standards, the mediocrity reigns and expectation threshold deteriorates; it's perceived as OK to be 'average' while it's uncool and anti-social to step ahead and express any ambition</li></ul><p><strong>Cannon fodder</strong> and <strong>deadwood </strong>should be considered separately: the former because it's quite unlikely you'll be running out of them and the latter due to the fact that you should do your best to identify and get rid of them promptly.</p><p>Forgetting temporarily about the <strong>paratroopers</strong> (each of them is unique and it's hard to find a common denominator for them), the groups above can be conveniently aggregated into two <em>"master categories"</em>:</p><ol><li><strong>lifeguards</strong>, <strong>sages </strong>and <strong>evangelists </strong>are roles <u>specific to your organization</u> - someone who was a sage in X obviously won't start with enough org-specific knowledge to immediately become a sage in Y; it also means that growing those roles takes time, effort and mentoring - if you're caught off-guard and lose such an individual unprepared, the reasonable replacement may be a huge issue (or even - impossible (!)); the organization stripped of its lifeguards, sages and evangelists is <u>purely vegetative</u> - frequently w/o realizing that</li><li><strong>conductors</strong>, <strong>binders</strong> and <strong>wrestlers</strong> are <u>generic roles</u>, based on individual traits and/or experience - being talented/skilled in one or more of those roles massively increases your value in the job market - every sensible employer looks for such talent, so such people are always in high demand</li></ol><hr><p>It's a good moment to summarize the thought train of this blog post. IMHO the essence of conscious, long-term team building (which is a key responsibility of every Engineering Leader/Manager) is to:</p><ul><li>for <strong>lifeguards</strong>, <strong>sages</strong> and <strong>evangelists</strong> you need to <u>control the outflow</u> - the risk is losing skills/knowledge/attitude that is very hard to replace; act by shadowing, pairing, doubling positions</li><li>for <strong>conductors</strong>, <strong>binders </strong>and <strong>wrestlers</strong> you need to <u>secure the steady, healthy (&amp; regular) inflow</u> - the risk is finding out one day that all your teams consist of cannon fodder - people who expect to be led, taught, directed, but not (YET) capable to play any major role</li><li>and for <strong>paratroopers</strong> - you need to consider individually whether your organization can effectively utilize such a sophisticated "weapon" for its own advantage, w/o actually hurting itself</li></ul><hr><p>P.S. Two groups I've considered but finally excluded from the least are <em>"leaders"</em> and<em> "gardeners"</em> (ones who help other grow) - for different reasons; when it comes to leaders I think that the "leadership" aspect is covered by the 3 organization-specific groups (lifeguards, sages, evangelists), and even if I find a "gardener" a very important role long-term, its impact on short-term GSD is limited.</p><p>P.S.S. Do you agree with the choice of those roles? Can you match them to key people in your engineering organization? Or maybe you have different categories you'd like to share? Feel free to let me know in the comments below - truly appreciated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>A senior French MEP has gone on hunger strike to demand the EU introduce a tax on financial markets and to protest against budget plans that downgraded programs on health, research and climate change. </p>
<p>“My goal is not to die but to avoid millions of deaths,” Pierre Larrouturou&nbsp;told POLITICO. “If there’s no financing, there is no agreement.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, European leaders agreed on a historic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-leaders-reach-deal-on-coronavirus-recovery-fund/">€1.82 trillion budget&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;coronavirus recovery package and laid out a path to add new bloc-wide sources of revenue to finance the EU budget, including a levy based on non-recycled plastic.&nbsp;But the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/sidelined-on-recovery-parliament-plans-battle-over-eu-budget/" target="_blank">European Parliament is unhappy with several aspects of the deal,</a> notably the lack of a strong mechanism to punish rule of law breaches by national capitals and cuts to some programs. </p>

<p>MEPs also want a definitive timetable for the introduction of a financial transaction tax —&nbsp;something the European Commission first proposed in 2011. Larrouturou said the tax, which advocates say would ensure that the financial sector contributes more fairly to tax revenues,&nbsp;would bring in €50 billion a year.</p>
<p>The French MEP, part of the socialist group in the Parliament, said he had his sights set on a meeting of EU finance ministers&nbsp;in December where he wants agreement to establish a financial transaction tax in 2024. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“There is something obscene in saying that there is no money for health, hospitals and climate when financial markets have never been at such a high level,” said Larrouturou, who as the rapporteur for the EU's 2021 annual budget is responsible for shepherding key legislation through Parliament.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;blamed the Council — as well as his own country, France — for blocking a proposal that has been on the table for years and would help economies to repay their debt.&nbsp;EU capitals have consistently resisted the introduction of such EU-wide revenue raising mechanisms&nbsp;to keep direct control over taxation.</p>
<p>The MEP&nbsp;also warned that a financial transaction tax would help countries avoid a tough recession in 2024 because “the landing will be brutal.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Those countries who say 'no' to the [financial transaction tax] — it means they prefer to help traders and tax voters,” he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Parliament must give its&nbsp;consent to the EU's multi-year budget running from 2021 to 2027, while the Council will also need to sign off on the final budget numbers.</p>

This is the iteration method I use most often in normal projects, but didn’t use as often in interviews because 1) <code>forEach()</code> will throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> if you try to modify the collection while iterating through it, and 2) a lot of interview problems require taking the index into account as well.</li><li id="bba2"><code>forEachIndexed()</code> is like <code>forEach()</code>, except you also have access to the element’s index inside the lambda, which you often need in interview problems.</li></ul><pre><span id="871c"><em>// Print elements at even indices.</em><br><strong>list.forEachIndexed { index, element -&gt; <br>    if (index % 2 == 0) println("$element")<br>}</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="bdcd"><code><em>..</em></code>, aka <code>rangeTo()</code>, can be used in the form of <code>for(i in a..b)</code> to create then iterate through a <code>Range</code>. The range would include both the start (<code>a</code>) and end (<code>b</code>) elements, so if you want to use it to iterate through a list/array, you should either write it as <code>for (i in 0..list.size-1)</code> or use <code>until</code> instead. Even though it’s most often used with <code>Int</code>s, you can iterate over <code>Char</code>s as well.</li></ul><pre><span id="6a58"><em>// Iterate and print from i = 0 to i = 100</em><br><strong>for (i in 0..100) { println(i) }</strong></span><span id="dcbf"><em>// Iterate from i = 0 to i = list.size-1</em><br><strong>for (i in 0..list.size-1) { println(list[i]) }</strong></span><span id="c139"><em>// Iterate and print 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'</em><br><strong>for (i in 'a'..'d') { println(i) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="8576"><code>downTo()</code> works like <code>..</code>, except each iteration goes down a step rather than up one.</li></ul><pre><span id="71b8"><em>// Iterate and print from i = 100 to i = 0</em><br><strong>for (i in 100 downTo 0) { println(i) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="85ed"><code>step()</code> lets you specify the change in values between each iteration.</li></ul><pre><span id="1f26"><em>// Iterate and print 1, 3, 5, 7</em><br><strong>for (i in 1..8 step 2) { println(i) }</strong></span><span id="9534"><em>// Iterate and print 8, 5, 2<br></em><strong>for (i in 8 downTo 1 step 3) { println(i) }</strong></span></pre><ul><li id="db3e"><code>until()</code> includes the start element, but not the end element.

This is up to personal preference.</p><pre><span id="75ad"><em>// Iterate through entries using a for-loop</em><br><strong>for ((key, value) in map) {<br>    println("$key = $value")<br>}</strong></span><span id="7b25"><em>// Iterate through entries using forEach()</em><br><strong>map.forEach { (key, value) -&gt; println("$key = $value") }</strong></span></pre><p id="bb64">If you only need to iterate through the keys, you can use the <code>keys</code> val to get a <code>Set</code> of all the keys in the map, and iterate through those.</p><pre><span id="227a"><strong>map.keys.forEach { println(it) }</strong></span></pre><p id="d489">Similarly, if you only need to iterate through the values, the <code>values</code> val will return a <code>Set</code> of all the values in the map.</p><pre><span id="989f"><strong>map.values.forEach { println(it) }</strong></span></pre><p id="6d5a"><code>PriorityQueue</code>s are helpful for when you want elements to be processed based on their priority. They’re often used in interview problems that ask for K-th largest, K-th smallest, top K frequent, etc. I covered them in more detail in Part 1, but here’s a reminder of what iterating through one looks like.</p><pre><span id="d1cb"><strong>val pq = PriorityQueue&lt;Int&gt;(listOf(2, 1, 3))</strong><br><em>// pq will be empty after 3 iterations</em><br><strong>while(pq.isNotEmpty()) {<br>    println(pq.poll()) </strong><em>// prints 1, then 2, then 3</em><strong><br>}</strong></span></pre><p id="eb71">That’s it for part 4!

<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Only works per session, i.e stats are gathered once you power up your PC (or login) and are lost when you shutdown.</li>
  <li>Good to have if you have limited data availability &amp; want to monitor your data usage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s just review on what utilities we used here.</p>

<h2 id="ip"><code>ip</code></h2>

<p>Our first step is to find your default networking device (i.e the default networking interface) and its name.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>default via 192.168.42.129 dev enp0s20u4u1 proto dhcp metric 100 
169.254.0.0/16 dev enp0s20u4u1 scope <span>link </span>metric 1000 
192.168.42.0/24 dev enp0s20u4u1 proto kernel scope <span>link </span>src 192.168.42.149 metric 100
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first line of output lists our default network interface (the string followed by your PC name, mine is <code>dev</code>). The interface name will be different in your case.</p>

<h2 id="ifconfig"><code>ifconfig</code></h2>

<p>This is a good old tool used by network professionals to configure a network interface. <code>ifconfig $net_device</code> will display the status of our default net device.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ifconfig enp0s20u4u1
enp0s20u4u1: <span>flags</span><span>=</span>4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.42.149  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.42.255
        inet6 fe80::d464:9bdb:2b16:b27  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20&lt;<span>link</span><span>&gt;</span>
        inet6 2405:204:322e:53d:18ef:6496:fbb7:9309  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0&lt;global&gt;
        inet6 2405:204:322e:53d:93c3:cff8:8680:78bb  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0&lt;global&gt;
        ether 96:a3:91:8e:68:de  txqueuelen 1000  <span>(</span>Ethernet<span>)</span>
  <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span>   RX packets 19334  bytes 14292555 <span>(</span>14.2 MB<span>)</span>
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
  <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span>   TX packets 16514  bytes 3008589 <span>(</span>3.0 MB<span>)</span>
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You see the <code>RX</code> and <code>TX</code> packets? Yup that’s our stats. Now we will use <code>awk</code> to extract those packet infos.</p>

<h2 id="awk"><code>awk</code></h2>

<p>AWK is a pattern scanning language, generally used for data manipulation needs.</p>

<p>Now, this is not a tutorial about awk but let’s just understand our use-case here. A simple awk statement might look like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>awk</span> <span>'/pattern/ { action }'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So in our case, we want to look for <em>pattern</em> which matches <code>TX packets</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ifconfig enp0s20u4u1 |  <span>awk</span> <span>'/TX packets/'</span>
        TX packets 18554  bytes 3411366 <span>(</span>3.4 MB<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Meh, this doesn’t look good. We want that human-readable format <code>3.4MB</code>. One thing which excites me is that we can access/read each individual field (or word or record) in that line. Each word can then be printed using <code>print $&lt;field-no&gt;</code> (an <a href="http://kirste.userpage.fu-berlin.de/chemnet/use/info/gawk/gawk_9.html#SEC87"><em>action</em></a>)</p>

	<figcaption>I know the last two rows are f**ked up. Maybe its a bug ?</figcaption>
</picture>

<p>Now we just print both the <code>$6</code> and <code>$7</code> fields.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ifconfig enp0s20u4u1 |  <span>awk</span> <span>'/TX packets/ { print $6$7 }'</span>
<span>(</span>5.7MB<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And of course, you can <code>watch</code> this script to get real-time feedback as well.</p>

<p>Also, have you ever been a class monitor in your school? I was once in 9th grade :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of its mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

<iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0On19DRA2fU?start=88" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="lazy lazy-hidden mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></center><p>Truthfully, we’re all being held hostage. I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

November 4, 2020 | http://www.kamilonurozkaleli.com/posts/starbucks-singapore-account-takeover/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.kamilonurozkaleli.com/posts/starbucks-singapore-account-takeover/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<h3 id="recon"><strong>Recon</strong></h3>
<p>While browsing Starbucks Singapore, I noticed a page loaded with content from a 3rd party site. Let’s call this site <em>example.com</em> in order not to disclose it. When I did some research on this site, I saw the same login page on <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> in the directory example.com/starbucks, and at this point I had two possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>This application can be an environment where current developments of <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> are made and tested.</li>
<li>Or it may have been used as an old test environment and is in an idle state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both possibilities increased the probability of a bug here, but the main problem is that I did not know whether a bug I will find here would affect the production environment. To understand this, I created a user account at card.starbucks.com.sg and tried to log into example.com/starbucks with this account. BINGO! I was able to successfully login with the account I just created. Both applications seemed to be using the same authentication mechanism.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.kamilonurozkaleli.com/images/starbucks-1.png" alt="Scheme-1, both applications are using same database table."></p>
<h3 id="exploitation"><strong>Exploitation</strong></h3>
<p>From this point I browsed example.com/starbucks and discovered an endpoint which does not exist in the production app. The POST data this endpoint received was as follows.</p>
<p><code>email=hacker@hacker.com</code></p>
<p>When I write the email address of the account I want to takeover in the email parameter here and send a request, I saw the partial information of the account belonging to that email address on my profile page. I could not fully takeover the account yet, and my password change request was not successful due to the invalid CSRF token generated in this application.</p>
<p>To get around this, I copied the PHPSESSID cookie value from example.com/starbucks to card.starbucks.com.sg and BOOM! I was able to see all the information belongs to victim in the production environment, the valid CSRF tokens generated here allowed me to change the password and I was able to completely takeover an account whose e-mail address I know.</p>
<h3 id="impact"><strong>Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Except for seeing all personal information belonging to users and completely taking over the accounts, if there is a loaded credit in the user account, these credits can be spent in Starbucks stores via the mobile application.</p>
<h3 id="multiplying-the-reward"><strong>Multiplying the Reward</strong></h3>
<p>I came across two other test environments on example.com. Let’s call them <em>example.com/starbucks2</em> and <em>example.com/starbucks3</em>. With my account at card.starbucks.com.sg, I was not able to login to either test environment. example.com/starbucks2 did not allow me to create a new account, so I tried my luck at example.com/starbucks3 and successfully created a new account. Things get a little complicated here, I will try to explain it as simply as possible.</p>
<p>I think the applications example.com/starbucks2 and example.com/starbucks3 were using test tables, so users in production could not login in these applications.</p>
<p>With the account I created at example.com/starbucks3, I was able to log in to example.com/starbucks2, but not card.starbucks.com.sg. However, the PHPSESSID I copied from example.com/starbucks2 was valid on card.starbucks.com.sg and I could use that account. Considering all the scenarios, I created a chain here as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a dummy account with the victim’s email address at example.com/starbucks3. (Add to testusers table.)</li>
<li>At example.com/starbucks2, associate the account for that email with your own account via the same endpoint. (Associate the PHPSESSID with the email in the testusers table.)</li>
<li>Copy the PHPSESSID to card.starbucks.com.sg and takeover. (Takeover the real account of the same email address in the production users table.)</li>
</ol>

November 4, 2020 | https://mhasbini.com/blog/lets-build-an-http-client.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mhasbini.com/blog/lets-build-an-http-client.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<h2>What?</h2>

<p>
  Continuing with the same theme as the previous post (<a href="https://mhasbini.com/blog/lets-build-a-web-framework.html" target="_blank">Let's build a (nano) web framework</a>), in this post we'll be bulding a nano http client similar to <a href="https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3" target="_blank">urllib3</a>.
</p>


<h2>Introducing httpy</h2>

<p>
  The http client will be built using Python. Here's the usage we're aiming to get:
</p>

    <pre><code><span>import</span> httpy

req <span>=</span> httpy<span>.</span>get<span>(</span><span>'http://httpbin.org/robots.txt'</span><span>)</span>

req<span>.</span>status 
req<span>.</span>data </code></pre>


<p>
    To achieve this, we need to build:

    </p><ol>
        <li><b>URL parser</b>: This will allow us to get from the string <code>http://httpbin.org/robots.txt</code> to know what the scheme, host &amp; path are.</li>
        <li><b>Communication function</b>: This will send the HTTP request and get the raw response.</li>
        <li><b>HTTP response parser</b>: This will allow us to parse the raw HTTP response to get the response status and the page content.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>How deep are we gonna go?</h3>

<p>
  We're going to basing our work on Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" target="_blank"><code>socket</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/" target="_blank">pyparsing</a> libraries.
</p>

<h3>Compromises</h3>

<p>
  As this is experiment is to get an mvp, these are the compromises for this library:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Only work with HTTP</li>
    <li>URL's format is only a subset.</li>
    <li>Only IPV4</li>
</ul>

<h2>URL parser</h2>

<p>
    The usage will be:

    </p><pre><code><span>try</span><span>:</span>
    host<span>,</span> port<span>,</span> path <span>=</span> parse_url<span>(</span><span>'http://httpbin.org/robots.txt'</span><span>)</span>
<span>except</span> ValueError <span>as</span> e<span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span>
    exit<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre>



<p>
    Let's start by having a couple of test cases. I'm going to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html" target="_blank">doctest</a> for the examples.

    </p><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>parse_url</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Pase url based on this format:

    http://host[:port]path[?query][#fragment]

    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://httpbin.org/')
    ('httpbin.org', 80, '/')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://httpbin.org/robots.txt')
    ('httpbin.org', 80, '/robots.txt')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://test:1234/lorem?a=b#c')
    ('test', 1234, '/lorem?a=b')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('https://mhasbini.com/')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Invalid URL
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('httpmhasbini.com')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Invalid URL
    """</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>""</span></code></pre>



<p>
    We can define a context-free grammar to parse the url based on the specified format.

    I opted to use <a href="https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/" target="_blank">pyparsing</a> to achieve this.

    The grammar is as follow:

    </p><pre><code><span>import</span> pyparsing <span>as</span> pp

host_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>Word<span>(</span>pp<span>.</span>alphanums <span>+</span> <span>'.'</span> <span>+</span> pp<span>.</span>alphas<span>)</span><span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'host'</span><span>)</span>
port_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>pyparsing_common<span>.</span>signed_integer<span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'port'</span><span>)</span>
path_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>Combine<span>(</span><span>'/'</span> <span>+</span> pp<span>.</span>Optional<span>(</span>pp<span>.</span>Word<span>(</span>pp<span>.</span>srange<span>(</span><span>"[a-zA-Z0-9.-_~!$&amp;'()*+,;=:@]"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>)</span>
fragment_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>Optional<span>(</span><span>'#'</span> <span>+</span> pp<span>.</span>Word<span>(</span>pp<span>.</span>srange<span>(</span><span>"[a-zA-Z0-9/?"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'fragment'</span><span>)</span></code></pre>



<p>
    This is a simple implementation that only supports http and don't adhear completely to the syntax specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target="_blank">rfc3986</a> but is good enough for our mvp.
</p>

<p>
    What's left is to compine these two parts while capturing parsing exceptions and returing the values in the correct format:

    </p><pre><code><span>import</span> pyparsing <span>as</span> pp

<span>def</span> <span>parse_url</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Pase url based on this format:

    http://[host[:port]]path[?query][#fragment]

    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://httpbin.org/')
    ('httpbin.org', 80, '/')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://httpbin.org/robots.txt')
    ('httpbin.org', 80, '/robots.txt')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('http://test:1234/lorem?a=b#c')
    ('test', 1234, '/lorem?a=b')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('https://mhasbini.com/')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Invalid URL
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_url('httpmhasbini.com')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Invalid URL
    """</span>

    host_pp <span>=</span> pp<span>.</span>Word<span>(</span>pp<span>.</span>alphanums <span>+</span> <span>'.'</span> <span>+</span> pp<span>.</span>alphas<span>)</span><span>.</span>setResultsName<span>(</span><span>'host'</span><span>)</span>

<h2>Communication function</h2>

<p>
    This is the main part of the library, the usage will be:

    </p><pre><code><span>try</span><span>:</span>
    raw_response <span>=</span> get<span>(</span>host<span>,</span> port<span>,</span> path<span>)</span>
<span>except</span> ConnectionError <span>as</span> e<span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span>
    exit<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre>



<p>
    As usual, we start with defining a couple of test cases:

    </p><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> port<span>,</span> path<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Open connection and send GET HTTP request and return raw response

    &gt;&gt;&gt; get('httpbin.org', 80, '/robots.txt') # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
    'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\nDate: ...\\r\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\r\\nContent-Length: 30\\r\\nConnection: close\\r\\nServer: gunicorn/19.9.0\\r\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\\r\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\\r\\n\\r\\nUser-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; get('mhasbini.com', 1234, '/robots.txt')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    tt2.ConnectionError: [Errno 113] No route to host
    """</span>

    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></code></pre>



<p>
    To execute this logic, we need to:
    </p><ol>
        <li>Construct the request hearder.</li>
        <li>Open socket and send the request: We'll use <code>socket.AF_INET</code> family because we're only supporting ipv4 and <code>code.SOCK_STREAM</code> type because we're using TCP.</li>
        <li>Read the response a chunk at a time and then return it.</li>
    </ol>



<p>
    Putting the above requirements into code:

    </p><pre><code><span>import</span> socket

<span>class</span> <span>ConnectionError</span><span>(</span>OSError<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Raised when a socket connection fail for any reason"""</span>
    <span>pass</span>

<h2>HTTP response parser</h2>

<p>
    This is the final step where we take the raw response from the function above and parse it to get the status code and the response body. The API is as follow:
</p>

    <pre><code>status<span>,</span> body <span>=</span> parse_response<span>(</span>response<span>)</span></code></pre>


<p>Example of responses:</p>

    <pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1 <span>200 OK</span></span>
 Thu, 05 Nov 2020 00:05:19 GMT
 text/plain
 30
 close
 gunicorn/19.9.0
 *
 true

 *
 /deny</code></pre>


    <pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1 <span>404 NOT FOUND</span></span>
 Thu, 05 Nov 2020 00:05:46 GMT
 text/html
 233
 close
 gunicorn/19.9.0
 *
 true<span>

<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>404 Not Found<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Not Found<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>The requested URL was not found on the server.  If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre>



<p>
    We start by defining test cases:
</p>

    <pre><code><span>def</span> <span>parse_response</span><span>(</span>raw_response<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"""Parse raw http response and return status code and body.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_response('HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\nDate: Thu, 05 Nov 2020 03:22:48 GMT\\r\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\r\\nContent-Length: 30\\r\\nConnection: close\\r\\nServer: gunicorn/19.9.0\\r\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\\r\\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\\r\\n\\r\\nUser-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n')
    (200, 'User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; parse_response('lorem ipsum')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: Invalid raw response
    """</span>

    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></code></pre>


<p>
    The headers and the body are seperated by <code>\r\n\r\n</code> so we parse it as follow:
</p>

<h2>Plugging everything together</h2>

<p>
    This is the final step where we plug everything together and some syntactic sugar.

<p>The Linux Commands Handbook follows the 80/20 rule: you’ll learn 80% of a topic in around 20% of the time you spend studying it.</p>
<p>I find that this approach gives you a well-rounded overview.</p>
<p>This handbook does not try to cover everything under the sun related to Linux and its commands. It focuses on the small core commands that you will use the 80% or 90% of the time, and tries to simplify the usage of the more complex ones.</p>
<p>All these commands work on Linux, macOS, WSL, and anywhere you have a UNIX environment.</p>
<p>I hope the contents of this handbook will help you achieve what you want: <strong>getting comfortable with Linux</strong>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://flaviocopes.com/page/linux-commands-handbook/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to download this handbook in PDF / ePUB / Mobi format</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<h2 id="introductiontolinuxandshells">Introduction to Linux and shells</h2>
<h3 id="whatislinux">What is Linux?</h3>
<p>Linux is an operating system, like macOS or Windows.</p>
<p>It is also the most popular Open Source operating system, and it gives you a lot of freedom.</p>
<p>It powers the vast majority of the servers that compose the Internet. It’s the base upon which everything is built. But not just that. Android is based on (a modified version of) Linux.</p>
<p>The Linux “core” (called a <em>kernel</em>) was born in 1991 in Finland, and it has come a really long way from its humble beginnings. It went on to be the kernel of the GNU Operating System, creating the duo GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>There’s one thing about Linux that corporations like Microsoft, Apple, and Google will never be able to offer: the freedom to do whatever you want with your computer.</p>
<p>They’re actually going in the opposite direction, building walled gardens, especially on the mobile side.</p>
<p>Linux is the ultimate freedom.</p>
<p>It is developed by volunteers, some paid by companies that rely on it, some independently. But there’s no single commercial company that can dictate what goes into Linux, or the project’s priorities.</p>
<p>You can also use Linux as your day to day computer. I use macOS because I really enjoy the applications and design (and I also used to be an iOS and Mac apps developer). But before using macOS I used Linux as my main computer Operating System.</p>
<p>No one can dictate which apps you can run, or “call home” with apps that track you, your position, and more.</p>
<p>Linux is also special because there’s not just “one Linux”, like is the case with Windows or macOS. Instead, we have <strong>distributions</strong>.</p>
<p>A “distro” is made by a company or organization and packages the Linux core with additional programs and tooling.</p>
<p>For example you have Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, probably the most popular distributions.</p>
<p>But many, many more exist. You can create your own distribution, too. But most likely you’ll use a popular one that has lots of users and a community of people around it. This lets you do what you need to do without losing too much time reinventing the wheel and figuring out answers to common problems.</p>
<p>Some desktop computers and laptops ship with Linux preinstalled. Or you can install it on your Windows-based computer, or on a Mac.</p>
<p>But you don’t need to disrupt your existing computer just to get an idea of how Linux works.</p>
<p>I don’t have a Linux computer.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, you just need to know that under the hood macOS is a UNIX Operating System. It shares a lot of the same ideas and software that a GNU/Linux system uses, because GNU/Linux is a free alternative to UNIX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNIX</a> is an umbrella term that groups many operating systems used in big corporations and institutions, starting from the 70’s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The macOS terminal gives you access to the same exact commands I’ll describe in the rest of this handbook.</p>
<p>Microsoft has an official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> which you can (and should!) install on Windows. This will give you the ability to run Linux in a very easy way on your PC.</p>
<p>But the vast majority of the time you will run a Linux computer in the cloud via a VPS (Virtual Private Server) like DigitalOcean.</p>
<h3 id="whatisashell">What is a shell?</h3>
<p>A shell is a command interpreter that exposes an interface to the user to work with the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users advanced features like being able to create scripts.</p>
<p>This is important: shells let you perform things in a more optimized way than a GUI (Graphical User Interface) could ever possibly let you do. Command line tools can offer many different configuration options without being too complex to use.</p>
<p>There are many different kind of shells. This post focuses on Unix shells, the ones that you will find commonly on Linux and macOS computers.</p>
<p>Many different kind of shells were created for those systems over time, and a few of them dominate the space: Bash, Csh, Zsh, Fish and many more!</p>
<p>All shells originate from the Bourne Shell, called <code>sh</code>. “Bourne” because its creator was Steve Bourne.</p>
<p>Bash means <em>Bourne-again shell</em>. <code>sh</code> was proprietary and not open source, and Bash was created in 1989 to create a free alternative for the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. Since projects had to pay to use the Bourne shell, Bash became very popular.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, try opening your Mac terminal. By default it runs ZSH (or, pre-Catalina, Bash).</p>
<p>You can set up your system to run any kind of shell – for example I use the Fish shell.</p>
<p>Each single shell has its own unique features and advanced usage, but they all share a common functionality: they can let you execute programs, and they can be programmed.</p>
<p>In the rest of this handbook we’ll see in detail the most common commands you will use.</p>

<h2 id="the-man-command">The <code>man</code> command</h2>
<p>The first command I’ll introduce will help you understand all the other commands.</p>
<p>Every time I don’t know how to use a command, I type <code>man &lt;command&gt;</code> to get the manual:</p>

<p>This is a man (from <em>_manual_</em>) page. Man pages are an essential tool to learn as a developer. They contain so much information that sometimes it’s almost too much.<br>The above screenshot is just 1 of 14 screens of explanation for the <code>ls</code> command.</p>
<p>Most of the time when I need to learn a command quickly I use this site called <strong>tldr pages</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://tldr.sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tldr.sh</a>. It’s a command you can install, which you then run like this: <code>tldr &lt;command&gt;</code>. It gives you a very quick overview of a command, with some handy examples of common usage scenarios:</p>

<p>This is not a substitute for <code>man</code>, but a handy tool to avoid losing yourself in the huge amount of information present in a <code>man</code> page. Then you can use the <code>man</code> page to explore all the different options and parameters you can use on a command.</p>
<h2 id="the-ls-command">The <code>ls</code> command</h2>

<p>Inside a folder you can list all the files that the folder contains using the <code>ls</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>ls
</code></pre>
<p>If you add a folder name or path, it will print that folder’s contents:</p>
<pre><code>ls /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><code>ls</code> accepts a lot of options. One of my favorite combinations is <code>-al</code>. Try it:</p>
<pre><code>ls -al /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Compared to the plain <code>ls</code> command, this returns much more information.</p>
<p>You have, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>the file permissions (and if your system supports ACLs, you get an ACL flag as well)</li>
<li>the number of links to that file</li>
<li>the owner of the file</li>
<li>the group of the file</li>
<li>the file size in bytes</li>
<li>the file’s last modified datetime</li>
<li>the file name</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of data is generated by the <code>l</code> option. The <code>a</code> option instead also shows the hidden files.</p>
<p>Hidden files are files that start with a dot (<code>.</code>).</p>

<h2 id="thecdcommand">The <code>cd</code> command</h2>
<p>Once you have a folder, you can move into it using the <code>cd</code> command. <code>cd</code> means <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory. You invoke it specifying a folder to move into. You can specify a folder name, or an entire path.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
cd fruits
</code></pre>
<p>Now you are in the <code>fruits</code> folder.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>..</code> special path to indicate the parent folder:</p>
<pre><code>cd .. #back to the home folder
</code></pre>
<p>The # character indicates the start of the comment, which lasts for the entire line after it’s found.</p>
<p>You can use it to form a path:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
mkdir cars
cd fruits
cd ../cars
</code></pre>
<p>There is another special path indicator which is <code>.</code>, and indicates the <strong>current</strong> folder.</p>
<p>You can also use absolute paths, which start from the root folder <code>/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cd /etc
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-pwd-command">The <code>pwd</code> command</h2>

<p>Whenever you feel lost in the filesystem, call the <code>pwd</code> command to know where you are:</p>
<pre><code>pwd
</code></pre>
<p>It will print the current folder path.</p>

<h2 id="the-mkdir-command">The <code>mkdir</code> command</h2>

<p>You create folders using the <code>mkdir</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can create multiple folders with one command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir dogs cars
</code></pre>
<p>You can also create multiple nested folders by adding the <code>-p</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p fruits/apples
</code></pre>
<p>Options in UNIX commands commonly take this form. You add them right after the command name, and they change how the command behaves. You can often combine multiple options, too.</p>
<p>You can find which options a command supports by typing <code>man &lt;commandname&gt;</code>. Try now with <code>man mkdir</code> for example (press the <code>q</code> key to esc the man page). Man pages are the amazing built-in help for UNIX.</p>

<h2 id="the-rmdir-command">The <code>rmdir</code> command</h2>

<p>Just as you can create a folder using <code>mkdir</code>, you can delete a folder using <code>rmdir</code>:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
rmdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can also delete multiple folders at once:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits cars
rmdir fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>The folder you delete must be empty.</p>
<p>To delete folders with files in them, we’ll use the more generic <code>rm</code> command which deletes files and folders, using the <code>-rf</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>Be careful as this command does not ask for confirmation and it will immediately remove anything you ask it to remove.</p>
<p>There is no <strong>bin</strong> when removing files from the command line, and recovering lost files can be hard.</p>

<h2 id="the-mv-command">The <code>mv</code> command</h2>

<p>Once you have a file, you can move it around using the <code>mv</code> command. You specify the file current path, and its new path:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
mv pear new_pear
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pear</code> file is now moved to <code>new_pear</code>. This is how you <strong>rename</strong> files and folders.</p>
<p>If the last parameter is a folder, the file located at the first parameter path is going to be moved into that folder. In this case, you can specify a list of files and they will all be moved in the folder path identified by the last parameter:</p>
<pre><code>touch pear
touch apple
mkdir fruits
mv pear apple fruits #pear and apple moved to the fruits folder
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-cp-command">The <code>cp</code> command</h2>

<p>You can copy a file using the <code>cp</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
cp apple another_apple
</code></pre>
<p>To copy folders you need to add the <code>-r</code> option to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>If you’re thinking of developing an app, and you’ve consulted the internet on it, you’ve most probably noticed that these two terminologies pop up a lot — Native and Hybrid. What do they mean? How are they different? Which would be better for the nature of your business?</p>
<!--more--><p>Let’s tackle all these burning questions today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how we’ll do it: We’ll define the terms, distinguish them, and then study which piece fits into your priorities and business goals better.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding What They Are</strong></h2>
<p>Before getting into the nitty gritty, let’s lay down a quick overview of these terminologies.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Native Apps</strong></h3>
<p>As long as you have a basic understanding of apps, you’d know that smartphones run on either iOS or Android platforms, right? Easy. Basically, native applications are developed specifically for a particular mobile operating system using a software development kit like Java for Android, and Objective-C or Swift for iOS.</p>
<p>The end result of a native app often “feels right” because users have the ability to interact with features in the mobile device’s operating system like GPS, camera, microphone, contact list etc. Given its mature ecosystem, native apps definitely have the advantage of faster performance compared to hybrid apps. Being consistent and similar with other native apps, users will generally learn to navigate your app faster.</p>
<p>At least 80% of the apps on your smartphone are built on native development kits. Take Instagram or your favourite mobile game for an example — these apps that depend on HD graphics and smooth user experience definitely perform better as native apps.</p>
<h3><strong>Hybrid Apps</strong></h3>
<p>Hybrid apps, on the other hands, are basically web apps within an app. They’re built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS and run in a simplified browser (or, webview) on what looks and feels like a native app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hybrid apps are typically easier and require less time to develop, compared to native apps. They also require less maintenance and are easier to scale. Most companies opt for hybrid development because they can get the app to market fast, as the apps can be built on a single codebase and released onto multiple platforms quick and easy.</p>
<p><span><strong>Defining Your Goals</strong></span></p>
<p>When it comes to deciding which route to take, there are no cookie cutter, one-size-fits-all answers. There are a few things you will need to consider to weigh your odds — user experience, time to market, app performance, and maintenance. Your personal preferences for these factors make the compass that will point you to the right direction.</p>

<span><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=600&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg" alt="user experience" width="600" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=300&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 300w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=600&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 600w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=900&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 900w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=1200&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 1200w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 1500w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/user%20experience.jpg?width=1800&amp;name=user%20experience.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></span>

<h3><strong>User Experience</strong></h3>
<p>User experience has always been the top factor of an app’s success in user retention. In this millennial age, smartphones have become very personal devices for everyone. We carry them everywhere we go, from the moment we get out of bed to the moment right before we get back into bed. Having a responsive and reliable device that allows us to easily obtain the information we need at any time is one of the reasons why it’s so important to us.</p>
<p><a href="https://buildfire.com/app-statistics/#:~:text=Even%20though%20the%20average%20person,t%20get%20used%20every%20month."><span>Buildfire’s statistics</span></a> on mobile usage indicates that, even though the average person uses 25 apps per month, 96% of the time spent on their devices is split across only 10 apps. What is the reason? Yes, you know it. People are downloading apps, but they’re not using them. As a matter of fact, 75% of apps are used only once after being downloaded, and then within the snap of a finger — users churn.</p>
<p>So, let's link it back to why choosing the technology you build your app on is crucial. Psychologically, users' needs are pretty simple. They buy a new device, spend some time learning to navigate, learn about its features, and they’re done. They don’t want to have to solve a new maze everytime they download a new app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with that in mind, the important question to ask yourself before building an app is this: How do I make my app easy to navigate and avoid having users feel like they’re in a maze? The answer is simple — by creating a seamless experience with the platform’s extensive style guide from controls to visuals.</p>
<p>Since native apps are developed for and to be consistent with the ecosystem within the specific operating systems, you can rest assured that user experience won’t be compromised.</p>
<p>Hybrid however, is a risk for user experience, even with the most brilliant UX designs. The difference in style guidelines on hybrid apps could interfere with the success of your application.</p>
<h3><strong>Time To Market</strong></h3>
<p>If time is a major concern, then hybrid apps might be the best solution for you. If you have 6 months or more to spare, however, opt for native solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your goal right now is to get your product to market as quickly as possible, and you’re willing to sacrifice performance and user experience, go hybrid. Hybrid apps have a shorter development time as the app is built on a single source code and can be released onto multiple platforms.</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to start with hybrid if you’re testing the viability of your project. After seeing positive feedback, perhaps you can confidently switch to native to penetrate a bigger market.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>App Performance</strong></h3>
<p>After all that’s said, it’s pretty obvious that native would win this category. Native apps are faster and more seamless in the sense that when a user navigates through the app, all its contents, visuals and structure readily fit on their device.</p>
<p>As for hybrid, content and data are loaded from the server. How might this affect performance? When servers are taken into account, we need to consider the number of requests being made to a server, or, how many people are trying to reach that server. The higher the traffic, the slower the performance of your app.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>App Updates</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to tech and product development, there’s no such thing as bug-free software that never needs updates. Development teams will always find room for improvement. So the difference lies in the frequency of your updates and what actions are required from your users to acquire the updates. This will all have an impact on how well your app is received.</p>
<p>Hybrid apps don't require users to update through app stores. Once the update is applied on the page that is loaded from the server, users who navigate through the app can instantly see the update.</p>
<p>Native app users, on the other hand, will need to go through the app stores for updates before they see the changes. This won’t be any extra work for those who have automatic updates enabled on their devices, but what about those who don’t? Will frequent updates frustrate them and affect their perception of your app? This will be something for you to consider.</p>
<h2><strong>Next Step For You</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to deciding which technology to build your application on, both native and hybrid have their respective advantages and disadvantages. What you need to do is weigh the pros and cons, and decide what risks you’re willing or unwilling to take. If your business is on a tight deadline and going hybrid is your only option, just be aware of the tradeoffs that you are putting on the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, it’s no question that native apps make a bigger impact in the long run. Your initial investment will definitely be higher, but the end result of better user experience and performance might be worth taking the leap for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good things come to those who wait?</p>



<p>When I created and started hosting the first websites for curl I didn’t care about the URL or domain names used for them, but after a few years I started to think that maybe it would be cool to register a curl domain for its home. By then it was too late to find an available name under a “sensible” top-level domain and since then I’ve been on the lookout for one.</p>



<h2>Yeah, I host it</h2>



<p>So yes, I’ve administrated every machine that has ever hosted the curl web site going all the way back to the time before we called the tool curl. I’m also doing most of the edits and polish of the web content, even though I’m crap at web stuff like CSS and design. So yeah, I consider it my job to care for the site and make sure it runs smooth and that it has a proper (domain) name.</p>



<h2>www.fts.frontec.se</h2>



<p>The first ever curl web page was hosted on “<code>www.fts.frontec.se/~dast/curl</code>” in the late 1990s (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202234521/http://www.fts.frontec.se/%7Edast/curl/">snapshot</a>). I worked for the company with that domain name at the time and ~dast was the location for my own personal web content.</p>



<h2>curl.haxx.nu</h2>



<p>The curl website moved to its first “own home”, with curl.haxx.nu in August 1999 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013093821/http://curl.haxx.nu/">snapshot</a>) when we registered our first domain and the .nu top-level domain was available to us when .se wasn’t.</p>



<h2>curl.haxx.se</h2>



<p>We switched from curl.haxx.nu to curl.haxx.se in the summer of 2000 (when finally were allowed to register our name in the .se TLD) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001017164421/https://curl.haxx.se/">snapshot</a>).</p>



<p>The name “haxx” in the domain has been the reason for many discussions and occasional concerns from users and overzealous blocking-scripts over the years. I’ve kept the curl site on that domain since it is the name of one of the primary <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/sponsors.html">curl sponsors</a> and partly because I want to teach the world that a particular word in a domain is not a marker for badness or something like that. And of course because we have not bought or been provided a better alternative.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.haxx.se/">Haxx</a> is still the name of the company I co-founded back in 1997 so I’m also the admin of the domain.</p>



<h2>curl.se</h2>



<p>I’ve looked for and contacted owners of curl under many different TLDs over the years but most have never responded and none has been open for giving up their domains. I’ve always had an extra attention put on <code>curl.se</code> because it is in the Swedish TLD, the same one we have for Haxx and where I live.</p>



<h2>The curling background</h2>



<p>The first record on archive.org of anyone using the domain <code>curl.se</code> for web content is dated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030830002347/http://www.curl.se/">August 2003</a> when the Swedish curling team “Härnösands CK” used it. They used the domain and website for a few years under this name. It can be noted that it was team <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anette_Norberg">Anette Norberg</a>, which subsequently won two Olympic gold medals in the sport.</p>



<p>In September 2007 the site was renamed, still being about the sport curling but with the name “the curling girls” in Swedish (<em>curlingtjejerna</em>) which remained there for just 1.5 years until it changed again. “curling team Folksam” then populated the site with contents about the sport and that team until they let the domain expire in 2012. (Out of these three different curling oriented sites, the first one is the only one that still seems to be around but now of course on another domain.)</p>



<h2>Ads</h2>



<p>In early August 2012 the domain was registered to a new owner. I can’t remember why, but I missed the chance to get the domain then.</p>



<p>August 28 2012 marks the first date when curl.se is recorded to suddenly host a bunch of links to casino, bingo and gambling sites. It seems that whoever bought the domain wanted to surf on the good name and possible incoming links built up from the previous owners. For several years this crap was what the website showed. I doubt very many users ever were charmed by the content nor clicked on many links. It was ugly and over-packed with no real content but links and ads.</p>



<p>The last archive.org capture of the ad-filled site was done on October 2nd 2016. Since then, there’s been no web content on the domain that I’ve found. But the domain registration kept getting renewed.</p>



<h2>Failed to purchase</h2>



<p>In August 2019, I noticed that the domain was about to expire, and I figured it could be a sign that the owner was not too interested in keeping it anymore. I contacted the owner via a registrar and offered to buy it. The single only response I ever got was that my monetary offer was “too low”. I tried to up my bid, but I never got any further responses from the owner and then after a while I noticed that the domain registration was again renewed for another year. I went back to waiting.</p>



<h2>Expired again</h2>



<p>In September 2020 the domain was again up for expiration and I contacted the owner again, this time asking for a price for which they would be willing to sell the domain. Again no response, but this time the domain actually went all the way to expiry and deletion, which eventually made it available “on the market” for everyone interested to compete for the purchase.</p>



<p>I entered the race with the help of a registrar that would attempt to buy the name when it got released. When this happens, when a domain name is “released”, it becomes a race between all the potential buyers who want the domain. It is a 4-letter domain that is an English word and easy pronounceable. I knew there was a big risk others would also be trying to get it.</p>



<p>In the early morning of October 19th 2020, the curl.se domain was released and in the race of getting the purchase… I lost. Someone else got the domain before me. I was sad. For a while, until I got the good news…</p>



<h2>Donated!</h2>



<p>It turned out my friend <strong>Bartek Tatkowski</strong> had snatched the domain! After getting all the administrative things in order, Bartek graciously donated the domain to me and 15:00 on October 30 2020 I could enter my own name servers into the dedicated inputs fields for the domain, and configure it properly in our master and secondary DNS servers.</p>



<h2>curl.se is the new home</h2>



<p>Starting on November 4, 2020 <strong>curl.se is the new official home</strong> site for the curl project. The <code>curl.haxx.se</code> name will of course remain working for a long time more and I figure we can basically never shut it down as there are so many references to it spread out over the world. I intend to eventually provide redirects for most things from the old name to the new.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.fastly.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-1200x630.png" alt="" width="190" height="100" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-200x105.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-450x236.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px"></a></figure></div>



<p>What about a www prefix? The jury is still out how or if we should use that or not. The initial update of the site (November 4) uses a www.curl.se host name in links but I’ve not done any automatic redirects to or from that. As the site is CDNed, and we can’t use CNAMEs on the apex domain (curl.se), we instead use anycast IPs for it – the net difference to users should be zero. (Fastly is a generous sponsor of the curl project.)</p>



<p>I also happen to own <code>libcurl.se</code> since a few years back and I’ll make sure using this name also takes you to the right place.</p>



<h2>Why not curl.dev?</h2>



<p>People repeatedly ask me. Names in the .dev domains are <em>expensive</em>. Registering <code>curl.dev</code> goes for 400 USD right now. <code>curl.se</code> costs 10 USD/year. I see little to no reason to participate in that business and I don’t think spending donated money on such a venture is a responsible use of our funds.</p>

		<p>What do Microsoft <i>really</i> think about open-source?</p>

		<p><strong>Update</strong>: according to multiple online sources, the leaked source code was from GitHub <em>Enterprise</em>, not the version hosted at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>. While a substantial amount of code is shared between the two, they do have some differences.</p>
<p>The entirety of the confidential source code used by GitHub Enterprise has just been leaked to the public.</p>
<p>In a suspicious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104050026if_/https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/565ece486c7c1652754d7b6d2b5ed9cb4097f9d5">commit</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">official GitHub DMCA repository</a>, an unknown individual uploaded the confidential source code, impersonating Nat Friedman using a bug in GitHub's application.</p>
<p>At the heart of open-source, GitHub has long been criticised for keeping its source code private. The platform hosts millions of open-source projects, and critics say GitHub's position is somewhat hypocritical.</p>
<p>However, this raises questions around the security of GitHub's source code, and whether or not GitHub have anything to lose, if they do plan to release the source code in a public setting.</p>
<p>Some worry this will damage the overall security of GitHub, and this may be true. Commonly, closed-source applications perform "security by obscurity". This means the source code is hidden, with the intention of concealing security risks.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/17954714/microsoft-github-deal-acquisition-complete">acquisition of GitHub</a> in 2018, Microsoft have repeatedly emphasised their "love" for open-source. We have seen this through repeated commercial advertisements, which aim to place Microsoft at the forefront of open-source development.</p>
<p>Some users, such as Drew DeVault, suggest Microsoft is attempting to <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/27/Microsoft-plays-their-hand.html">centralise open-source</a>. Through closed-source applications, and proprietary extensions to Git, GitHub is seen as a platform that tries to <em>contain</em> open-source. An example of this is when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306674/github-down-errors-outage-june-2020">GitHub went offline for two hours</a>, leaving thousands of open-source projects inaccessible and unusable.</p>
<p>GitHub is, in many ways, the Google of open-source development.</p>
<p>Perhaps GitHub as 12 years late in finally revealing their source code to the public; and maybe this is just what we need. <a href="https://mastodon.tedomum.net/@resynth1943">What do you think?</a></p>

<![CDATA[IPv6 Is a Total Nightmare – This Is Why]]>

November 4, 2020 | https://teknikaldomain.me/post/ipv6-is-a-total-nightmare/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://teknikaldomain.me/post/ipv6-is-a-total-nightmare/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<div>


<p>So this is just going to be a total rant.
IPv6 is, in theory, a solution to many things, including the dwindling IPv4 address space.
IPv6 was a draft in 1997(!), and became a real <em>Internet Standard</em> in 2017.
And, quite frankly, it’s one of those things that just adds too much hassle for not enough benefit.</p>

<p>Okay, yes, IPv6’s address space is <em><strong>massive.</strong></em>
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for 4,294,967,296 total addresses.
IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, meaning… 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
The entire v4 space could fit into the v6 space $7.922816251426434 \times 10^{28}$ times over.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The default allocation to people, a <code>/64</code>, meaning the first half of the addresses is fixed and the entire second half is the part unique to the network, means that most people have 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 addresses to play with at home.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
Compared to v4, where <em>most</em> networks are around <code>/24</code>, meaning the first three groupings are fixed, you get… 254 addresses.
Again, context, a standard <code>/64</code> allocation can, <em>again</em>, fit the entire v4 address space inside itself 4,294,967,296 times. (Yes, that’s the number of addresses <em>in</em> the IPv4 address space. That’s what happens when you divide a power by half of that power.)</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are, well, sparse, given that most high-level authorities have already run out of addresses, but because CIDR and NAT are a thing, we’ve really started compacting down our usage.
<em>My entire house</em> of easily over 60 IPs takes up… 2, according to the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id="allocation-issues">Allocation Issues</h2>
<p>One thing that people have criticized IPv4 for is that the allocations are just horrible.
For example, <em>anything</em> starting with <code>127</code> is <code>localhost</code>.
normally this is <code>127.0.0.1</code>, but anything from <code>127.0.0.0</code> to <code>127.255.255.255</code> all mean the <strong>exact same thing.</strong>
That’s 16,777,216 addresses all <em>literally for <code>localhost</code>.</em>
By numbers, 0.39% of the address space, but just keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, anything starting with a <code>0</code>, is effectively “current network” (only valid as source), again, another 16 million addresses.</p>
<p>There’s also multiple blocks for private networks, <code>10.0.0.0/8</code>, <code>172.16.0.0/12</code>, and <code>192.168.0.0/16</code>.
In total, 17,891,328 addresses.</p>
<p>Compared to IPv6, yes, IPv6 is much better… in theory.
There’s only <em>one</em> loopback address, <code>::1</code>.
At the same time… <code>fc00::/7</code> (26,58,455,991,569,831,745,807,614,120,560,689,152 addresses) is the private address space (more on that later), <code>fe80::/10</code> (332,306,998,946,228,968,225,951,765,070,086,144 addresses) is the <em>local</em> address space, and <code>ff00::/8</code> (1,329,227,995,784,915,872,903,807,060,280,344,576 addresses.) is multicast.
yes, do you see a recurring pattern?
Even though the entire “special” address assignments are exactly 1.271% of the entire IPv6 address space, we’re still allocating <strong>giant</strong> swathes of addresses.
History repeats itself, you can see that <em>right here.</em></p>
<p>And I will admit, that multicast in IPv6 is special since some bits in the address are special flags, and one form of multicast actually includes a response node’s address, so it’s not <em>just</em> an arbitrary number, but… come on, that’s a little uncalled for, having <em>that much</em> space.</p>

<p>We all know what an IPv4 address looks like, right?
Four dotted-decimal grouping in the range from 0–255.
For example, <code>192.168.5.225</code>.
IPv6 uses <em>eight</em> groupings of four <em>hex</em> digits, colon-separated.
For example, <code>2607:f0d0:1002:0051:0000:0000:0000:0004</code>.
That’s… very unweildy, so we have a few shortening rules.
Any zeros that <em>lead</em> the droup can be dropped, giving us this: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51:0:0:0:4</code>.
And since <em>that</em> is still repetitive, you can replace <em>exactly one</em> sequence of <em>more than one group</em> of all zeros with an empty: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code>.
For the record this is why the loopback address is <code>::1</code>.
The full address is <code>0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</code>.
Even with those methods, they’re still <em>much</em> longer, harder to remember, and harder to even say than IPv4 addresses.</p>
<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p>And remember that this address violates the URL spec, since the <code>:</code> character is specifically to be used to separate the <em>host</em> portion (e.g., <code>google.com</code>) from the <em>port</em> to connect to (assuming nonstandard).
As an example, I can reach my torrent client via <code>http://192.168.5.43:9091</code>.
See that <code>:</code> there?
Because Transmission listens on port 9091, not port 80.
How do we fix this?
Well, by breaking it again, naturally.
To connect to a raw IPv6 address, you wrap it in square brackets.
To connect to <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code> directly, that’s <code>http://[2607:f0d0:1002:51::4]/</code>
<strong>Why is this a thing?!</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>okay, admittedly, IPv6 kinda relies on DNS since… just about everything uses DNS, and of course, actual names are more memorable than 32 hexadecimal digits, but DNS isn’t magic.
Unless you have your own DNS server (actually not that hard) that’s configured, you’re still manually typing addresses.
Of course if you have, say, pfSense managing your network, every static DHCP lease will be registered in DNS, but it has to take a DHCP lease.
And if this device doesn’t… well, I hope you don’t mind typing that out by hand to connect so you can configure it.</p>
<p>Even better, rDNS.
rDNS, or Reverse DNS, is where a DNS query is performed <em>with an IP address</em> that returns the hostname associated, in a <code>PTR</code> record.
For example, the IPv4 that <code>google.com</code> resolves to, <code>216.58.192.142</code>, can be queried as <code>142.192.58.216.in-addr.arpa</code> to get it’s “real” name, a <code>PTR</code> record for <code>ord36s01-in-f142.1e100.net</code>.
With <code>dig</code>, specifying a <code>-x</code> and then the IP will convert it to the correct format.
And if you look close, the query name is the IP, backwards, with <code>in-addr.arpa</code> at the front.
It’s backwards because of the hierarchical nature of DNS, which runs right to left, the opposite of IPs.
Of course, there’s also rDNS for IPv6:</p>

<p>One of the core pillars of IPv6 is that most of the processing of traffic should happen at the endpoints — routers don’t do much besides read, and forward, with very little actual data processing.
The IPv6 header while being <em>gargantuan</em> in comparison (because the giant addresses), is also much simpler.
A fixed version code (6), the traffic class (<abbr title="Differentiated Services">DiffServ</abbr>
+ <abbr title="Explicit Congestion Notification">ECN</abbr>
), a <em>flow label</em> which is effectively a random value that’s constant for every packet that’s part of the same logical connection, length, type of next header, and a TTL (then addresses, obviously).
That is <em>it</em>.
The IPv4 header contains 13 fields plus optional sections, and the IPv6 header contains a flat 8.
Of course, you may actually need other details, and that’s where the <em>next header</em> field comes in.
Instead of packing all sorts of options into the standard, global header, IPv6 uses additional header <em>extensions</em> that can get tacked on one after another to provide that information, say for fragmentation or IPsec.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
The value in the next header field identifies what’s going to come next, and the final header in the line will use this field to indicate the contained protocol, be it TCP, UDP, or something else.</p>
<p>Also note there’s no checksum anymore.
I mean, just about every device uses Ethernet, which has a Frame Check Sequence (FCS), UDP has a checksum option, TCP has a required checksum…
If we want to simply packet processing, drop the sum.
And really, it does make sense, in a way.
Even without that one, that means that most programs have two checksums: the Ethernet FCS as the frame gets transmitted point to point, and the transport layer checksum, making sure the entire packet is still valid.
Also, the IPv4 checksum also included the TTL (max number of hops in the path before the packet is dropped), meaning that at <em>every stop</em> along the way, the checksum had to be recalculated.</p>
<p>As a final point, this also does bring a change to another protocol: UDP.
With IPv4, the UDP checksum field can (and often would) be left blank as all zeros, meaning “no checksum”.
In IPv6, this is now disallowed, and a all zero checksum will still be checked… and then found invalid.
All UDP packets over IPv6 <em>must</em> have a valid checksum calculated.</p>

<p>So every link between devices has an MTU, the Maximum Transmission Unit.
For normal Ethernet links, minus the frame overhead, this is 1500 bytes.
If your equipment supports jumbo frames, that’s closer to 9000 bytes.
Well not all links are equal.
Some devices might have a high-MTU link on one end, and a lower MTU link on the other.
For example, my router might support jumbo frames internally, but the WAN side doesn’t allow that.
To deal with, this, we have <em>fragmentation</em>.</p>
<p>If a router is unable to forward a frame due to MTU differences, it will, if allowed, split the packet into multiple chunks, using the More Fragments flag and the Fragment Offset field of the IPv4 header, and send the packet in multiple frames piece by piece, which the other end can reassemble.
Note that I said “if allowed.”
There is a Don’t Fragment flag in the IPv4 header, and if this is set by the sending device, a router that cannot support a packet of that size will send back an <abbr title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</abbr>
“packet too big” message which bounces back along the chain.
Any node in the network path can perform this, meaning that for sending data, the only MTU you care about is the MTU of the device you’re directly connected …</p></div></article></div>

                <h3>Anatomy of a Binary Executable</h3>
                
                    <p><em></em>
                        <span>Wed, Nov 4, 2020</span>

            </div>

            <p>Even though I’ve developed software for a number of years now, there’s one question that has always been in the back of my mind and I haven’t had the time or patience to really answer, until now: <strong>What <em>is</em> a binary executable anyways?</strong></p>
<p>For this example, I wrote a brutally simple Rust program that includes a function “<code>sum</code>” to add two integers together, and am invoking it from <code>main()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, sum(<span>5</span>, <span>8</span>));
}

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>sum</span>(a: <span>i32</span>, b: <span>i32</span>) -&gt; <span>i32</span> {
    a <span>+</span> b
}
</code></pre></div><p>My Rust code is always structured the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html">“cargo way”</a>, so I can compile my program by running <code>cargo build</code>, and this will produce a binary for me within the <code>target/debug/</code> directory. I have named my crate <code>rbin</code>, so this is the name of the binary that is created at this location:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ cargo build
   Compiling rbin v0.1.0 <span>(</span>/home/mierdin/Code/rbin<span>)</span>
    Finished dev <span>[</span>unoptimized + debuginfo<span>]</span> target<span>(</span>s<span>)</span> in 0.15s

~$ ls -lha target/debug/rbin
-rwxrwxr-x <span>2</span> mierdin mierdin 3.1M Nov  <span>3</span> 22:46 target/debug/rbin
</code></pre></div><p>These days, it’s really easy to take such questions for granted, but if you’re curious, you may be asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But what <strong>is</strong> that file?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean we all generally know that it’s an “executable”, in that we run it and our program happens. But what does that mean? What is contained in that file that means our computer automatically just <strong>knows</strong> how to run it? And how is it possible that a program with 7 lines of code can take up over 3 megabytes of disk space?!?</p>
<p>It turns out that in order to create an executable for this ridiculously simple program, the Rust compiler must include quite a bit of additional software to make it possible.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out there is a widely accepted format for these things, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">“Executable and Linkable Format”</a>, or ELF!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that I won’t be comprehensively covering ELF here (there are plenty of other resources, many of which I’ll link to) - rather this is an exploration of what goes into a Rust binary with the simplest, default settings, and some observations about what seems interesting to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ELF is a well-known, popular format, especially in the world of Linux, but there are plenty of others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_executable_file_formats">Operating systems like Windows and macOS each have their own format</a>, which is a big reason why, when you’re compiling (or simply downloading) software, you have to specify the operating system you want to run it on. This is true despite the fact that the underlying machine code that executes your program may be the same on all of them (e.g. <code>x86_64</code>).</p>
<p>An <strong>exceptional</strong> visual breaking down the ELF format can be found at the link to the ELF wikipedia page above, I have found myself constantly referring back to it while writing this post:</p>
<p><a title="Ange Albertini / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0)" href="https://oswalt.dev/assets/2020/11/elf.png"><img width="512" alt="ELF Executable and Linkable Format diagram by Ange Albertini" src="https://oswalt.dev/assets/2020/11/elf.png"></a>
</p>
<p>Commonly, executable formats like this specify a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number">magic number</a> right at the beginning of the file, so that the format can be easily identified. This occupies the first four bytes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>. This is a very important field, because unless we can first identify an ELF file appropriately, we can’t reasonably expect to do anything “ELF-y” with it. We know where certain bits of information <strong>should</strong> be in an ELF file, but we first must identify using these bytes that this is what we can expect.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility is extremely useful for printing all kinds of useful metadata and related tables of information contained within an ELF file. However, this utility expects - naturally - that the file being read is actually an ELF file, and even provides a helpful hint that the expected “magic bytes” for a non-ELF file aren’t set appropriately when used on a non-ELF file, so it doesn’t attempt to read the rest:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l .gitignore

readelf: Error: Not an ELF file - it has the wrong magic bytes at the start
</code></pre></div><p>Once identified, the entire rest of the file can be identified using <strong>byte offsets</strong> (that is, the number of bytes from zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those that are accustomed to looking at network packet captures, this should all sound very familiar to you, as this is exactly how we know where certain fields are located in a packet header. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">Ethernet frames</a> have a predictable preamble and start-of-frame delimiter. Ethernet also has a field called the “Ethertype”, which provides a clue as to what protocol is contained within the Ethernet frame (which allows computers to then parse those field as well). Just like Ethernet has a standard set of byte offsets that indicate where the various fields should be represented, the ELF format specifies its own offsets for all of the fields providing useful identifying and execution information in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>, which then point to other important locations within the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s all kinds of useful information in this header, but in particular, the <code>e_entry</code> field  in the file header points to the offset location from where the execution should start. This is the “entry point” for the program. We’ll definitely be following this down the rabbit hole in a little bit.</p>
<p>We can again use <code>readelf</code>, this time on a proper ELF file (our Rust program), and also using the <code>-h</code> flag to show the file header:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -h target/debug/rbin

ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f <span>45</span> 4c <span>46</span> <span>02</span> <span>01</span> <span>01</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span>

  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       <span>0</span>
  Type:                              DYN <span>(</span>Shared object file<span>)</span>
  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x5070
  Start of program headers:          <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Start of section headers:          <span>3195368</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Size of program headers:           <span>56</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of program headers:         <span>12</span>
  Size of section headers:           <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of section headers:         <span>42</span>
  Section header string table index: <span>41</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, the “magic number” lets us parse at least the rest of the file header, which contains not only information about the file, but byte-offset locations for other important portions of the file. One of these is the “Start of program headers”, which starts after 64 bytes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#Program_header">program header table</a> contains information that allows the operating system to allocate memory and load the program. This is also referred to as a <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue23/flower/psimage.html">process image</a>. You can think of it as a list of “instructions” that tell the system to do various things with chunks of memory in order to prepare to execute this program.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility also allows us to read the program headers using the <code>-l</code> flag:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l target/debug/rbin

Elf file type is DYN <span>(</span>Shared object file<span>)</span>

									<p>I have just published the first Roam-native book, or “rBook” for short. Its title is <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/ergodicity"><em>Ergodicity</em></a>, and in addition to the traditional ebook formats of pdf, ePub and mobi, it is also available in Roam json format.</p>
<p>I did it because I enjoy exploring new ideas non-linearly on the internet, and I wanted to do the same with books. Readers should be able to jump between concepts, go deep on what interests them, and skim through the rest. They should be able to take notes, and their notes should become an organic part of the text.</p>
<p>I knew that books could be more. I just didn’t know how. Until recently, there wasn’t a technology that made it possible. Then came Roam Research. I remember that, within the first ten minutes of using it, I realized that it was what I’ve been looking for.</p>
<p>rBooks are very different from just copying and pasting the text of a book into Roam. They still have a table of contents with the usual structure in numbered chapters, but they can do much more.</p>
<p>First of all, most of their information is contained in pages describing concepts. The relevant blocks are then embedded in chapter pages. You still get a “linear story,” but you can break free from it at any point. You can explore the current topic deeper, and from there, jump to related topics, following your interests.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_ergodicity.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_ergodicity-1013x1024.png" alt="" width="1013" height="1024" srcset="https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_ergodicity-1013x1024.png 1013w, https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_ergodicity-594x600.png 594w, https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_ergodicity-1080x1092.png 1080w, https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_ergodicity-45x45.png 45w, https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_ergodicity.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px"></a></p>
<p>As another advantage, you have the option to import the book into your own Roam graph. For decades we thought of books as “downloading information into your brain,” but never before the metaphor has been so literal. Because information in a rBook is structured into concept pages, it can neatly integrate into your pre-existing graph, keeping all the connections within the book and eventually linking to information pre-existing in your graph. Moreover, if you already have notes on the same topic, the information from the book will automatically append itself to them.</p>
<p>As a third advantage, examples and thought experiments are all tagged by topic (e.g., #example-business) so that you can quickly discover how a topic can apply to a particular field.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_examples.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_examples.png" alt="" width="750" height="255" srcset="https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_examples.png 750w, https://www.roambrain.com/wp-content/uploads/luca_dellanna_examples-700x238.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></a></p>
<p>These are just three of the many innovative features of rBooks. I can only wonder with amazement about the possibilities that Roam-native books offer over traditional eBooks. This is the current frontier of learning, and we are the pioneers.</p>
<p>I’ve already published 6 books, but I’ve never been this excited to release a new one. I hope you’ll all enjoy it. (<a href="https://gumroad.com/l/ergodicity">It’s here</a>.)</p>

    <p>You have a database of notes and you want to build a system that intelligently assignes tags to the notes. For example, you write a note like this:</p>
<div><pre>I found out today that
  we're going to have a baby!
  I am really excited.
</pre></div>
<p>And the system autosuggests adding <code>#life</code> and <code>#baby</code>.</p>
<p>One easy way to do this is through the so-called Bayes’ theorem. By the end of this article, you’ll know what that is and how to use it.</p>
<p>But before we get there, let’s first make sure you’re really expecting that baby! (I promise this is going to be relevant.)</p>
<h2><a href="#probability-of-babies" name="probability-of-babies"><small>15 . 1</small> Probability of babies</a></h2>
<p>Pregnancy tests aren’t perfect. They can tell you you’re expecting when you’re not, and they can tell you you’re not expecting when you are. In other words, they can be wrong in two ways: there can be <em>false positives</em> (test says yes, but it’s incorrect) and there can be <em>false negatives</em> (test says no, but it’s incorrect).</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Test says YES</th><th>Test says NO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Actual baby</td><td>👶</td><td>True positive</td><td>False negative</td></tr><tr><td>No baby</td><td>◯</td><td>False positive</td><td>True negative</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Although they’re not perfect, pregancy tests still do have value, of course. They are <em>mostly</em> correct. Let’s say they correctly identify a pregnancy 93% of the time, and correctly identify non-pregnancy 95% of the time.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Test says YES</th><th>Test says NO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Actual baby</td><td>👶</td><td>93%</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>No baby</td><td>◯</td><td>5%</td><td>95%</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>So, if you (or your partner) come out of the bathroom with a test result that says YES, what is the probability that you’re really having a baby?</p>
<p>You may be tempted to blurt out 93%. But not so fast.</p>
<h2><a href="#prevalence-of-babies" name="prevalence-of-babies"><small>15 . 2</small> Prevalence of babies</a></h2>
<p>Forget the quality of the test for a moment. What is the probability that, when you’re taking a pregnancy test, you’re actually pregnant? Note that we’re not talking about the precision of any device here. We’re talking about how likely it is you’re pregnant, in reality, as you’re entering the bathroom with the little testing device in your hand.</p>
<p>Now, look, I can’t find any good data on this, so I’ll just go ahead and estimate. My guess is that only 10% of the women who decide to take a pregnancy test are pregnant at the time.</p>

<p>To find the probabilities of the four different outcomes (true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative) among all the women who take a pregnancy test, we just need to multiply:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Test says YES</th><th>Test says NO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Actual baby (10%)</td><td>👶</td><td>93%&nbsp;⨯&nbsp;10%&nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>9.3%</strong></td><td>7%&nbsp;⨯&nbsp;10%&nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>0.7%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>No baby (90%)</td><td>◯</td><td>5%&nbsp;⨯&nbsp;90%&nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>4.5%</strong></td><td>95%&nbsp;⨯&nbsp;90%&nbsp;=&nbsp;<strong>85.5%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>It might not be immediately obvious, but the four numbers in bold add up to 100%. That makes sense: if you’re taking a pregnancy test, you will obviously fall into one of these four categories.</p>
<p>Note the difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a 93% probability that—<em>given that you are having a baby</em>—the test says YES. This is about the quality of the test.</li>
<li>There is a 9.3% probability that a random test-taking woman has a baby <em>and</em> her test says YES. This is about one of the four different outcomes of pregnancy test-taking.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first probability is higher because it talks about women who we know to be pregnant. The second probability is lower because it talks about any test-taking woman.</p>
<h2><a href="#total-probability" name="total-probability"><small>15 . 3</small> Total probability</a></h2>
<p>So, once again, if you come out of the bathroom with a test result that says YES, what is the probability that you’re really having a baby?</p>

<p>I’ll repeat the table from above here, except now it doesn’t show percentages, and instead shows whole numbers. All I did was multiply the percentages by 1000, so that instead of looking at fractions, you can imagine four groups of women. I think it makes things a bit more intuitive.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th>Test says YES</th><th>Test says NO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Actual baby</td><td>👶</td><td>93</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>No baby</td><td>◯</td><td>45</td><td>855</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>If you want, you can try to figure it out yourself now. The question, once again, is: “Given that your test result says YES, what is the probability that you’re really having a baby?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> We take the group of women with a YES. That is to say, the 93 women with the true positive test, and the 45 women with the false positive test. That’s 138 women.</p>
<p>Out of these 138 women, only 93 are actually having a baby. That is to say, 93 out of 138 really are pregnant.</p>
<p>93 divided by 138 is about 67%. That is to say, holding a test result that says YES, the probability you’re really pregnant is only 67%.</p>

<h2><a href="#congrats" name="congrats"><small>15 . 4</small> Congrats!</a></h2>
<p><del>It’s a girl!</del> You just gained an intuitive understanding of Bayes’ theorem. It’s a way to convert results of a test (e.g. pregnancy strip) into the real probability of an event (e.g. pregnancy).</p>
<p>Here’s the mathematical formula:</p>
<p><img src="https://selfimproving.dev/images/bayes-pregnancy.svg" alt="{\displaystyle P(A|B)={\frac {P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)+P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)}}}"></p><!-- 
  * LaTex: {\displaystyle P(A|B)={\frac {P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)+P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)}}}
  * converted with https://viereck.ch/latex-to-svg/
  * edited in Sketch
-->
<p>You can read it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability that event A occurs given event B<br>
is equal to</li>
<li>the numerator, which is:
<ul>
<li>the probability that event B occurs given event A<br>
times</li>
<li>the probability that event A occurs  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>divided by the denominator, which is:
<ul>
<li>the probability that event B occurs given event A<br>
times</li>
<li>the probability that event A occurs<br>
plus</li>
<li>the probability that event B occurs given A <em>didn’t</em> occur<br>
times</li>
<li>the probability that event A <em>didn’t</em> occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now replace <code>B</code> with “pregnancy test says YES” and <code>A</code> with “you’re pregnant”.</p><!-- TODO: add the formula with annotations, e.g. P(A) is "probability a test-taking woman is pregnant" -->
<h2><a href="#the-name" name="the-name"><small>15 . 5</small> The name</a></h2>
<p>The theorem is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, an English Presbyterian minister. His work was published in 1763, so this math is well over 250 years old.</p>
<p><img src="https://selfimproving.dev/images/Thomas_Bayes.jpg" alt="Thomas Bayes"></p>

<p>When we hear “Bayes” these days, it’s either because of the theorem above, or because of a related idea of Bayesian probability. In this approach, probabilities aren’t just frequencies (e.g. “how many people are over 60 years old?”) but can also be strengths of beliefs (e.g. “how much do I believe we’ll finish the project in time?”).</p>
<h2><a href="#automatic-tagging" name="automatic-tagging"><small>15 . 6</small> Automatic tagging</a></h2>
<p>Which brings us back to our original problem. We have a note-taking app with 1000 notes that are already tagged by the user. We want a system that automatically suggests tags (like <code>#baby</code>) for new notes based on what’s written in them (like <code>"Bought a crib today!"</code>). </p>
<p>We’ll take words in the text, and we’ll use Bayes to see how probable it is that, given those words, a tag applies. For example, when there’s <code>"crib"</code> in the text, how probable is it that the tag <code>#baby</code> applies?</p><table><thead><tr><th>Test</th><th></th><th>Real event</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pregnancy test says YES</td><td>?→</td><td>Pregnancy</td></tr><tr><td>One of the words in the text is <code>"crib"</code></td><td>?→</td><td>Tag <code>#baby</code> applies</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- TODO: rebuilt into a drawing with arrows, so that it doesn't look like a table -->
<p>It might not seem like it at first but this is essentially the same problem as above. We have a test, and we want to see how indicative it is of a real event.</p>
<p>Once again, if you’re up for it, you can try to figure it out yourself. Try to apply Bayes’ theorem to solve auto-tagging. To scope this down, don’t try to solve the whole algorithm at once. Just try to figure out a single pair of word &amp; tag. In other words, find out what’s the probability of the tag <code>#baby</code> given the word <code>"crib"</code> in the text. You might want to write things down.</p>
<p>If you’re up for it, stop reading now and go figure it out.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> We want to find the probability that a note should be tagged with <code>#baby</code> <em>given that</em> it contains the word <code>"crib"</code>. That’s our <em>P(A|B)</em>. Then, using the formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability that a note is tagged with <code>#baby</code> <em>given that</em> it contains the word <code>"crib"</code><br>
is equal to</li>
<li>the numerator, which is:
<ul>
<li>the probability that a note contains the word <code>"crib"</code>  <em>given that</em> it’s tagged with <code>#baby</code><br>
times</li>
<li>the probability that a note is tagged with <code>#baby</code>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>divided by the denominator, which is:
<ul>
<li>the probability that a note contains the word <code>"crib"</code> <em>given that</em> it’s tagged with <code>#baby</code><br>
times</li>
<li>the probability that a note is tagged with <code>#baby</code><br>
plus</li>
<li>the probability that a note contains the word <code>"crib"</code> given that it’s <em>not</em> tagged with <code>#baby</code><br>
times</li>
<li>the probability that a note is <em>not</em> tagged with <code>#baby</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><!-- TODO: replace with an annotation of the formula -->
<p>In a note-taking app, we know all those values on the right side of the equation. </p>

<p>Actually, there is one other reasons to read the code: to find the divide-by-zero bug that we’d need to deal with in a real project. I’ll leave that as an exercise to you. Where could the code break and how would you prevent that?</p>
<p>Putting aside trivialities such as division by zero, we’re done. Using this code, we can look at words in a new note and compute the probability that the note should be tagged with a particular tag.</p>

Most of the participants showed improvement, and half achieved remission at the four-week follow-up.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin" target="_blank">Psilocybin</a> is a compound found in so-called “magic mushrooms.” It produces visual and auditory hallucinations, and profound changes in consciousness, over a period of several hours.</p><p>The findings appeared on November 4 in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JAMA Psychiatry</a></em>.</p><h2>Effect of psilocybin 4x stronger than traditional antidepressants</h2><p>“The magnitude of the effect we saw was about four times larger than what clinical trials have shown for traditional antidepressants on the market,” said co-author <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/davis">Alan Davis</a> of Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>As the paper explains, “the effect sizes reported in this study were approximately 2.5 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychotherapy, and more than 4 times greater than the effect sizes found in psycho-pharmacological depression treatment studies.”</p><p>“Because most other depression treatments take weeks or months to work and may have undesirable effects, this could be a game changer if these findings hold up” in future clinical trials, Davis said.</p><p>And compared to traditional antidepressants, the side effects of psilocybin are more limited. These include mild-to-moderate headaches, and “challenging emotions” during the sessions. Antidepressant medications, on the other hand, have more far-reaching side effects. These include <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/new-study-finds-ethnic-variation-in-suicide-method-guns-vs-hanging/">suicidal</a> ideation, decrease in sexual drive, and weight gain.</p><p>Furthermore, the effectiveness of psilocybin <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/effects-of-therapy-for-hypochondriacs-last-10-years-or-more/">therapy</a> appears after only one or two administrations. This represents another advantage over commonly used antidepressants, which typically require daily administration.</p><h2>Two five-hour psilocybin sessions</h2><p>For the new study, the researchers recruited 24 people with a long-term history of depression. Most of the participants had experienced symptoms for about two years before enrolling in the study.</p><p>The participants underwent two five-hour psilocybin sessions, under the supervision of the researchers.</p><p>The average age of participants was 39. Sixteen were women. Twenty-two identified as white, one identified as Asian, and one identified as African American.</p><p>Participants had to taper off any antidepressants prior to the study. They did so with the help of their personal physician, to ensure safe exposure to this experimental treatment.</p><p>Treatment consisted of two psilocybin doses given by two monitors who provided guidance and reassurance. The doses were given two weeks apart, between August 2017 and April 2019. Each treatment session lasted about five hours. The participants lay on a couch wearing eyeshades and headphones that played music, in the presence of the monitors.</p><h2>A very large reduction in depressive symptoms</h2><p>All participants completed the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18408526/" target="_blank">GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</a> upon enrollment. They also did this same assessment at one and four weeks following completion of their treatment.</p><p>A score of 24 or more indicates severe depression. A score of 17-23 means moderate depression, 8-16 mild depression, and 7 or less no depression.</p><p>At enrollment, participants had an average depression scale rating of 23. But at one week and four weeks after treatment, they had an average depression scale score of 8.</p><p>After treatment, most participants showed a substantial decrease in their symptoms. Likewise, almost half were in remission from depression at the four-week follow-up.</p><p>For the entire group of 24 participants, 67% showed a more than 50% reduction in depression symptoms at the one-week follow-up, and 71% at the four-week follow-up. Overall, four weeks post-treatment, 54% of participants were considered in remission, meaning they no longer qualified as being depressed.</p><p>Compared to ketamine, another psychoactive substance that has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25038867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently been found</a> to alleviate depression, psilocybin has several advantages. The antidepressant effects of psilocybin seem to last longer. Psilocybin also has a lower potential for addiction and adverse events than ketamine.</p><h2>More results to follow</h2><p>The researchers say they will follow the participants for a year after the study to see how long the antidepressant effects of the psilocybin treatment last. They will report these new findings in a later publication.</p><p>In 2016, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers first reported that treatment with psilocybin under psychologically supported conditions significantly relieved existential anxiety and depression in people with a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hallucinogenic_drug_psilocybin_eases_existential_anxiety_in_people_with_life_threatening_cancer_" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-threatening cancer diagnosis</a>.</p><p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 17 million people in the U.S., and 300 million people worldwide, have experienced major <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/category/mental-health/depression/" target="_blank">depression</a>.</p><p>Entrepreneur and philanthropist <a href="https://tim.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Ferriss</a> supported the funding campaign for this study. “I believe this study to be a critically important proof of concept for the medical approval of psilocybin for treatment of depression, a condition I have personally struggled with for decades,” he said.</p><p>“How do we explain the incredible magnitude and durability of effects? Treatment research with moderate to high doses of psychedelics may uncover entirely new paradigms for understanding and improving mood and mind,” Ferriss said.</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.3285?guestAccessKey=29ac3052-6203-4fb4-b1e2-d9dda5988445&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=110420" target="_blank">Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial</a>“<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan K.

<p>During this pandemic, scheduling a meeting has become more important than ever, be it for a conference call, a consultation, or just a friendly chat.</p><p>In this guide, we'll explore how to use Google Calendar's API to make your own <strong>calendar booking app </strong>(yes, it's a platform, so other people can log in and share their own calendar link!). </p><figure><img src="https://blog.cotter.app/content/images/2020/11/calendar.gif"><figcaption>Build a Calendar Booking App with Cotter, Cloudflare Workers, and Google API</figcaption></figure><h3 id="try-out-the-live-demo-">Try out the live demo!</h3><figure><a href="https://cottercalendar.herokuapp.com/"><div><p>Calendar Booking App by Cotter</p><p>Calendar Booking App by Cotter</p><p><img src="https://cottercalendar.herokuapp.com/cottercalendar200.png"></p></div></a></figure><h3 id="we-ll-use-">We'll use:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.cotter.app/">Cotter</a> for logging in users and connecting to their Google Account.</li><li><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a> as a backend that will call Google Calendar API.</li><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference">Google Calendar API</a> for booking time slots in your users' calendar.</li><li>We'll also use React in this tutorial.</li></ul><figure><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/"><div><p>Cloudflare Workers®</p><p>Build your next application with Cloudflare Workers</p><p><img src="https://workers.cloudflare.com/favicon.ico"><span>Workers logo</span></p></div><p><img src="https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/215130914/0a128400-41f5-11ea-8dc8-b1c09a48fa06"></p></a></figure><p><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare workers</a> allows you to deploy JavaScript code on Cloudflare's Edge network. This means you can write serverless code in Cloudflare workers and have it deployed across the globe. Your users will connect to the nearest Cloudflare network.</p><h3 id="what-about-a-database">What about a database?</h3><p>Cloudflare workers offers a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/">Key-Value store</a> that can keep consistent data across their locations. Note that currently, it's "eventually consistent" which means it might take some time (max 60s) for an update to be available globally.</p><h3 id="why-do-we-need-a-backend">Why do we need a backend?</h3><p>The biggest reason why we need a backend in this tutorial is that<strong><strong> we need a secure environment to store our API Secret Key</strong></strong> which is used to get Google's Access Tokens from Cotter.</p><p><strong>We don't need a database or a key-value store for our use case, </strong>so Cloudflare Workers is perfect for deploying a simple backend code that authenticates your users and calls Google's API</p><p>To try it out right now, you can use our CodeSandbox and follow the steps below to set up the Cloudflare Backend:</p><p><strong>1. Create a project at <a href="https://dev.cotter.app/">Cotter</a>, then add Sign in with Google to your Login Form</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/google-instructions">Follow these instructions to set up Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials and connect it to Cotter</a>. </li><li>Make sure you added <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar</code> for the scope.</li><li>Enable Google for your form: Go to Branding &gt; Magic Link Form &gt; click the checkmark to enable <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider#setting-up-social-login-provider">Google Sign In</a></li><li>Add Cotter's Login Form to your website</li></ul><p><strong>2. Use this <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/cotter-calendar-bs7qb?file=/src/constants.js">CodeSandbox</a> to get the calendar-booking React App. </strong>Update <code>src/constants.js</code> with your Cotter API KEY ID. You can also clone the project from the <a href="https://github.com/cotter-code/calendar-booker">Github Repo</a>.</p><p><strong>3. Setup Cloudflare Worker, make 3 workers with subdomains:</strong></p><ul><li><code>checkconnection.YOURSUBDOMAIN.workers.dev</code></li><li><code>createevent.YOURSUBDOMAIN.workers.dev</code></li><li><code>disconnect.YOURSUBDOMAIN.workers.dev</code></li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/cotter-code/calendar-booker/tree/main/cloudflare">Copy the code from our Github for your Cloudflare Worker</a>.</p><p><strong>4. Enable Google Calendar API in your Google project</strong></p><p>Enable <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/calendar-json.googleapis.com">Google Calendar API</a> to the project that you used to create Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cotter.app/content/images/2020/11/Diagram.png"></figure><p>Here's the outline of the things that we needed to do to build this platform:</p><ul><li>Users will be using "Sign in with Google" to get an access token from Google. This access token is accessible via <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/getting-access-tokens-from-social-login-providers">Cotter's API</a>.</li><li>Make API endpoints at your Cloudflare Worker which would 1) call <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/getting-access-tokens-from-social-login-providers">Cotter's API</a> to get the user's Google Access Token, and 2) call Google's API using that Google access token.</li></ul><hr><figure><img src="https://blog.cotter.app/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png"></figure><h2 id="getting-google-s-access-token-via-google-sign-in">Getting Google's Access Token via Google Sign In</h2><p>To access Google's Calendar API, you'll need a Google Access Token for the user to modify their calendar. This means the user needs to connect their Google Account. Using Cotter as your authentication service, this can be done in 2 ways:</p><ul><li><strong>If the user logged-in using Google Sign In</strong>, you can automatically access their Google Access Token by calling <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/getting-access-tokens-from-social-login-providers">Cotter's API</a>.</li><li><strong>If the user logged-in with their email</strong>, you can provide a button on the dashboard and <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider#connecting-a-social-account-to-an-existing-user">ask them to connect their Google Account</a>. After that, you can access their Google Access Token by calling <a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/getting-access-tokens-from-social-login-providers">Cotter's API</a>.</li></ul><blockquote>When your user logged-in using Cotter, you'll get a <strong>Cotter Access Token</strong>. We'll use this access token to<strong> protect our API Endpoints</strong> that we're going to make in Cloudflare Workers.</blockquote><p><strong>1) Adding Sign in with Google to your Login Form</strong></p><ol><li><a href="https://docs.cotter.app/sdk-reference/web/sign-in-with-social-login-provider/google-instructions">Follow these instructions to set up Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials and connect it to Cotter</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<div>
	<p>2 Years ago I read about how Clearbit and "G" formerly head of growth at Segment famously wrote an article how Segment build a $10,000+ pipeline daily using expensive and complex API's. At that time it was complicated, out of reach for most and yes almost impossible to deliver. Simply what they achieved is noteworthy but &nbsp;impossible for most companies. In the end it’s incredibly powerful and exciting, people struggled understanding how it works and how they could wire it together themselves.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It’s hard. It involves connecting client-side and server-side data across five or six APIs (depending how you configure it) in a reliable way, engineers and lot of cost.</p><p>Saleshub has build it out of the box as the first company on the market, and making this strategy available to you today!</p><h3 id="backstory-what-did-they-try-to-achieve">Backstory what did they try to achieve?</h3><p>With outbound emails, sales development reps have a clear trade off between spending more time personalizing their messages vs. sending more messages. Either way, their goal is to set meetings for account executives to convert to an opportunity.</p><p>At Saleshub, we’ve experimented with timely outreach, tracking high email engagement and topical social mentions to cue in our sales team. Though it works, it’s hard to get a reliable source of data connected together, so it’s hard to scale.</p><p>But, there’s one reliable source of abundant data - website visitors. <strong><em><em>What better time to follow up after they’ve visited your website</em></em>?</strong></p><h3 id="how-do-you-follow-up-with-website-visitors">How do you follow up with website visitors?</h3><p>If we look at a traditional SaaS company, most of them have found it impossible to follow up with website visitors - even if they were really engaged - without pixels, form fills, and the constraints of ad platforms, form conversion rates, and so on.</p><p>This all pans out in, we know we have visitors but who is really visiting? We don’t know who they are from the data that we’ve got. We don’t have a key to unlocking the data.</p><p>This is where the <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-address">IP address</a> comes in.</p><blockquote><strong><strong>IP addresses can be either static or dynamic. Static IP addresses never change</strong>, they are always the same<strong>. They serve as a permanent Internet address and provides a simple and reliable way for remote computers to contact you. Static IP addresses reveal such information as the continent, country, region, and city in which a computer is located</strong> and when using Saleshub we can identify the company behind the static IP.</strong></blockquote><p>An IP address is akin to a physical, street address for your computer.</p><p>In the B2C space, people move houses and street addresses aren’t always the most up-to-date source (we’ve all received someone else mail). IP addresses aren’t so useful for matching here either.</p><p>With businesses, there’s a much stronger “footprint” with more activity to and from that address. It’s much easier to associate an IP address with a company. This is where Saleshub and <a href="https://exactvisitor.com/">ExactVisitor.com</a> comes in.</p><figure><img src="https://saleshub.ai/blog/content/images/2020/11/Image-2020-11-04-at-15.20.04.png" alt="" srcset="https://saleshub.ai/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Image-2020-11-04-at-15.20.04.png 600w, https://saleshub.ai/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Image-2020-11-04-at-15.20.04.png 1000w, https://saleshub.ai/blog/content/images/2020/11/Image-2020-11-04-at-15.20.04.png 1514w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Saleshub have matched up IP addresses with company names. Saleshub is using ExactVisitor to make this available inside the platform. You give an IP address, and it returns a company name.</p><p><em><em>This gives us the “key” to unlock all this data</em></em>.</p><p>With a company name, we can discover all sorts of information like their industry, their employees, their revenues, and more.</p><p>And the same principle to individual contacts. If we know an employee, we can discover their email address, their job title etc.</p><p>The automations when they kick can then automatically prospect the right person on LinkedIn, automate the outreach and let you contact the right decision makers from the visiting company.</p><p>Saleshub also integrates with Techtracker.io to further provide more data to accurately target the right visitors, based on their technology usage.</p><p>Once you setup your criteria's Saleshub can live determine if this is a fit or not.</p><figure><img src="https://saleshub.ai/blog/content/images/2020/11/Image-2020-11-04-at-19.01.25.png" alt="" srcset="https://saleshub.ai/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Image-2020-11-04-at-19.01.25.png 600w, https://saleshub.ai/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Image-2020-11-04-at-19.01.25.png 1000w, https://saleshub.ai/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Image-2020-11-04-at-19.01.25.png 1600w, https://saleshub.ai/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Image-2020-11-04-at-19.01.25.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Saleshub is using the data from the IP to turn it into actionable data:</p><blockquote>- Company Name<br>- Company Technology usage (matching if a fit)<br>- Company Size<br>- Company Industry<br>- Company employee range<br>- Visitor location to target the right employees</blockquote><div><p>Now it will qualify based on your criteria's if this is a fit or not. If a fit 5 min after the visit it will take your personas and prospect them on Linkedin and follow your automation.</p><p><strong>Five ways Saleshub can take this even further:</strong></p></div><p>If you’ve gone to all the effort of prospecting for anonymous visitors, and everything else there’s so many other related automations and strategies you can apply.</p><p><strong>Here’s five ideas…</strong></p><h4 id="1-write-revealed-prospects-as-leads-and-contacts-in-salesforce">1. Write “revealed” prospects as leads and contacts in Salesforce</h4><p>To keep your sales team in the loop, make sure their CRM is updated with leads who are being auto-emailed. It’s important to keep teams aligned, especially with very scalable, automated processes.</p><p>Write a Lead Source as <code>Anonymous Revealed by Saleshub</code> &nbsp;and use this to power other logic. This also clues in your sales guys with the “we noticed a lot of people from your company on the site recently…” opener.</p><h4 id="2-trigger-10x-personalized-emails-">2. Trigger 10X personalized emails.</h4><p>This outbound email recipe is entirely automated, but for certain segments (perhaps large companies, or specific titles?), you may still want to run manual outreach emails and personalize each message further.</p><p>At Saleshub, we first tested these outbound email campaigns with manual outreach. This is the example of an email that gets a meeting…</p><p><em><em><strong>can see you're interested in </strong></em><strong>Saleshub</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em><strong>ai</strong><em><strong>...</strong></em></em></p><p><em><em>Hi </em>Christina<em>,</em></em></p><p><em><em>From one data geek to another, you can understand that I track all my emails and web analytics</em></em>...</p><p><em><em>And I see several dozen folks from </em>Amazon Web Services<em> have been visiting </em>Saleshub<em>.</em>ai<em>, checking out our live customer use cases and reading about our </em>automations</em>.</p><p><em><em>If you're interested, I'd love to talk - to share what companies like </em>Speexx<em>, </em>Acronis<em>, </em>Accenture<em> and others are using </em>Saleshub<em> to do, and how we can best help you at </em>Amazon Web Services<em>. In particular, upgrading your </em>automations to save your sales team countless of hours orchestrating their outreach on Linkedin + Emails.</em></p><p><em><em>If you've got 15 minutes to talk, I'd love to schedule some time</em></em>?</p><p><em><em>Look forward to hearing from you </em>Christina</em>,</p><p><em>Jesper</em></p><p><em>Saleshub<em>.</em>ai</em></p><h4 id="3-10x-retargeting-ads">3. 10X Retargeting ads</h4><p>Traditional, pixel-based retargeting only retargets the website visitor. As well as enrolling all these anonymous revealed prospects in outbound sales campaigns, enroll them in ad audiences too so you can go multi-channel. That can be done by creating custom audiences inside Facebook.</p><p>Ad audiences can suffer delivery issues by being too small. Bulking out your audiences with prospects from the same company can help solve this too.</p><h4 id="4-create-a-personalized-website-variation">4. Create a personalized website variation</h4><p>Now you know their name, and you know things about their company, we can consider creating a variation of the website for their company we recommend using ExactVisitor's visitor.js to use with Google Optimize.</p><h4 id="5-notify-your-team-on-slack">5. Notify your team on Slack</h4><p>Slack notifications aren’t the favorite method for many sales teams we speak too (including our own!), but Slack can bring data to your whole team very quickly and easily.</p><p>For marketing teams, this can be a quick hack to excite and motivate other teams who might have missed you had Google, Uber, and Tesla all over your site this week! 😉</p><p>Use visitor Alerts and your team knows when high targeted prospects are visiting. Setting up an <strong>#interesting_web_visitors</strong> channel is one of many ideas, as well as <strong>#demo_requests</strong>, <strong>#new_stripe_subscriptions</strong>, and more.</p>

<p>I read a post called <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html">The Tail End</a> by Tim Urban yesterday. Tim talks about how, if he lives to be 90, then he has about 56 Super Bowls left to watch, 300 books left to read, or 20 more Red Sox games to watch in person.</p>



<p>Then he gets into the scary stuff. What about the things that he did more of when he was a kid, like spending time with his parents?</p>



<blockquote><p>It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.</p><cite>Tim Urban</cite></blockquote>



<p>And his siblings?</p>



<blockquote><p>It’s a similar story with my two sisters. After living in a house with them for 10 and 13 years respectively, I now live across the country from both of them and spend maybe 15 days with each of them a year. Hopefully, that leaves us with about 15% of our total hangout time left.</p><cite>Tim Urban</cite></blockquote>



<p>For me, it’s a little different. My dad and my sister (and only sibling) both died years ago. I’ve used 100% of my time with them. </p>



<p>Now it’s just me and my mom, who lives right across the street. We get to see each other a lot, but she’s getting older. I hope to have 500 more days that include some time with her, but that may be optimistic.</p>



<p>Tim then talks about his old high school friends: </p>



<blockquote><p>Now, scattered around the country with totally different lives and schedules, the five of us are in the same room at the same time probably 10 days each decade. The group is in its final 7%.</p><cite>Tim Urban</cite></blockquote>



<p>I doubt I’ll ever see a single one of my high school friends again intentionally. I’ve used 100% of my time with my old friends.</p>



<p>DHH (of Basecamp and Ruby on Rails fame) wrote one of my favorite posts/rants of all time: “<a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/growing-apart-and-losing-touch-is-human-and-healthy/">Growing apart and losing touch is human and healthy</a>“. Here’s a choice quote:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m not the same person I was in high school. Not the same person I was at university. Not the same person I was with friends at age 15 as I was with a different group of friends at 21. I’m still not the same person with friends in programming as I am with friends in racing or with family or old mates from Denmark.</p><p>What allowed me to change and prosper was the freedom to grow apart and lose touch with people. It’s hard to change yourself if you’re stuck in the same social orbit. There’s a gravitational force that pulls you into repeating the same circular pattern over and over again. Breaking out of that takes tremendous force.</p><cite>DHH</cite></blockquote>



<p>It’s easy to read <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html">The Tail End</a> and end up feeling sad about the time we have left and the time we’ve used up.</p>



<p>No thanks. I will not cry about moving on from my high school friends any more than I’ll cry about moving on from roller blading or my once beloved Sega Dreamcast. </p>



<p>Tim’s post ends with this:</p>



<blockquote><p>Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities. Make sure this list is set by you—not by unconscious inertia.</p><cite>Tim Urban</cite></blockquote>



<p>Exactly. I decide who to spend my future with. And it’s not based on who I spent my past with. </p>

      <p>Now that I'm running most of my services on <a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a>,
I was curious about the state security-wise of its libc, <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a>,
which used to be <em>dire</em> to say the least last time I looked at it.</p>
<h2 id="zeroing-memory"><a href="#zeroing-memory">Zeroing memory</a></h2>
<p>Albeit <code>bzero</code> is deprecated (marked as LEGACY in POSIX.1-2001, removed in POSIX.1-2008),
musl provides <a href="https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/string/bzero.c"><code>bzero</code></a>,
as well as the nonstandard <code>explicit_bzero</code> (also known as <code>memset_explicit()</code> or <code>memset_s()</code> in other libc)
to ensure that secret don't stay laying around in memory.</p>
<h2 id="support-of-_fortify_source"><a href="#support-of-_fortify_source">Support of _FORTIFY_SOURCE</a></h2>
<p>_FORTIFY_SOURCE is supported via a <a href="https://git.2f30.org/fortify-headers/file/README.html">libc-agnostic set of headers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="invalid-state-handling"><a href="#invalid-state-handling">Invalid state handling</a></h2>
<p>musl uses <code>assert</code>, which is a wrapper around <code>__assert_fail</code> to validate
assumptions and catch invalid states/violations, resulting in an immediate halt
of the program, instead of doing some dangerous magic to parse the callstack
and the environment.</p>
<h2 id="csprng"><a href="#csprng">CSPRNG</a></h2>
<p>Currently, musl <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2018/07/02/5">doesn't</a>
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2017/11/27/14">provide</a> a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator">CSPRNG</a>,
but it's on the todo-list.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-n"><a href="#support-for-n">Support for %n</a></h2>
<p>Nowadays, the only reasonable usage of the <code>%n</code> specifier in <code>printf</code> and its
friends is to mount <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_format_string">format-string attacks</a>.
But since musl aims at being as compliant as possible, this specifier is unfortunately <a href="https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/stdio/vfprintf.c">implemented and
available</a>.
It could be interesting to put it being a define, a bit like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/hf4y5e3w(v=vs.140)">Visual Studio is
doing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="relro"><a href="#relro">RELRO</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://tk-blog.blogspot.com/2009/02/relro-not-so-well-known-memory.html">RELRO</a> is supported
since <a href="https://musl.libc.org/releases.html">musl 1.1.0</a>, released in April
2014.</p>
<h2 id="atexit-hardening"><a href="#atexit-hardening">atexit hardening</a></h2>
<p>It's <a href="https://binholic.blogspot.com/2017/05/notes-on-abusing-exit-handlers.html">old</a>
<a href="https://buffer.antifork.org/security/heap_atexit.txt">news</a> that <code>atexit</code> is a
cool vector to transform and arbitrary r/w into arbitrary code exec. glibc <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/master/stdlib/cxa_atexit.c">is
using
mangling</a>,
like
<a href="https://moflow.org/Presentations/200703%20EuSecWest%20-%20Windows%20Vista%20Exploitation%20Countermeasures/rjohnson%20-%20Windows%20Vista%20Exploitation%20Countermeasures.pdf">microsoft</a>,
OpenBSD <a href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/mitigations/atexit_hardening/">marks them as
RO</a>. Unfortunately,
musl <a href="https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/exit/atexit.c">doesn't do any defensive in this area</a>.</p>
<h2 id="stack-cookies"><a href="#stack-cookies">Stack cookies</a></h2>
<p>Building musl with stack-based overflow hardening (think "cookies") is possible since <a href="https://musl.libc.org/releases.html">musl
1.1.9</a>, released in May 2015.</p>
<h2 id="setjmplongjmp-hardening"><a href="#setjmplongjmp-hardening">Setjmp/longjmp hardening</a></h2>
<p><code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code> can be used to transform a limited write + jmp into an
arbitrary write to registers and more. The glibc does some <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/commit/272b289859eff42d77fac6cf3125b38b0ff01791#diff-d89bba48e8edf8d5ff67f6d548cd8306">mangling</a>, like the <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/9d294f3012b8bf3b592930ba1f7a456527cf33e0">OpenBSD libc</a>,
while Microsoft does <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/control-flow-guard-improvements-windows-10-anniversary-update/">sanity check</a> (validating that the stack pointer is pointing to the stack, that the instruction pointers points within the current module, all well as validated <code>setjmp</code> callsites, …). musl doesn't do <a href="https://github.com/ifduyue/musl/blob/master/src/setjmp/i386/longjmp.s">any hardening</a> there.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-with-san"><a href="#compatibility-with-san">Compatibility with *SAN</a></h2>
<p>Currently, musl <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1080">isn't compatible</a>
with ASAN/MSAN/TSAN/UBSAN/… which isn't really super-duper important since I'm
not fuzzing with musl anyway.</p>
<h2 id="development-practises"><a href="#development-practises">Development practises</a></h2>
<p>musl's development is pretty old school: a <a href="https://wiki.musl-libc.org/reporting-bugs.html">mailing
list</a> for bug tracker, a <a href="https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl">cgit
repository</a>, no continuous builds nor
integrations with static analysers like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverity">coverity</a> or
<a href="https://lgtm.com/">LGTM</a>, 
no fuzzing, … meh.</p>
<h2 id="memory-allocator"><a href="#memory-allocator">Memory allocator</a></h2>
<p>This is the juicy part of the blogpost: userland heap management. musl
used to have a terrible (security-wise) allocator, replaced with <code>malloc-ng</code>
as part of <a href="https://musl.libc.org/releases.html">musl 1.2</a> released in August
2020.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a>,
  <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/MallocInternals">ptmalloc</a>,
  <a href="https://www.nedprod.com/programs/portable/nedmalloc/">nedmalloc</a>, … are all
  using per thread memory pools, while musl uses a global lock, likely to
    guarantee global consistency and avoid race-conditions that could result in
    undetected memory corruption exploitations. On the downside, this might
    result in contention on multi-threaded programs.</li>
<li>Freed and allocated memory isn't zeroed, so data leak from previously
    allocated memory is possible. Zeroing on free and checking if the zone is
    still zeroed upon allocation would detect <code>write-after-free</code> at this time,
    but this would likely be too expensive. Zeroing the first 8-bytes would be a
    good compromise.</li>
<li>There are no guard pages everywhere à la <a href="https://elinux.org/Electric_Fence">Electric Fence</a>,
    but only a fixed-size one below the out-of-band metadata.
    But since the allocator is often returning freed memory to the system,
    this tends to leave unmmaped chunks scattered around.</li>
<li>There is a single global secret, generated once via ASLR, or using
    <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getauxval.3.html"><code>AT_RANDOM</code></a> if
    available, used to check that chunks aren't forged. Unfortunately, it's not
    recomputed for every chunk but simply stored in them, meaning that if
    leaked once, it's game over.</li>
<li>There are pointers to the OOB metadata inside of the chunk, allowing an
    attacker with limited reads to rapidly gain access to the secret.</li>
<li>It's not possible to free unaligned chunks, and if the attacker doesn't have
    read capabilities, it's also impossible to free non-allocated chunks, making
    it possible to detect double-free and invalid-free deterministically.</li>
<li>When freed, chunks are put in a FIFO, making it a bit harder to trigger an
    use-after-free, but since no randomization is applied there, it's not <em>that</em>
    hard. Also, it could be interesting to quarantine the memory by marking it as
    <code>PROT_NONE</code> to catch low-hanging stuff.</li>
<li>Zero-size allocations aren't treated as a special case. They used to be
    pretty wild due to their underspecified interaction with <code>realloc</code>,
    but are <a href="http://www.hackitoergosum.org/2010/HES2010-jvanegue-Zero-Allocations.pdf">still scary nowadays</a>.
    malloc-ng's design prevents using pointing at a non-rw area instead,
    and decision was made that the added complexity of wiring something to handle
    this special case wasn't worth it.</li>
<li>Single-byte overflows are detected via a NULL-canary at the end of the
    allocation at re-allocation/free time, to prevent string-related problems,
    but it could be interesting to make it a bit larger, and add some
    randomization to it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Generally better than
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">glibc</a>/<a href="https://uclibc.org/">µClibc</a>/<a href="https://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/">dietlibc</a>/<a href="https://uclibc-ng.org/">µClibc-ng</a>/… allocator-wise,
which is the biggest attack-surface, but worse than <a href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/mitigations/">OpenBSD's one</a>.
More than decent in my threat model.</p>

<article>
<p><span>When building a startup, you have many options for software development. Whether you </span><a href="https://altar.io/whats-the-best-way-to-build-your-startup-cto-freelancers-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>hire a team of developers, outsource to an agency, or find a CTO</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While all of these options are viable, if you find a </span><span>CTO with the right tech expertise, you’ll have gained a key player to help you succeed. </span><span>But remember, if you pick the wrong CTO you won’t survive long – you may not even make it to launch.</span></p>
<p><span>I bet you keep hearing that “Finding your dream CTO is not easy”. It’s true; it takes a lot of time and commitment. That’s why many founders spend years looking for the perfect person for the job, myself included.&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*pUvlHpx9e4m6OWuO" alt="Alfred: &quot;Do you need assistance to find a CTO master Wayne?&quot; " width="100%" data-image-id="0*pUvlHpx9e4m6OWuO" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>When I first started founding startups, I experienced the hurdles of finding a CTO first-hand. Over the la</span><span>st 14 years, I have built many projects. It took me more than 30 months and more than 300 headaches before I found the right guy for the job.</span></p>
<p><span>But when I found him, he nailed it. And he kept on nailing it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Usually, the conflict is: You want to start </span><a href="https://altar.io/service-mvp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>building your MVP</span></a><span> as soon as possible, so you might feel tempted to commit to the first decent option you find. On the other hand, you know this is one of the most crucial decisions you will make as a </span><a href="https://altar.io/what-the-non-technical-entrepreneur-needs-to-know-about-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>non-tech founder</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>There are certain traits to look out for as you try to find a CTO. Many wannabe CTOs will display the same characteristics. This includes overpromising and underdelivering on a massive scale – but more on that later.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve taken my experience building six startups, advising dozens and </span><a href="https://altar.io/work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>working with many startup founders at Altar.io</span></a><span>, and identified the vital qualities every CTO should embody.</span></p>
<p><span>Before I list said qualities, it’s important to point out that </span><b>all</b><span> of them are vital. The fact is, your Robin needs to have it all, not few or most, all.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span>What To Look For In A CTO</span></h2>
<h3><strong>Passion</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>Your Robin should be more passionate about your idea than you are – or at least come a close second.&nbsp;</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Kfg9BwIQFYTC46ql" alt="Batman and Robin: Find a CTO with Passion" width="100%" data-image-id="0*Kfg9BwIQFYTC46ql" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>To be sure you’ve found your CTO remember: Passion is an essential trait highly correlated with the tenacity needed to traverse the dark alleys of the startup journey. Every startup faces hurdles. Unless you find a CTO that has a passion for your company; during the storms, you will be navigating the challenges alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before I move on, it’s essential to understand the market dynamics. We are currently in reversed HR dynamics as it pertains to finding CTOs and developers: the talent picks the company – not the other way round. This is due to more demand than supply. For example, last year for every five developer job postings, only one was filled.</span></p>
<p><span>So, if you find a CTO who’s good at what they do, chances are they’re already in a job, earning well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, a typical CTO salary in the US is between </span><a href="https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/chief-technology-officer-salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>$204,957 and $285,891</span></a><span> per annum (as of April 2020 – before bonuses &amp; benefits).&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*SOdtld9hzEfce1Li" alt="CTO Median Salary (annually) Apr 2020" width="711" height="301" data-image-id="0*SOdtld9hzEfce1Li" data-width="711" data-height="301"></figure>
<p><span>Given this, you get my perspective when I say:</span></p>
<p><span>Your CTO will most likely be taking a considerable salary; working on a project they enjoy. You will be asking them to drop all of that for your early-stage idea. It’s what you have to do. But there is no way they’re going to give up a lucrative job for your startup unless they’re genuinely passionate about your idea, I mean obsessed-passionate (otherwise they’re </span><span>just crazy or faking it).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s even harder to find someone at the right time who will drop their lucrative position and work just for sweat equity, no salary. As this founder experienced first-hand:&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><i>I spent six months trying to find a technical co-founder. The closest I got was Tom. He wasn’t a CTO but had the 5 years of experience I was told a co-founder needed. He was very busy, when I asked him to leave his job if I secured investment, he had second thoughts. Whilst he wasn’t a CTO on $244k, even the average developer salaries often are too good to give up!</i></p>


</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span> If you find someone willing to jump ship, it shows how passionate they are about your vision.</span></p>

<div>
<h4>My Advice:</h4>
<div>
<p>Be sceptical about a seemingly good candidate that doesn’t put up a good struggle to leave their position and join your crew – they may be overstating their worth.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Be prepared that it’s going to take time to find a CTO with this level of passion; the odds are slim, but not impossible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Responsibility</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>Passion is great but can make people blind. Make sure Robin is still sober enough to make responsible decisions.</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*pUzcxKef3m7uEK8q" alt="Batman &amp; Robin: Find a CTO who's Responsible" width="100%" data-image-id="0*pUzcxKef3m7uEK8q" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>With great power comes great responsibility. It’s important to find a CTO that is a responsible professional before onboarding them as your partner in crime.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<h4>My Advice:</h4>
<div>
<p>Test your potential CTO by asking for a simple deliverable. It should be something not too complicated, and you should give them a feasible time frame (again, if you are not sure on this ask an unbiased techie friend). It could be a piece of a technical challenge, but it could as well be a roadmap, budget estimate, etc.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If they don’t deliver, it’s a huge red flag. It brings into question the trust you can give them with your business – from both a responsibility and commitment perspective.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Tech Expertise</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>Make sure you’re talking to a real Robin; you may find an inexperienced guy behind that mask.</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Qu0Yd_mD5LmqEv-x" alt="Batman &amp; Robin: Find a CTO with tech expertise " width="100%" data-image-id="0*Qu0Yd_mD5LmqEv-x" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>You will find many wannabe CTOs. Your CTO must have the depth of knowledge to make the right technical decisions for your startup. This requires evaluation. Of course, if you don’t have a technical background, you think, “Ok, but how do I evaluate the tech expertise”, don’t worry I have a precise way to deal with that (which I will go into later).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Remember the importance of this point:</span><b> if your CTO lacks expertise, it can lead to bleeding ‘technical debt’ </b><span>– such as incorrect or substandard code and unwise technology choices – to name but two.</span></p>
<p><span>You should find a CTO who is, at the very least, as good at their job as you are at yours. You should be equals, working in different disciplines, towards the same goal.</span></p>

<div>
<h4>My Advice:</h4>
<div>
<p>Study your potential CTO’s portfolio and ask an unbiased expert (who is exempt from your search) to validate the quality of their previous work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Benchmark: Ask your candidate to elaborate their tech rationale on technologies, architecture and infrastructure. Alongside this, ask a <a href="https://altar.io/start-a-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software development agency to do the same thing.</a> Some agencies will give you their insights on which technologies, architecture and infrastructure you should follow at a lead stage – without any cost.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Commitment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>Can you imagine a part-time Robin? Me neither!</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*OLCF6FjTLt0CqvUW" alt="Batman &amp; Robin: A CTO with Commitment " width="100%" data-image-id="0*OLCF6FjTLt0CqvUW" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>You and your CTO will face many hurdles together on the road to success; if they don’t fully commit, your success will get further and further out of reach.</span></p>
<p><span>As I’ve talked about in a previous article, there is nothing worse than “getting married” to a CTO or technical co-founder who’s not fully committed. You will end up living in the “mistress syndrome”.&nbsp; This occurs when your CTO has another full-time job and ends up treating you and your startup as a “side-gig”. This will result in you committing to your company more than them – creating an imbalance in your relationship that is harmful.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<h4>My Advice:</h4>
<div>
<p>You should find a CTO that is prepared to commit as much as you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>You should coordinate with your CTO and make sure you agree on the business’ milestones: The deadlines on the creation and delivery of your MVP, product iterations, etc. It’s essential to reach common ground before you plan the wedding!</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Founders’ Alignment</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>You and your Robin should agree on a plan before taking justice to the streets; you don’t want to face the Joker unprepared.</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*0Kbl3sO33NY1kKdn" alt="Batman &amp; Robin: Founder's Alignment " width="100%" data-image-id="0*0Kbl3sO33NY1kKdn" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>This point is highly relevant if you are bringing your CTO on board as your technical co-founder.</span></p>
<p><span>You will spend many hours working directly with your technical co-founder. So it’s crucial that you first like the person you onboard. Secondly, you should be able to trust this person with your money, ideas &amp; business. It really will become a “business marriage”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><b>Related: </b><a href="https://altar.io/intellectual-humility-and-the-7-traits-of-great-co-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>7 Traits to Consider if You Want to Find the Perfect Co-founder</span></a></strong></p>
<p><span>As I mentioned, it may take years to find a CTO for your startup. If you think you’ve found them, your expectations must be aligned. You should agree on:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Product &amp; company roadmap</span></li>
<li><span>Co-founder equity split &amp; salaries&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Work culture</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>You will both be responsible for balancing the needs of the business, technology and even product; now and as your team grows. Therefore the overall paths you both envision for your startup have to coexist. By no means will you agree on everything 100% of the time, which is why it’s essential to have those lines of communication open.</span></p>
<p><span>Conversely, you don’t want someone who “sweats the small stuff”; when you and your CTO discuss every minute detail. I like to call this an “atomic relationship”. In my experience, it will result in using all of your energy and time discussing the wrong topics, taking attention from those that do.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>
<h4>My Advice:</h4>
<div>
<p>Discuss all the mentioned points (Product/Company roadmap, Equity split &amp; salaries and Work culture) before you make any kind of commitment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As in any relationship, be ready to discuss contentious points and, at times, prepare to compromise. Don’t waste your time with someone who gets stuck in the unnecessary details. As much as we would all like to admit, myself included, that energy is infinite, it is not.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><strong>Leadership Skills</strong></h3>
<h5><span><i><span>It’s important that Robin leaves the Batcave and can assemble a league of citizens to help clean up Gotham.</span></i></span></h5>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*loMbXybeWtILe5iC" alt="Batman &amp; Robin: A CTO is a Leader" width="100%" data-image-id="0*loMbXybeWtILe5iC" data-width="1440" data-height="978"></figure>
<p><span>There are many </span><a href="https://altar.io/looking-developers-10-developer-archetypes-youre-likely-encounter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>archetypes of developers</span></a><span>, and a few stereotypes to boot. One of the most popular being that they share a disposition for sitting alone in their “cave” accompanied exclusively by seven monitors, a coffee machine, half a dozen red bull and very little light.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For developers, these archetypes are ok; your CTO, however, is a different thing entirely. You need to find a CTO that can strategically build, grow and lead the …</span></p></article></div></div>

                    <p><em><em>Welcome </em>again <em>HN! <a href="https://darklang.com/">Dark</a> is a programming language, structured editor, and infrastructure—all in one—whose goal is to make it 100x easier to build backend services. Check out the <a href="https://darklang.com/">website</a>, our <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/what-is-dark/">What is Dark</a> post, and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/how-dark-deploys-code-in-50ms/">How Dark deploys in 50ms</a></em> <em>for more. Thanks for checking us out!</em></em></p><p><em>This is the third or a 3-part series: <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">Leaving OCaml</a> and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">Dark's new backend will be in F#</a>. You can enjoy this without reading the previous posts.</em></p><p>With the election in the state it is, I'm going to stop pretending that I can do work right now. So instead, I'll just milk the success of my last <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">two</a> <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">posts</a> and hope that none of you are really working right now either.</p><p>As discussed in the two <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">previous</a> <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">posts</a>, Dark is moving to F#. This has been a bit of a surprise to people, including me. We've spoken for years about the inevitable Rust rewrite; we have a CLI written in Rust and two services, so I was pretty sure that it was going to be Rust.</p><p>People asked about a few other languages as well, so let's get them out of the way first.</p><h3 id="clojure">Clojure</h3><p>I have a lot of experience with Clojure, as CircleCI was almost all Clojure. However, we spent a whole lot of time with dealing accidental complexity, specifically "what type is this field" and nulls all over the place. So I deliberately chose not to have a dynamically typed language, even though Clojure is a lovely language. A side benefit is to escape the Cult of Rich in the Clojure community. Hearing his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug">Maybe Not</a> talk really cemented for me how deep down the dynamically typed rabbit hole they are over there, and how much I disagree with that.</p><h3 id="haskell">Haskell</h3><p>I had previously tried to love Haskell, trying to <a href="https://github.com/pbiggar/rash">write an interpreter</a> in it while I was at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, and I did not like it. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24978238">HN user momentumtop's explanation</a> match my feelings exactly:</p><blockquote>The Haskell community, in my experience, is far more academic. A<a href="https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2020-September/030789.html"> recent post to the Haskell libraries mailing list</a> began with:<p>"It was pointed out to me in a private communication that the tuple function \x-&gt;(x,x) is actually a special case of a diagonalization for biapplicative and some related structures monadicially.</p><p>It received 39 pretty enthusiast replies.</p></blockquote><h3 id="scala">Scala</h3><p>I have no experience with Scala, but my overwhelming sense of the language and the community is that the whole thing is a mess. So I didn't consider it, and still wouldn't.</p><p>I actually <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">wrote quite a bit on why I didn't like Rust</a> a few weeks ago. I think those main reasons stand, so I'll just link to them rather than repeat the <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">1800 words</a> again. As a quick summary, the good parts were:</p><ul><li>tooling is great</li><li>library ecosystem is great</li><li>community is great</li><li>macros are nice (though I feel I was overusing them to cover problems in the language)</li></ul><p>and the bad parts were</p><ul><li>having to do memory management sucks</li><li>pattern matching doesn't work all that well</li><li>too many ways to do things (Arc vs Rc, async vs sync, different stdlibs)</li><li>the language isn't immutable</li><li>having to fight the compiler</li></ul><p>Again, for more on those, have a <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">read of the previous post</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, when it came time to decide, it came down to a few major things: missing a GCP library, and the low-level nature of the language.</p><h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2><p>Rust has a ton of libraries, and they work really well and are nicely integrated. They have 3rdparty libraries for <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a>, <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>, and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/why-dark-didnt-choose-rust/rollbar.com">Rollbar</a>, which are important services for us. However, the <a href="https://github.com/Byron/google-apis-rs">library for GCP</a> seems super sketch. It's autogenerated and the issues imply that they've gone as far as they can using this technique. So that seemed very risky to take on, given that the whole point was to have a much richer library ecosystem.</p><h2 id="async">Async</h2><p>When I wrote the <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">previous post</a>, I had just gotten the <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/tree/main/rust-hyper">synchronous version</a> of the benchmark to work in Rust. Then I tried to <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/tree/main/rust-hyper-async/execution-engine">make it async</a>. I really struggled with making things async. Apparently, recursion adds <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/07_workarounds/04_recursion.html">a new level of complexity</a> to async. But the thing that killed me was <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/04_pinning/01_chapter.html">pinning</a>.</p><p>Let's see if I can explain this. When you're writing an async, multi-threaded server in using the tokio runtime, async processes can be moved between threads. This means the memory can be copied, and so you need to ... pin things? OK, that's as much as I remember. Look in the HN comments after I publish this and I'm sure someone will explain better. The code <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/blob/main/rust-hyper-async/execution-engine/src/eval.rs">is over here</a> if you're interested.</p><p>I tried to get my head around this for some time, before deciding that this was a waste of time. Apparently, this boxing and pinning is what you get when you don't have a GC, and that when you do have a GC, you simply don't need to deal with it. So that was the final straw for me.</p><h2 id="rust-is-a-low-level-language">Rust is a low-level language</h2><p>I'm implementing a language that's basically F#/OCaml. So it makes sense that it's easier to implement in F#/OCaml. A few people pointed out that I'm trying to write OCaml in Rust, and that's not really what it was designed for. I think that's right. Rust's semantics makes many things easy, but not what I'm trying to do.</p><p>I think most of us don't need Rust. I think Rust is a wonderful community, ecosystem, and tooling, wrapping a language that nicely solves a problem very few of us have. It's just so nice over there, until you actually write code.</p><p>It's easy to forget, given how nice everything is with the error messages and the docs, that Rust is a very low-level language. We're so attracted to the community and the tooling that we forget that low-level languages suck. Maybe Rust has a better story than most low-level languages, but remember that garbage collectors are great. By having a GC, we don't have to do any of the stuff that causes all these problems in Rust. Maybe that costs performance, but I need the ability to quickly write code a lot more than I need the extra performance.</p><p>And ultimately, that's <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">why I picked F#</a>.</p><hr><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>You can sign up for Dark </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><a href="https://darklang.com/signup" rel="noopener nofollow"><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>here</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></a><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.

<p>If you are a startup founder or a product manager thinking of what to do next with your product, which features to implement first and how to better understand your target audiences needs, you are reading the correct article.</p>
<p>Today I am going to write about why we made Juphy's product roadmap public and how it helped us to better understand our customers needs in the most efficient way. </p>
<h2 id="what-s-a-public-product-roadmap-and-how-can-you-use-it-">What's a Public Product Roadmap and How Can You Use It?</h2>
<p>A public product roadmap is an easily accessible online page where your potential users, customers, team, investors and other stakeholders can view your roadmap, give feedback and decide on the future of your product. </p>
<p>Nine months ago we started using Canny for Juphy's public roadmap and we highly recommend it. Our users can request new features, upvote other feature requests, report bugs, follow Juphy's product roadmap and progress on Canny. This helps us to prioritize feature requests, track user feedback in a very organized manner, keep customers up to date on new improvements and make better product decisions by understanding the needs of our customers. Today we are very proud to publicly share our roadmap as well as why we recommend it to other startups. </p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-having-a-public-product-roadmap">Advantages of Having a Public Product Roadmap</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.juphy.com/nn_themes/juphy/img/posts/benefits-of-public-product-roadmap.png" alt="benefits-of-public-product-roadmap"></p>
<h3 id="1-better-understanding-of-customers-needs">1. Better Understanding of Customers Needs</h3>
<p>The first and the most important reason of why we have a public roadmap is to better understand our customers needs and develop a product that they can not live without. Having a public roadmap is a perfect way to get feedback from your users about what's most important to them in your product/service and it allows you to be more certain in your decision making. When your roadmap is public and open to feedback, product managers and founders have to spend less time doing market research to figure out what your potential users want. Rather, they can collect feedback through a platform like Canny and eventually have more time to focus on actually building the product. This will also help them to leave aside biases and gut feelings when making product decisions.  </p>
<h3 id="2-transparency-builds-trust">2. Transparency Builds Trust</h3>
<p>A significant reason to make your product roadmap public is to increase transparency between your company and customers. When users can contribute on your roadmap, they are showing a level of dedication to your product. It creates a community where customers are actively contributing to the future of your product by creating new feature requests and upvoting already existing requests. After all, they are able to track your teams progress and will know that their feedback is heard and respected by your organization. That alone builds trust and dedication to your company. </p>
<h3 id="3-manages-expectations">3. Manages Expectations</h3>
<p>When users can view your product roadmap, they can see what your current priorities are and get a sense of your goals. Canny's feature voting enables you to set expectations for which features are coming as much as which isn't. Your public roadmap will also manage expectations in several other ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>If a current customer sees active work on a feature they really want, it will reduce your churn rate as the customer will most probably wait for that feature to be live.</li>
<li>Similarly, a public roadmap can serve as a sales tool for potential customers as your sales team will be able to show that you are currently working on features that they need.</li>
<li>Or on the opposite side, if a feature request has a very limited number of votes, users can better understand why you haven't implemented their feedback. This prevents your users from being disappointed if their feature request is not put into action.</li>
<li>Finally, if you update your roadmap regularly, customers can easily see your progress on a certain feature and won't reach out to you to ask about progress. This will save you time and money in terms of customer support.</li>
<li>Most importantly, users will appreciate and value the fact that you’re continually working to improve based on their needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.juphy.com/nn_themes/juphy/img/posts/public-roadmap-voting.png" alt="public-roadmap-voting"></p>
<h3 id="4-improves-internal-communication">4. Improves Internal Communication</h3>
<p>Lastly, having a public roadmap gives all your employees a clear direction of your product which prevents uncertainty and improves motivation. It especially allows non-customer facing employees such as engineers to build a connection and better understand customers. They are able to gain direct insight into what customers are looking for, and prioritize their work based on the upvotes on your public roadmap. </p>
<p>On the recruitment side, candidates can view the product roadmap in advance and come in with very specific knowledge about the product, the company direction and what type of capabilities are required for this job. This allows you to ask more targeted questions about their skills and gives them a real idea about what kinds of projects they will be contributing to. Overall, the hiring process will be far more efficient. </p>
<p>On the support side, your team can instantly share your roadmap with customers, prospects and other stakeholders without asking for what's happening, which features are going to be added, etc. which will enable a more informative and rapid sales process.</p>
<h3 id="competitors-can-see-your-roadmap">Competitors Can See Your Roadmap</h3>
<p>While considering to make your product roadmap public, the first disadvantage that comes to mind is the fact that competitors will get a clear idea of your products direction. However, we believe that the advantages of having a public roadmap outweigh the disadvantages, and focusing on competition is a distraction. It is always a better idea to stay focused on your customers needs and execute your roadmap to the best of your ability. In the meantime, as Bri from Canny says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If competitors are looking to your roadmap for inspiration, that means they’re leaning on your customer base to tell them what to build—not their own. At the end of the day, this will hurt them, not you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We totally agree with her and we couldn't be more happier to use Canny.</p>
<p>Overall, we believe that having a public product roadmap is a great way to better understand our customers needs while creating a highly valuable community and making more confident product decisions for Juphy. We definitely recommend other startups to consider this option and we would like to take this opportunity to thank Canny's co-founders Sarah and Andrew for creating such a great product. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In this post I will explore the idea that because running code contributes to global warming, writing inefficient code is morally wrong<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I will start by outlining the argument, before working through each of the premises in turn to see how they hold up. I will then conclude that even if we cannot concretely defend every premise in this first iteration, then it is sufficiently plausible that it should at least make us pause for thought. With that said, let’s dive in!</p><p>The argument I am considering, in summary, can be presented as:</p><ol><li>Running code produces greenhouse gasses, proportional to the computing resources it requires.</li><li>Greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming.</li><li>Global warming increases the suffering of others.</li><li>Therefore, increasing your consumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li><li>Inefficient code increases your consumption of computing resources.</li><li>Therefore, inefficient code increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li><li>Increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is morally wrong.</li><li>Therefore, writing inefficient code is morally wrong.</li></ol><p>I believe the argument as laid out above is valid, in that the conclusions follow from the premises, so we will focus our energies on determining if it is sound, that is all the premises are true. We will now break it down and look at each premise more carefully.</p><blockquote><ol><li>Running code produces greenhouse gasses, proportional to the computing resources it requires.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The first premise is based on the fact that running code requires electricity. Electricy, in large, requires the burning of fossil fuels, which releases a number of greenhouse gasses. There are cases where this is not the case (solar energy, wind energy), and in such cases, this argument is invalid. However, if you run your code on AWS, then it is very likely that you are running on fossil fuels<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. As AWS is the largest provider of cloud computing, this is likely to be true in a good number of cases.</p><blockquote><ol start="2"><li>Greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming.</li><li>Global warming increases the suffering of others.</li></ol></blockquote><p>With regards to the second and third premises, these are statements which are consistent with the overwhelming scientific consensus, and as such are uncontroversial. For the sake of completeness, here are some supporting statements from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf">2014 climate change report summary</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emphasis mine.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history</strong>. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia</strong>. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems</strong>. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems.</strong> Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development.</p></blockquote><p>I believe these to be enough to support the argument that greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming, and that global warming will increase suffering of the human and other animal populations.</p><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>Therefore, increasing your consiumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li></ol></blockquote><p>So here we come to our first conclusion, that increasing ones consumption of computing resources increases ones contribution to the suffering of others. It is based on at least two implicit premises. The first is that if A contributes to B, and B causes C, A contributes to C. The second is that in such a transitive relationship, if you increase your contribution to A then you increase your contribution to C. To illustrate, we can imagine a much more straightforward case. Imagine that I have a dial which, when turned, increases the voltage supplied to an electric chair. There are several such dials, and their contributions are additive. It would be fair to say that if I turned up my dial, I am contributing to the suffering of whoever is in that electric chair.</p><p>Given this assertion, it would seem reasonable that if running code produces greenhouse gasses, and greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming, then running code contributes to global warming. Global warming increases the suffering of others, so it follows that running code increases ones contribution to the suffering of others.</p><blockquote><ol start="5"><li>Inefficient code increases your consumption of computing resources.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Premise five seems relatively uncontroversial, though to simplify let us just consider the length of time some piece of code takes to run (in a similar way we assess algorithmic complexity). If an efficient version runs in 1 minute, and an inefficient version runs in 1 hour, it stands to reason that the inefficient version would consume more electricity.</p><blockquote><ol start="6"><li>Therefore, inefficient code increases your contribution to the suffering of others</li></ol></blockquote><p>With point six we again come to a relatively straightforward conclusion. If you agree with the earlier conclusion at point four and the premise at point five, then this falls out as a result of the logic of the statements.</p><blockquote><ol start="7"><li>Increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is morally wrong.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Point seven is the real crux of the argument, and on the surface intuitively plausible. In the above example with the dial, it would generally be considered morally wrong for you to dial up the dial and increase the suffering of the individual in the chair. However, if we are merely counting <em>contributions</em> to suffering, this casts a wide net. Would it be morally wrong not to buy an energy efficient bulb when an energy efficient one is available at the same price? How about breathing? This expels carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, but would generally not be considered a morally reprehensible action.</p><p>It seems that there is some inherent provision that increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is not morally wrong if it causes equal or greater personal suffering. For example, if there was some shared well of water, it would be reasonable to claim that it is not morally wrong of you to take a sip of water in order to save yourself from dehydration, even if that means other may become more dehydrated. However, if you drained the well, and threw that water away, causing another to die to dehydration, that seems morally wrong.</p><p>I think for the purposes of this post, we can consider this sufficiently true (there is definitely some sense in which it is true), even if is vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a> in it’s current form. Consider it the alpha version of the premise - solid enough to be useful, but not without it’s bugs.</p><blockquote><ol start="8"><li>Therefore, writing inefficient code is morally wrong.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Here we come to the conclusion of the argument, that writing inefficient code is morally wrong, which follows from the logic set out in the conclusion at point six and the premise at point seven. So what does this mean?</p><p>As discussed, I am aware that this argument is probably not watertight, and perhaps with some more time spent on it we could tighten it up<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. I think the premise at point seven could definitely be better defended, and there almost certainly some implicit premises and caveats that need to be put in place. However, I think it is reasonable enough that it should make us pause and reflect. Whilst a lot of code performance issues can be covered up with bigger and better hardware, these come at a greater cost than just an increased AWS bill. The decisions we make as developers have real world effects.</p><p>If there are ways that we can reduce ‘programming waste’ we should strive to do so, whether that is changing an algorithm to be <code>O(1)</code>, scaling down some cloud instances or killing of that Heroku dyno that’s not really doing anything useful<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.

<p>Since popularization of my project MANOOL has been apparently going to nowhere, I've decided to rather invest some time in my self-education, learning new
technologies and pondering about new opportunities. Surprisingly this has resulted in a concrete and viable plan for the future improvements (that is, for
MANOOL-2). If someone would like to join the project at this stage, I would be glad (any help is welcome, even with just testing the concepts).</p>

<p>For those who are not familiar with the project: MANOOL seeks to bridge the gap, in the least troublesome way, between the exploratory style of programming (for
which languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, or Scheme are normally used) and the more thorough style (where languages like C, C++, Java, or Rust are a
better fit), and this is something I was in fact thinking about for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>So, according to the plan, MANOOL evolves into a general-purpose language equally suitable for exploratory programming and systems programming, and even
high-performance computing (at least on traditional computer architectures, since nowadays some HPC solutions run on GPGPU and FPGA devices, and hypothetically
on emerging quantum computers, each case demanding a particular coding style usually available only in specialized, domain-specific programming languages).</p>

<p>For certain reasons (not discussed here due to lack of space) exploratory programming normally involves high-level semantics and especially the dynamic typing
discipline (when data types in programs are associated with values or objects at run time instead of variables or expressions during program compilation, as
opposed to the static typing). On the other hand, systems programming and HPC presume, well, high run-time performance. These properties conflict with each
other, since dynamic typing usually means that computers make more decisions at program run time, which slows down performance by itself and also hinders
further performance optimizations.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, real-world applications often consist of components with different flexibility and performance requirements. For instance, an application may
include inherently dynamic event-driven user interface code and much more static domain area (back-end) code where most hot (critical) instruction paths are
concentrated.</p>

<p>Sophisticated (and expensive in implementation) JIT compilation techniques (used, e.g., in V8 and Mozilla's JavaScript VMs and LuaJIT), including the so-called
tracing JIT, allow you to gain great performance for dynamic languages. Still, such techniques hardly satisfy the above goal and offer notably lower performance
than classic ahead-of-time compilation for equivalent programs written in an inherently static language (such as C, Modula-2, Ada, or Rust, to name a more
recent language); the slowdown may be somewhere between 4 and 10 times (which is still an impressive improvement compared to what more affordable
implementations offer). This happens because in practice such VMs have to anticipate the program execution profile (and hence data types) at run time (with
varying success) instead of exploiting static hints the programmer might provide about the profile, either explicitly or rather implicitly.</p>

<p>Due to the conflict described above, other languages that do achieve the above goal (e.g., Objective-C) are normally hybrid languages that solve the problem by
combining and providing both low-level but high-performance features with high-level but low-performance ones (for instance, Objective-C semantically and even
syntactically looks like a mix between C and Smalltalk).</p>

<p>The approach MANOOL-2 adopts is different: MANOOL-2 is essentially a dynamically typed language with no explicit HPC-related features (such as static types),
but its type system is specifically devised to enable significant amount of type inference during compilation (with sporadic or rather implicit help from the
programmer). In MANOOL-2 this inference is based on long-established data and control flow analysis algorithms and function inlining, and there seems to be an
intimate connection between type inference and constant/value/condition propagation (including their interprocedural variants). Note that typing discipline
(static vs dynamic) is orthogonal to this issue: there is still no such thing as “false negatives due to failed type checks” in MANOOL-2.</p>

<p>The advantage of this approach is that the programmer uses a more compact language and thus has to master fewer features and make fewer decisions as to which
features to use in each particular case and for each particular component of the program (the programmer still should be aware of how the compiler infers types
and performs other deductions and which coding techniques lead to the maximum performance boost in hot paths, but performance hints can be introduces gradually,
if needed at all).</p>

<p>Perhaps the closest such project is Julia. However, Julia is specifically oriented on the area of scientific computing, has high startup times, and still offers
suboptimal performance (albeit better than JavaScript or Lua). MANOOL-2 should overcome such issues, and it is a viable goal according to my preliminary
experiments.</p>

<p>Note that apart from higher run-time performance, statically typed languages are also traditionally associated with higher software engineering standards, as
opposed to “quick-and-dirty” exploratory style solutions. However, the position MANOOL-2 adopts is that a sophisticated static type system used for defect
preventing purposes (while being useful in practice) should belong better to external tools and not to the programming language itself (though, the type system
of MANOOL-2 makes it more suitable for programming in-the-large in comparison to an ordinary dynamically typed language).</p>

<p>All of the above is not just a business idea. I have actually performed some experiments and studied viability of the optimization algorithms and (what's most
important) what limitations of such algorithms can and should be condoned in practice. And of course, there is also the current version of MANOOL as a starting
point. In conclusion and as a matter of simple illustration, here is a piece of code in MANOOL-2 with some comments regarding its expected high-performance
hallmarks:</p>

<pre><code>{ {extern "manool.org.18/std/2.0/all"} in
: let
  Fold = -- left-fold some elements yielded by some generator G
  { proc I; Op; G as inline -- polymorphic procedure
  : do I after   -- refcounting for G on entry/exit is optimized out
  : for E = G do -- iterate over elements in RAM, no dynamic dispatch
    I = I!.Op[E] -- just "addsd" on x86, no dispatch or type checks
  }
  in
: let
  Avg = -- average elements of an array A of Binary64 floats
  { proc A as -- monomorphic procedure
    {assert Size[A.as[{array F64}]] &gt; 0} -- tiny O(1) overhead
    Fold[F64[0]$; (+); A] / F64[Size[A]] -- no dispatch or type checks
  }
  in
  -- The return type of Avg is actually known at compile-time - F64:
  Out.Write_line[Avg[{array F64}[F64[1] F64[2] F64[3] F64[4] F64[5]]$]]
  Out.Write_line[Avg[{array I64}[1 2 3 4 5]$]] -- signals Type_mismatch
}
</code></pre>

<hr>



<p><strong>Uncanny Vulvas- Diana Fleischman</strong></p>



<p>Sex is consistently underrated as a driver of innovation. Yes, space exploration helped us develop the technology for things like cochlear implants, powdered (machine) lubricants and scratch resistant lenses. Lust has furthered the development of cash transfers, point-of-view filming and video chat. I predict that historians of the development of artificial intelligence are going to see sexual gratification as one of the phenomenon’s great motivators. Evolutionary psychology can give us insight into how sex robots are going to develop and the ramifications they’ll have on society.</p>



<p>Sexbots are usually woman-shaped&nbsp;<em>gynoid</em>&nbsp;machines. At the&nbsp;present time,&nbsp;sex robots are simple: they’re silicone sex dolls that have some capacity for movement and response. Manufacturers are rolling out new models and new promises: sex robots that respond to touch and penetration, sex robots with interchangeable faces and bodies and sex robots with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/opinion/sex-robots-consent.html" target="_blank">different personalities</a>. Future robots will have the allure and cues of fertility of a flesh-and-blood woman combined with the artificial intelligence that creates compulsive reward directed behavior. An intelligence, unlike the intelligence of humans, that will have the gratification of its owner as the only goal. </p>



<p>Sex robots are overwhelmingly gynoid because heterosexual men drive the market for sexual products like prostitution and pornography. Across cultures, men desire more sexual partners, need to know someone for less time before they want to have sex with them, and have lower standards for a sexual liaison than women. Looking at gay men is instructive here. Their sexual interactions are not limited by women’s sexual choosiness and they, on average, have many more sexual partners than straight men or lesbians.</p>

<p>It isn’t hard to see the reason for this. Men don’t get pregnant and don’t lactate, and they have smaller, easier-to-produce sex cells than women.&nbsp;For a man, the cost of producing offspring is cheap. Getting one’s genes into the next generation is the engine of evolution. The low opportunity costs make men motivated to take every opportunity, even if it comes in the form of a robot. Ever think a dog is dumb for growling at his reflection in the mirror? Human men can become aroused looking at flat images of nude women in black and white,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_mismatch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our evolved psychology can respond in maladaptive ways towards novel stimuli.</a></p>



<p>Courtship is expensive and complicated by design,&nbsp;and it’s the limiting factor&nbsp;of the sexual fulfillment of men.&nbsp;Women impose costs on men to gain sexual access for very good reasons: to test their genetic fitness and their long-term potential supporting a&nbsp;family. If courtship is costly and the costs are not clearly defined, this not only tests a man’s motivation toward a specific woman, it also acts to monopolize a man’s resources so he can’t afford to woo anyone else. Pornography and prostitution are popular because they arrive at sexual end goals, or a reasonable facsimile, with more clarity and lower costs than in the mating market.</p>



<p>The complications of courtship are driving improvements in sexual substitutes, like masturbation aids (e.g. fleshlight, fliphole) and 3-D&nbsp;porn. There are already thousands of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealDoll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RealDolls </a>in the world, silicone sex dolls that cost around $6,000 each.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LovePlus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>LovePlus</em>&nbsp;</a>is a Japanese game in which players interact with a virtual girlfriend including kissing her by touching the screen and taking her out on dates, has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/video-game-girlfriend-loveplus-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of thousands of users</a>.&nbsp;<em>LovePlus</em>&nbsp;is a great demonstration of how this market&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/05/love-plus-makes-you-care-about-a-virtual-girl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t only about providing sex</a>, but also virtual companionship. You can’t even have virtual sex with Rinko, the ingénue of the game. These substitutes aren’t very good, and yet they are already competing with flesh-and-blood companionship.</p>

<p>Union&nbsp;power, increases in mandatory working standards, and minimum wage&nbsp;laws&nbsp;accelerate the push toward&nbsp;automation.&nbsp;Machines&nbsp;are already replacing cashiers&nbsp;and&nbsp;factory workers. Soon the jobs of truck drivers, clerks, and accountants&nbsp;will be automated. The current political climate around courtship and interactions between the sexes is more powerful than&nbsp;the&nbsp;market forces that are&nbsp;replacing jobs,&nbsp;because escalating costs aren’t transparent and neither is the punishment for not paying them. If a business owner wants to adhere to employment laws, he reads them. The costs of courtship are codified nowhere.</p>



<p>The average single man paying attention to&nbsp;contemporary&nbsp;social fashions&nbsp;will struggle to understand the new rules of meeting, courting, or having sex with women. Something as banal as trying to converse with a woman wearing headphones&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.askmen.com/news/dating/talking-to-women-who-are-wearing-headphones.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is now often considered harassment</a>. A man’s chances of mating success increase when he approaches many women, but so too do his chances of a gaining reputation as sexist, exploitative, or immoral. To take a fraught example, how does a man know that a woman is genuinely consenting to sex?&nbsp;A lack of ability to pick up on cues can incur catastrophic costs.</p>



<p>Men high in conscientiousness, who are sensitive to social disapproval but who nonetheless have difficulty reading subtle social cues, could make good husbands for women.&nbsp;These men are unlikely to want to take the risk of approaching women. As substitutes like sex robots and virtual companions become better and cheaper,&nbsp;they will monopolize the attention of such men.</p>



<p>Think of an introverted engineer with Asperger’s syndrome who wasn’t sure how to broach a conversation with a woman back in 2015 and definitely isn’t sure how to&nbsp;do that in today’s climate. In 10 years he could have a beautiful robot companion (indeed, he could have one that could emulate the experience of having sex with dozens of&nbsp;different&nbsp;women) that has a lower barrier to entry than the mating market and that keeps him satisfied enough to&nbsp;remain a&nbsp;happy&nbsp;bachelor. Some woman misses out on a conscientious guy with a good income who might not know exactly how to respond when she says “nothing’s wrong,” but will definitely keep the cars tuned up to get the kids to their mathematics championships. The world might miss out on his sons and daughters and their analytical approaches to some of the world’s problems.</p>



<p>The kinds of men described above, who have difficulty reading social signals but who are nonetheless strongly sexually motivated, have a characteristic that means&nbsp;they’ll be less put off by sex robots than the average person: resistance to perceiving the uncanny valley. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The uncanny valley</a>” is the way that representations that fall just short of looking like humans&nbsp;<a href="https://www.strangerdimensions.com/2013/11/25/10-creepy-examples-uncanny-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often look “creepy.”</a>&nbsp;Anthropomorphized robots are more relatable and trustworthy than machine-like robots. It’s also difficult to imagine that many people would want to have sex with a conglomeration of gears and wheels.</p>



<p>My view is that&nbsp;the uncanny valley&nbsp;is something analogous to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capgras delusion</a>,&nbsp;a psychological disorder that causes sufferers to believe that someone&nbsp;they&nbsp;know has been taken over by an imposter,&nbsp;often inhuman. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/vilayanur_ramachandran_on_your_mind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VS Ramachandran</a>, there are two aspects to recognizing faces: the identification of the external familiar representation and the “internal” validation – the warm emotion that goes along with it. In the uncanny valley, you recognize a robot as humanlike, but it’s missing the facial movement or some other characteristic that gives you a warm feeling of recognition. Many men won’t experience the uncanny valley, especially with regards to sex robots. These men are going to be the early adopters. Men are worse at identifying faces than women and are far more likely to have&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prosopagnosia</a>, the inability to recognize faces.</p>



<p>Sex is weird.&nbsp;Sex is&nbsp;gross&nbsp;and awkward.&nbsp;Natural selection addressed this issue by causing arousal to attenuate the&nbsp;human&nbsp;disgust response. It’s worth noting that men have&nbsp;a&nbsp;much lower&nbsp;baseline&nbsp;sexual disgust than women,&nbsp;and that sexual excitement&nbsp;further reduces&nbsp;disgust sensitivity in men.&nbsp;In a&nbsp;<a href="http://people.duke.edu/~dandan/webfiles/PapersPI/Sexual%20Arousal%20and%20Decision%20making.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">classic paper</a>&nbsp;by Dan Ariely,&nbsp;aroused men&nbsp;had much more positive attitudes about all kinds of unusual sexual acts.&nbsp;Sexually aroused men were&nbsp;more likely to say&nbsp;that it would be fun to watch a woman urinating or that they could imagine getting sexually excited by contact with an animal). 3-D pornography of video game or cartoon characters that might be creepy in a nonsexual context are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/news/daily-glixel-people-were-thirsty-for-overwatch-zelda-porn-in-2017-w515316/the-top-video-game-porn-searches-of-2017-w515317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular genres</a>. The most direct evidence that men won’t be put off by uncanny vulvas is from a&nbsp;<a href="http://faculty.utrgv.edu/zhixiang.chen/cs6174/papers/Strait_paper2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>&nbsp;that laments the “unabashed sexualization of female-gendered robots” in comments on YouTube&nbsp;videos of&nbsp;robots.&nbsp;Bawdy comments&nbsp;on gynoids&nbsp;– “you’ll have to replace it monthly due to semen corrosion,”&nbsp;for example&nbsp;– were more frequent than comments expressing unease.</p>



<p>Perhaps&nbsp;we should encourage&nbsp;some men&nbsp;to use sex robots. Men who get&nbsp;environmental&nbsp;cues that they’re evolutionary dead-ends disproportionately menace society.

Polygynous societies in which wealthier men have access to multiple women are more violent and less stable because they have a class of young men without the prospect of getting a mate.

Our rotating cast of six drilled tones and measure words every Wednesday for about two years, in the 2nd Street WeWork, just south of Market Street in San Francisco.</p><p id="200a">Our teacher was a guy from Beijing named <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/dennis-language-services-san-francisco" rel="noopener">Dennis Zhu</a>. I got to know Dennis pretty well, and in many ways, he’s a stereotypical Boomer — mid-60s, kids in their 30s, west San Francisco house bought 20 years ago for peanuts — except he’d grown up in China. No doubt, the ’60s in the US were bad — assassinations, riots, Vietnam—but it’s a daytime sitcom compared to Dennis, who was forcibly moved to a farm, along with 10 million other “urban intellectual youth”, to play the harmonica and chop wood. They called it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_to_the_Countryside_Movement" rel="noopener">Down to the Countryside Movement</a>, only one part of the larger Cultural Revolution, that among other things included book burnings, mass executions, and the complete annihilation of land titles in large parts in China.</p><p id="399c">Big resettlements like this mark a generation. Fifty years on, Dennis can still tell you where he went, how he felt, and how pointless and futile the whole thing felt.</p><p id="2b6f">And here we are, somewhere in the middle (?) of the American COVID outbreak. My wife and I took a month or two off after Amelia, our first daughter, was born in early April, but the search for childcare has been difficult — reduced capacity at day cares, and a tight market for nanny share. With Caroline working remotely and me getting Dials up and running, we packed our bags and headed to my parents place in Homewood, the town of my childhood. Three generations sit down to dinner each night, and my parents couldn’t be happier.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="f055">Thus, our migration —the Down to the Suburbs Movement — or whatever we end up calling it. A forced migration, of maybe 100,000 (?) people, brought upon us not by politics, but by disease. The urban intellectual gentry, with our degrees, and money, and jobs in law / tech / finance.</p><p id="a9d9"><a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/10/26/developing-the-underdeveloped" rel="noopener">“Intellectual strip-mining”</a>. That’s what some call the hiring practices of the Goldman Sachs, the Googles, the DLA Pipers: showing up at the best universities across the country, grabbing the best-educated, most driven talent, and shuttling them off to well-paid jobs in glass high-rises in Denver, San Francisco, Seattle, or New York.</p><p id="48a4">And these people — I’m one of them — with my car-light lifestyle, interesting job employing novel computer vision algorithms, and successful marriage — wonder what the rest of the country “doesn’t get it”. Why someone making $12/hour at Target doesn’t want to pay yet another gas tax to get to work, living in a place without sidewalks, where the only real option is to drive.</p><p id="d2fb">The Down to the Suburbs Movement is our opportunity. A time when we can talk to our parents’ neighbors — regardless of their degrees, or what color sign they have in their yard — about how things are going.</p><p id="ede2">To many Americans, facebook is a blue square on their phone — something mystical that dropped from the sky, like calculus or the Bible — not a bunch of buildings at the end of the Dumbarton, where real people work. Ditto for Uber, Netflix, Amazon, Apple — major products, minting millionaires, profits and cashflow driving the entire S&amp;P 500. All clustered into a tiny little strip of land where shacks sell for millions and the pressure to perform is so intense, kids <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/the-silicon-valley-suicides/413140/" rel="noopener">kill themselves</a> rather than be seen as “failures”.</p><p id="69e6">If you’re in the suburbs, here are some things you might consider.</p><p id="f0cd">Get a meeting with your city’s mayor, economic development director, or anyone else you can, in the city government. Help them understand <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103832879419392" rel="noopener">Naval’s tweet</a>: “The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers.

We got tired of hearing about kids tripping on the broken asphalt, so we made drawings (my wife is an architect), borrowed money from a few friends, and managed the thing through to completion.

But every city has its strengths. I still think Chicago is the ideal site for a packaged food business accelerator. The south suburbs, where I am now, delivers an incredibly good quality of life even on $20–30k/year; that’s a major achievement in its own right, something the San Francisco Board of Supervisors could never accomplish, and the recipe for a manufacturing renaissance. The solution is playing to your strengths, not trying to out-chip or out-software Silicon Valley.</p><p id="97fc">My hope — prayer, even — is that we can use this time to spread a sense of optimism, progress, and belief that things can be better. This time won’t last forever. Try to use it well.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">



<div>
    
    
    <p><img src="https://petrovs.info/post/img/container.gif" alt="container"> Building from scratch machines with similar configuration is not very wise. Unless it’s not often. Preparing at least LXD base images would be helpful. Small routine tasks like changing the default repositories, MOTD, adding ssh keys and base tools would take more than 5 minutes per machine. 5 new machines per week, that takes a lot. To be effective, system administrators should be lazy and rational.</p>
<p>Packer from Hashi corp is really good tool for building immutable infrastructure. It supports building of different images for the cloud, on-premise environments and desktop hypervisors simultaneously.</p>
<p>LXD is a hypervisor for Linux containers and virtual machines (since version 4.0). The containers in LXD are stateful. This means that their files are persistent compared to Docker where storage mounts are necessary. Also, the  LXD containers are most likely full system virtualization. They run a full bootstrapped operating system userspace with the init system.
The key difference between LXD and LXC is that LXD is a hypervisor for LXC containers and KVM virtual machines. LXD is based on liblxc and contains REST api.</p>
<p>I won’t cover the initial configuration of LXD in this post. Packer is written in GoLang and it’s a single binary. It could be downloaded in arhive from the <a href="https://www.packer.io/downloads">official download page</a>. Alternatively, it can also be installed with <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula-linux/packer">homebrew</a>. The binary could be put in <code>/usr/local/bin</code> or in another directory of the working machine which is in the PATH.</p>
<p>The Ansible provisioner is still not compatible with the LXD builder module. There is a known bug, it hangs on “collecting artifacts” ( <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/9034">#PACKER-9034</a> ). Ansible is not getting the correct IP of the container from Packer and it’s stuck on trying to connect with SSH.</p>
<p>A workaround is using the <code>ansible-local</code> provisioner. The difference is that the Ansible runs locally inside the container. It must be installed in advance with the <em>shell</em> provisioner. Now it’s not necessary to copy the playbook inside the container with <em>file</em> provisioner. <em>ansible-local</em> provisioner does it automatically and creates a temporary directory.</p>
<p>Example Packer json (<code>lxd-ansible-local.json</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"provisioners"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"type"</span>: <span>"shell"</span>,
      <span>"inline"</span>: <span>"[ \"$(ansible --version &gt; /dev/null &amp;&amp; echo ok)\" != 'ok' ] &amp;&amp; apt update &amp;&amp; apt -y install ansible || echo 'ansible already installed.'"</span>
    },
    {
      <span>"type"</span>: <span>"ansible-local"</span>,
      <span>"playbook_file"</span>: <span>"./playbook/example-playbook.yml"</span>,
      <span>"playbook_dir"</span> : <span>"./playbook"</span>
    }
  ],


  <span>"builders"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"type"</span>: <span>"lxd"</span>,
      <span>"name"</span>: <span>"acme-focal"</span>,
      <span>"image"</span>: <span>"ubuntu-daily:focal"</span>,
      <span>"output_image"</span>: <span>"acme_ubuntu-focal"</span>,
      <span>"init_sleep"</span>: <span>"10"</span>,
      <span>"publish_properties"</span>: {
        <span>"description"</span>: <span>"Focal image by ACME corp."</span>
      }
    }
  ]
}

</code></pre></div><p>Here we have the shell provisioner which is installing Ansible with bash one-liner.</p>
<p><code>"playbook_file": "./playbook/example-playbook.yml"</code> - The exact name of the playbook file to be executed;</p>
<p><code>"playbook_dir" : "./playbook"</code> - The playbook directory to be copied to the container. Have a look at the roles config in the playbook file below!;</p>
<p><code>"name": "acme-focal"</code> - Name of the started temporary container and name of the task for logging;</p>
<p><code>"image": "ubuntu-daily:focal"</code> - Our image is based on ubuntu-daily:focal ;</p>
<p><code>"output_image": "acme_ubuntu-focal"</code> - The name of our new image;</p>
<p><code>"init_sleep": "10"</code> - Seconds to sleep between launching the container and provisioning it. My DNS is slow. That’s why the value is high.</p>
<p>Example playbook (<code>./playbook/example-playbook.yml</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">---

  - <span>hosts</span>: <span>127.0.0.1</span>
    <span>connection</span>: <span>local</span>
    <span>roles</span>:
      - <span>playbook/roles/acme-firstfive</span>
</code></pre></div><p>There is nothing special here. Only the roles path is important. Packer is copying this file to the root working directory. That’s why the exact path to the role must be specified, including the playbook dir.</p>
<p><code>connection: local</code> parameter is used with <code>127.0.0.1</code> for host.</p>
<h3 id="the-whole-file-tree-is-published-herehttpscodepetrovsinfoblagopacker-lxd-demo-as-example-project">The whole file tree is published <a href="https://code.petrovs.info/blago/packer-lxd-demo">here</a> as example project.</h3>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<p>To build the project, simply run:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://code.petrovs.info/blago/packer-lxd-demo.git <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cd packer-lxd-demo

packer build lxd-ansible-local.json
</code></pre></div><p>The temporary container is deleted immediately after deployment and only the image is published. To keep the container running for debugging in case of failure, use the option <code>-on-error=abort</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">packer build -on-error<span>=</span>abort lxd-ansible-local.json
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s have a look at the demo:</p>
<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/370407"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/370407.svg" alt="asciicast"></a></p>
<h3 id="to-be-done">To be done</h3>
<p>I didn’t try the option to build LXD VM image. It should work the same way. For virtualization, the <code>--vm</code> option is passed with <code>lxd launch</code>. Probably it must be implemented in Packer unless there is an option for command line arguments to lxc. LXD VM’s use the same format and repositories as the container images. The only difference is that they are compressed qcow’s. LXD virtualization is a topic for another post.</p>
<p>There is no option for choosing LXD profiles in Packer. It’s an important feature. For example, in my home setup, <code>lxd launch</code> must receive profiles for networking and storage. There are different networks and the default configuration won’t boot.</p>
<p>Already mentioned, the Ansible provisioner currently doesn’t work with the LXD provisioner but Ansible-local is a workaround.</p>

<p>Situationen omkring coronasmitte blandt mink har nu udviklet sig til et kritisk stadie i Nordjylland.</p>
<p>Helt inde i regeringskontorerne kategoriseres situationen som meget alvorlig, og der tales om en coronavirus 2.0.</p>


<p>Derfor har regeringen besluttet, at alle minkbesætninger nu skal slås ihjel, fordi coronavirus er muteret blandt mink og har spredt sig til mennesker.</p>
<p>Det fortæller statsminister Mette Frederiksen på et pressemøde onsdag.</p>
<div><p>»I mister livsværk, som i nogle tilfælde er gået i arv igennem flere generationer. Det er en sorgens dag for jer og for alle, der arbejder i mink-erhvervet. Det er regeringen bevidst om,« siger Mette Frederiksen til minkavlerne.</p><p>En muteret coronavirus er vandret fra mink til mennesker og har siden spredt sig kraftigt blandt borgerne i Nordjylland.</p></div>
<p>Tirsdag modtog regeringen et notat fra Statens Serum Institut (SSI), som har udsat den muterede coronavirus for antistoffer.</p>


<p>Resultatet var ifølge SSI dybt bekymrende, fordi den muterede coronavirus ikke reagerede godt på antistofferne.</p>

                                            When the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration killed mink in Brovst, they had no containers for the dead mink. Therefore, they were just thrown to the ground.
                                                                <span>Foto: Private photo</span>

<p>Dermed er der risiko for, at en eventuel vaccine mod covid-19 ikke vil have den ønskede effekt, hvis den muterede virus fra mink spreder sig yderligere blandt mennesker.</p>
<p>Samtidig er bekymringen, at den nye coronavirus fra mink betyder, at alle mennesker, som har været smittet med corona, igen kan blive ramt af den muterede coronavirus.</p>
<p>Der er desuden nye restriktioner på vej for borgere i en række kommuner i det nordjyske for at stoppe spredningen af coronavirussen fra mink.</p>


<p>Det drejer sig indtil videre om kommunerne Hjørring, Frederikshavn, Brønderslev, Jammerbugt, Thisted og Læsø, oplyser Mette Frederiksen.</p>
<p>»Vi ved godt, at vi efterlader jer i Nordjylland i uvished til i morgen. Det beklager jeg. Men vi skal handle nu. Det drejer sig om liv og død ikke kun i Danmark, men i hele verden,« siger Mette Frederiksen.</p>
<p>De nye restriktioner bliver meldt ud torsdag.</p>
<p>Siden regeringen modtog det bekymrende notat fra SSI tirsdag, har man i regeringskontorerne arbejdet på højtryk for at finde ud af, hvilke restriktioner der skal til.</p>


<p>Coronavirussen har spredt sig voldsomt på de danske minkfarme siden sommer. I skrivende stund har mere end 207 minkbesætninger fået konstateret corona, og derfor skal alle disse mink aflives.</p>
<p>Men nu lyder befalingen fra Mette Frederiksen, at samtlige mink på de godt 1.100 minkfarme i Danmark skal aflives.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The most fundamental core of any business relationship is trust. Traditionally this was built through multiple interactions, which included at least in-person meeting.</p><p>It seemed that something about meeting in person helped solidify what was discussed. Whether this is through body language or both parties being able to lower their guards and speak somewhat informally.</p><p>These in-person meetings have been a staple for long-lasting business relationships. However, the ability for these type of interactions has been put on hold thanks to the current pandemic. The startup community has had to adapt to these restrictions and in my opinion, the perfect environment for entrepreneurship was created.</p><p>People with extra time on their hands and nothing to do.</p><p>While I recognize and have experienced the downsides of this pandemic from a business perspective, I try to look at the positives. This motivation is what led to my most recent startup, <a href="https://accordably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accordably, which is a competitor monitoring solution</a>.</p><h2><strong>How do you find a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>Alright, great, you want to start a business, but how do you actually find a cofounder?</p><p>I wish I could tell you that this was the easy part, but it’s actually probably the hardest.</p><p>It’s going to be a lot of trial and error.</p><p>We are in more restricted social times, so it becomes even more difficult. A good place to start is with previous colleagues that you’ve worked with. You know them from a professional perspective, you’ve seen how they act with colleagues and their work ethic.</p><p>Remember, the stakes are much higher when it’s your own business, so these favourable employee working traits don’t always translate into a good cofounder.</p><p>Personally, I would recommend checking out different digital communities, you’d be surprised who you’ll meet and might find someone that has very similar goals to you.</p><p>My personal favourite community is Indie Hackers. They have a specific group called <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/looking-to-partner-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Looking to partner up”</a> and you will find a wide variety of people looking to start a business.</p><p>I am biased as that’s where I met the cofounder of Accordably.</p><h2><strong><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" alt="Remote cofounders of Accordably" width="1279" height="356" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w"></strong></h2><h2><strong>What to look for when choosing a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>The ideal match is someone who is the complete opposite of your skillset. Think of it like an ice hockey team. If your team was all goalies, you’d get nowhere. You need balance and different strengths to help push your product over the top.</p><p>Now one thing that shouldn’t be the complete opposite is your motivation. Finding someone who has the same drive is important or else there could be a growing resentment in your near future.</p><p>No two situations are the same and this is why it’s difficult to find a cofounder. There needs to be the right mix of similar professional goals and differing skillsets to build a strong tandem.</p><p>Another important attribute is whether you can see yourself getting along with this person from a social perspective. Face it, you’re going to have to spend a lot of time speaking with this person and planning out the future of your business.</p><p>There are some personality types that just don’t mix. Even if your skillsets are the perfect match, your mental health could be at risk if find yourself in a toxic work relationship.</p><p>For me, building a startup isn’t necessarily about the money (I mean it helps of course!) but it’s an outlet where my voice has a direct impact on the future of the business. I can test out crazy ideas and not worry about angry investors or upsetting management.</p><h2><strong>How to build trust when you’ve never met?</strong></h2><p>Just because you meet somebody in person doesn’t automatically create trust. Everyone has their own problems and you’ll never truly understand all the factors that go into their decisions.</p><p>So how do you build trust?</p><p>Time.</p><p>It takes time to build trust, you need to learn each others working habits, personalities and goals. After 2 weeks of working together, you should have a good understanding of the other person.</p><p>Of course, 2 weeks isn’t enough to jump into anything long term, but it will give you a good idea of direction and at that point, you can choose whether or not to continue.</p><p>While you should protect yourself, there’s no need to waste money on lawyers right at the start. Just write up a basic agreement that lays out your agreed upon terms and that you will revisit at a later stage.</p><p>Even with an agreement created by lawyers, you can get screwed over, so don’t worry about this too much at the start.</p><h2><strong>Finding the right idea</strong></h2><p>You’ve assembled a strong team, your skills match perfectly and you’re ready to go, but you’re missing one thing.</p><p>The idea!</p><p>This is difficult because whatever you choose you will be committing a large chunk of time to it, so you don’t want to make the wrong choice and get startup remorse.</p><p>Now I can’t stress this enough, no matter what you choose, make sure that it genuinely interests you. I’ve been in many situations that after the initial sparkle of an idea wears off, I’m stuck with a product that I find soul-crushingly boring.</p><p>The product may make money, but if you don’t enjoy it, it’s not worth it.</p><p>The approach that we took was rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis, we just started with something.</p><p>We started working on a server-side web analytics solution and testing the market on this idea. We focused on building the infrastructure and easily transferable parts that we could use for other ideas.</p><p>After about a month of building, two things happened:</p><ol><li>We had enough time to see if our working styles meshed, which they did.</li><li>An idea popped up from a client request that we both believed in.</li></ol><p>Long story short, instead of beating your head against a wall trying to find the perfect idea, <strong>just start! </strong></p><p>Start with anything, inspiration will come, staying stagnant will just make you another wantrepreneur.</p><h2><strong>Maintaining communication</strong></h2><p>When it comes to remote cofounders the importance of communication is multiplied. Setting up the proper channels and maintaining a clear schedule is critical for success.</p><p>Keeping your teammate informed of your daily/weekly goals helps motivate and set accountability.</p><p>It’s very easy to procrastinate when you’re “the boss” but when you see your cofounder working their ass off and you’re doing nothing, that guilt should set in. Unless of course, you’re a prick.</p><p>Our main communication hub is Slack and we have integrated all of our tools to send notifications to this platform. This is our main dashboard and it helps keeps us on the same page for the health of the business.</p><p>Figure out what works for your duo and run with it. For us, we will have one or two calls a week and then for the smaller topics, just send each other audios clips.</p><p>This style has worked for us because when a thought is fresh, you can send a quick audio snippet and the other can listen to it when they have time.</p><p>Getting sidetracked is a big problem, so try to stay on goal and not overcommunicate with long phone calls every day.</p><p>One piece of advice that I can share when it comes to communication is that tone is not conveyed properly over text. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen people get upset over an email or Slack message from a misunderstanding in tone.</p><p>In this digital world, don’t forget how to communicate. Jumping to conclusions or negatives will just set your team back. Clarify before making an unnecessary enemy.</p><h2><strong>Trust your gut</strong></h2><p>There is no one size fits all formula to finding a cofounder. People aren’t predictable. It takes time to find the right fit.</p><p>The one constant is your gut because no matter who you choose, you’re going to have to take a chance.</p><p>You could get burned or feel like you’re doing all the work, that’s just collateral damage in the life of an entrepreneur.</p><p>All that you can do is work with the information you’re given and decide if you believe in your cofounder. When it works, it works and you’ll eventually see success.</p><p>That’s what we’re working towards with Accordably and we’re excited to see what’s next for this project.</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>These are my notes after learning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a> algorithm.
The primary goal here is to sharpen my own understanding of the algorithm, but maybe someone will find this explanation of Paxos useful!
This post assumes fluency with mathematical notation.</p>


<p>That means that I didn’t actually understand the algorithm.</p>
<p>What finally made the whole thing click are</p>

<p>I now think that the thing is actually much simpler than it is made to believe :-)</p>
<p>Buckle in, we are starting!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what-is-paxos"><a href="#what-is-paxos"></a>What is Paxos?</h2>
<div>
<p>Paxos is an algorithm for implementing distributed consensus.
Suppose you have <code>N</code> machines which communicate over a faulty network.
The network may delay, reorder, and lose messages (it can not corrupt them though).
Some machines might die, and might return later.
Due to network delays, “machine is dead” and “machine is temporary unreachable” are indistinguishable.
What we want to do is to make machines agree on some value.
“Agree” here means that if some machine says “value is X”, and another machine says “value is Y”, then X necessary is equal to Y.
It is OK for machine to answer “I don’t know yet”.</p>
<p>The problem with this formulation is that Paxos is an elementary, but subtle algorithm.
To understand it (at least for me), a precise, mathematical formulation is needed.
So, let’s try again.</p>
<p>What is Paxos?
Paxos is a theorem about sets!
This is definitely mathematical, and is true (as long as you base math on set theory), but is not that helpful.
So, let’s try again.</p>
<p>What is Paxos?
Paxos is a theorem about nondeterministic state machines!</p>
<p>A system is characterized by a state.
The system evolves in discrete steps: each step takes system from <code>state</code> to <code>state'</code>.
Transitions are non-deterministic: from a single current <code>s1</code>, you may get to different next states <code>s2</code> and <code>s3</code>.
(non-determinism models a flaky network).
An infinite sequence of system’s states is called a behavior:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>state_0 → state_1 → ... → state_n → ...
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Due to non-determinism, there’s a potentially infinite number of possible behaviors.
Nonetheless, depending on the transition function, we might be able to prove that some condition is true for any state in any behavior.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example, and also introduce some notation.
I won’t use TLA+, as I don’t enjoy its concrete syntax.
Instead, math will be set in monospaced unicode.</p>
<p>The example models an integer counter.
Each step the counter decrements or increments (non-deterministically), but never gets too big or too small</p>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<p>The sate of the system is a single variable — <code>counter</code>.
It holds a natural number.
In general, we will represent a state of any system by a fixed set of variables.
Even if the system logically consists of several components, we model it using a single unified state.</p>
<p>The <code>Init</code> formula specifies the initial state, the <code>counter</code> is zero.
Note that <code>=</code> is a mathematical equality, and not an assignment.
<code>Init</code> is a <em>predicate</em> on states.</p>
<p><code>Init</code> is true for <code>{counter: 0}</code>.<br>
<code>Init</code> is false for <code>{counter: 92}</code>.</p>
<p><code>Next</code> defines a non-deterministic transition function.
It is a predicate on pairs of states, <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>.
<code>counter</code> is a variable in the <code>s1</code> state, <code>counter'</code> is the corresponding variable in the <code>s2</code> state.
In plain English, transition from <code>s1</code> to <code>s2</code> is valid if one of these is true:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s1</code> is less than <code>9</code> and value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s2</code> is greater by 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s1</code> is greater than <code>0</code>, and value of <code>counter</code> in <code>s2</code> is smaller by 1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><code>Next</code> is true for <code>({counter: 5}, {counter: 6})</code>.<br>
<code>Next</code> is false for <code>({counter: 5}, {counter: 5})</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some behaviors of this system:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 0 → 1 → 0 → 1</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here are some <strong>non</strong> behaviors of this system:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5</code>: <code>Init</code> does not hold for initial state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 2</code>: <code>Next</code> does not hold for <code>(0, 2)</code> pair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0 → 1 → 0 → -1</code>: <code>Next</code> does not hold for <code>(0, -1)</code> pair</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>“behavior” means that the initial state satisfies <code>Init</code>, and each transition satisfies <code>Next</code>.</p>
<p>We can state and prove a theorem about this system: for every state in every behavior, the value of counter is between 0 and 9.
Proof is by induction:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The condition is true in the initial state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the condition is true for state <code>s1</code>, and <code>Next</code> holds for <code>(s1, s2)</code>, then the condition is true for <code>s2</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QED.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As usual with induction, sometimes we would want to prove a <em>stronger</em> property, because it gives us more powerful base for an induction step.</p>
<p>To sum up, we define a non-deterministic state machine using two predicates <code>Init</code> and <code>Next</code>.
<code>Init</code> is a predicate on states which restricts possible initial states.
<code>Next</code> is a predicate on <em>pairs</em> of states, which defines a non-deterministic transition function.
<code>Vars</code> section describes the state as a fixed set of typed variables.
<code>Sets</code> defines auxiliary fixed sets, elements of which are values of variables.
<code>Theorem</code> section specifies a predicate on behaviors: <em>sequences</em> of steps evolving according to <code>Init</code> and <code>Next</code>.</p>
<p>The theorem does not automatically follow from <code>Init</code> and <code>Next</code>, it needs to be proven.
Alternatively, we can simulate a range of possible behaviors on a computer and check the theorem for the specific cases.
If the set of reachable states is small enough (finite would be a good start), we can enumerate <em>all</em> behaviors and produce a brute force proof.
If there are too many reachable states, we can’t prove the theorem this way, but we often can prove it to be wrong, by finding a counter example.
This is the idea behind model checking in general and TLA+ specifically.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what-is-consensus"><a href="#what-is-consensus"></a>What is Consensus?</h2>
<div>
<p>Having mastered the basic vocabulary, let’s start slowly building towards Paxos.
We begin with defining what consensus is.
As this is math, we’ll do it using sets.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
</pre></td><td><pre>Sets:
  𝕍 -- Arbitrary set of values

Vars:
  chosen ∈ 2^𝕍 -- Subset of values

Theorem:
    ∀ i: |chosen_i| ≤ 1
  ∧ ∀ i, j: i ≤ j ∧ chosen_i ≠ {} ⇒ chosen_i = chosen_j

-- Notation
-- {}:  empty set
-- 2^X: set of all subsets of X, powerset
-- |X|: cardinality (size) of the set
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The state of the system is a set of chosen values.
For this set to constitute consensus (over time) we need two conditions to hold:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>at most one value is chosen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if we choose a value at one point in time, we stick to it (math friendly: any two chosen values are equal to each other)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here’s the simplest possible implementation of consensus:</p>
<div>
<p>Consensus</p>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8

</pre></td><td><pre>Sets:
  𝕍 -- Arbitrary set of values

Vars:
  chosen ∈ 2^𝕍 -- Subset of values

Init ≡
  chosen = {}

Next ≡
  chosen = {} ∧ ∃ v ∈ 𝕍: chosen' = {v}


Theorem:
    ∀ i: |chosen_i| ≤ 1
  ∧ ∀ i, j: i ≤ j ∧ (chosen_i ≠ {} ⇒ chosen_i = chosen_j)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the initial state, the set of chosen values is empty.
We can make a step if the current set of chosen values is empty, in which case we select an arbitrary value.</p>
<p>This technically breaks our behavior theory: we require behaviors to be infinite, but, for this spec, we can only make a single step.
The fix is to allow empty steps: a step which does not change the state at all is always valid.
We call such steps “stuttering steps”.</p>
<p>The proof of the first condition of the consensus theorem is a trivial induction.
The proof of the second part is actually non-trivial, here’s a sketch.
Assume that <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are indices, which violate the condition.
They might be far from each other in state-space, so we can’t immediately apply <code>Next</code>.
So let’s choose the <em>smallest</em> <code>j1 ∈ [i+1;j]</code> such that the condition is violated.
Let <code>i1 = j1 - 1</code>.
The condition is still violated for <code>(i1, j1)</code> pair, but this time they are subsequent steps, and we can show that <code>Next</code> does not hold for them, concluding the proof.</p>
<p>Yay! We have a distributed consensus algorithm which works for 1 (one) machine:</p>
<div>
<p>Distributed Consensus For One Machine</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick arbitrary value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="simple-voting"><a href="#simple-voting"></a>Simple Voting</h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s try to extend this to a truly distributed case, where we have <code>N</code> machine (“acceptors”).
We start with formalizing the naive consensus algorithm: let acceptors vote for values, and select the value which gets a majority of votes.</p>
<div>
<p>Majority Vote</p>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

</pre></td><td><pre>Sets:
  𝕍 -- Arbitrary set of values
  𝔸 -- Finite set of acceptors

Vars:
  votes ∈ 2^(𝔸×𝕍) -- Set of (acceptor, value) pairs

Init ≡
  votes = {}

Next ≡
  ∃ a ∈ 𝔸:
      ∃ v ∈ V: votes' = votes ∪ {(a, v)}
    ∧ ∀ v ∈ V: (a, v) ∉ votes

chosen ≡
  {v ∈ V: |{a ∈ 𝔸: (a, v) ∈ votes}| &gt; |𝔸| / 2}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The state of the system is the set of all votes cast by all acceptors.
We represent a vote as a pair of an acceptor and the value it voted for.
Initially, the set of votes is empty.
On each step, some acceptor casts a vote for some value (adds <code>(a, v)</code> pair to the set of votes), but only if it hasn’t voted yet.
Remember that <code>Next</code> is a predicate on pairs of states, so we check <code>votes</code> for existing vote, but add a new one to <code>votes'</code>.
The value is chosen if the set of acceptors which voted for the value (<code>{a ∈ 𝔸: (a, v) ∈ votes}</code>) is at least half as large as the set of all acceptors.
In other words, if a majority of acceptors has voted for the value.</p>

<p>Let’s prove consensus theorem for Majority Vote protocol.
TYPE ERROR, DOES NOT COMPUTE.
The consensus theorem is a predicate on behaviors of states consisting of <code>chosen</code> variable.
Here, <code>chosen</code> isn’t a variable, <code>votes</code> is!
<code>chosen</code> is a function which maps current state to some boolean.</p>
<p>While it is intuitively clear what “consensus theorem” would look like for this case, let’s make this precise.
Let’s <em>map</em> states with <code>votes</code> variable to states with <code>chosen</code> variable using the majority rule, <code>f</code>.
This mapping naturally extends to a mapping between corresponding behaviors (sequences …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Optimizing SQL queries can be done in many ways, but the current case that I am going to show you is a little bit different.</p>



<p>Last week my direct manager asked me to see why a list of data loads very slow. Also, if it was possible, to optimize it. &nbsp;The data set consisted of around 1000 rows. The load time for all rows was about 7 seconds. Even though each row was an elaborate business entity, that did not justify the load time. As every sane developer could see, there was something wrong.</p>



<p>We are using Entity Framework, so I started looking at the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LINQ</a> statement. It was a complex statement with a lot of joins. Also, the statement had some dynamic query building. But these things were not the problem.</p>



<p>A few lines below, I saw several fat subqueries. They also had many joins, filters end, etc. But the most “exciting” part was that they were the same. They only differed by a single where clause.</p>



<p>(simplified pseudo-code example)</p>



<pre>from organization in organisations
joinâ€¦
joinâ€¦
joinâ€¦
joinâ€¦
whereâ€¦
select
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¦ other fields
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PPartners = (very complex query with
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        WHERE p.Type == Type.Primary).ToList(),

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SPartners = (very complex query with
&nbsp;                 WHERE p.Type == Type.Secondary).ToList(),

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;OPartners = (very complex query with
&nbsp;&nbsp;                WHERE p.Type == Type.Other).ToList()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
} </pre>



<p>I instantly understood that I had found the problem. I removed the subqueries to test how the load time will change. It dropped under a second.</p>



<p>Abstracting the sub queries slow execution time, you can imagine how big was the flattened dataset transferred from the SQL server.</p>



<h2><strong>Optimizing SQL queries or “Devide et impera”</strong></h2>



<p>In some cases, SQL query optimization will not help you. Yes, you can try to squeeze another 100 milliseconds using various technics, but you will hit a brick wall sooner or later.</p>



<p>Some of you will say that queries like these are avoidable with better DB design. I agree to some extent. As you know, we cannot predict everything or optimize for everything.</p>



<p>So, what was the solution that I introduced? I extracted the subqueries into a single query without any filtering (I pulled the data for all the partners). When I had both datasets loaded into the memory, I built the proper object that I needed.</p>



<p>Before doing this, I ensured that the datasets’ maximum size could not be more than a couple of thousands of rows!</p>



<p>After that <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/02/15/what-is-code-refactoring/">refactoring</a>, the load time dropped to a second and a half. Could I make it faster? Sure! <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/06/29/software-development-is-about-being-effective-and-efficient/">Is it worth it</a>? At this point, no.</p>



<p>In short â€“ sometimes it is much better to split your queries into two or even several ones.</p>



<p>When you find yourself writing a very complex query getting “everything” from the DB, think about this case.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Earlier this week, security researcher Ryan Castellucci published a blog post with a somewhat provocative title: <em><a href="https://rya.nc/dkim-privates.html">DKIM: Show Your Privates</a></em>.</p>



<p>After reading the ensuing discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24972609">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104135629/https://old.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/jmv4qd/dkim_show_your_privates/gb0h87a/?context=9">Reddit</a> about their DKIM post, it seems clear that the importance of <strong>deniability</strong> in online communications seems to have been broadly overlooked.</p>



<h2>Security Goals, Summarized</h2>







<p>When you design or implement any communications protocol, you typically have most or all of the following security goals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Only the intended recipients can understand the contents of a message (almost always achieved through encryption).</li><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: The message will be delivered without alterations; and if it is, the recipient will know to reject it.</li><li><strong>Availability</strong>: Authorized users will have access to the resources they need (i.e. a medium they can communicate through).</li></ul>



<p>However, you may also have one or more of the following security goals:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: In a group communication protocol, you want to ensure you can validate which participant sent each message. This is loosely related to, yet independent from, integrity.</li><li><strong>Non-Repudiation</strong>: An extension of authenticity, wherein you cannot deny that you sent a message after you sent it; it’s provable that you sent it.</li><li><strong>Deniability:</strong> The complement to non-repudiation, wherein you can prove that you sent a message to your recipient, and then at a future time make it possible for other participants to have forged the message.</li></ul>



<p>It’s tempting to think of deniability as the opposite of non-repudiation, but in practice, you want messages to have authenticity for <em>at least</em> a brief period of time for both.</p>



<p>However, you cannot simultaneously have deniability and non-repudiation in a communication. They’re mutually exclusive concepts, even if they both build off authenticity. Hence, I call it a complement.</p>



<p>Off-The-Record messaging achieved deniability through publishing the signing key of the previous message with each additional message.</p>



<h2>Security Properties of DKIM</h2>



<p><a href="https://rya.nc/dkim-privates.html">Ryan Castellucci’s blog post</a> correctly observed that the anti-spam protocol DKIM, as used by most mail providers in 2020, incidentally also offers non-repudiation…even if that’s not <em>supposed to be</em> a primary goal of DKIM.</p>



<p>Non-repudiation can be bolted onto any protocol with long-term asymmetric cryptographic keys used to generate digital signatures of messages–which is exactly what DKIM does.</p>



<h3>Real World Case Study</h3>



<p>A while ago, the New York Post published a DKIM-signed email from someone claiming to be named Vadym Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden–son of the presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. </p>



<p>Because the DKIM public keys used by Gmail during that time period are known–but <em>not</em> the private keys–it’s possible to authenticate that the emails came from Gmail and is a valid email. And someone <a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/hunter-dkim">did exactly this</a>.</p>



<p>In a similar vein, if someone wanted to embarrass an executive at a large company, accessing their colleagues’ email and leaking messages would be sufficient, since DKIM could be used to verify that the emails are authentic.</p>



<h3>Deniability in DKIM</h3>



<p>Ryan’s proposal for introducing deniability in DKIM was to routinely rotate signing keys and publish fragments of their old DKIM private keys (which are RSA keys) so that anyone can reconstruct the private key after-the-fact.</p>



<p>This kind of deniability is mostly to mitigate against the harm of data leaks–such as your friend’s laptop getting stolen and someone trying to lambaste you on social media for an email you sent 10+ years ago–rather than provide a legal form of deniability. (We’re cryptography nerds, not lawyers.)</p>



<p>If the laptop theft scenario took place, with DKIM, someone can cryptographically <strong>prove</strong> you sent the email at a specific time to your friend with a specific body, because it’s signed by (presumably Gmail’s) DKIM keys.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you had used an email provider that practiced what Ryan proposed (rotating/publishing the private key at a regular interval), they couldn’t cryptographically prove anything. If the past private keys are public, anyone could have come along and forged the DKIM signature.</p>



<h2>On Post-Compromise Security</h2>



<p>The concept of <strong>Post-Compromise Security</strong> is somewhat related to deniability (but affects confidentiality rather than integrity or authenticity):</p>



<p>If someone successfully compromises one participant in a private discussion group, and their access is discovered, can the rest of the participants recover from this breach and continue to have privacy for future conversations?</p>



<p>It’s easy to see how the concepts are related.</p>



<ul><li>Deniability offers short-term authenticity followed by a long-term break in authenticity.</li><li>Post-Compromise Security offers long-term confidentiality even if there’s a short-term break in confidentiality.</li></ul>



<p>Robust private messaging protocols–such as what the IETF is trying to provide with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-protocol/">Message Layer Security</a>–would ideally offer both properties to their users.</p>



<p>Past attempts to build non-repudiation (through “message franking”) on top of cipher constructions like <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM</a> led to a class of attacks known affectionately as Invisible Salamanders, based on the title of the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">relevant research paper</a>.</p>



<h2>In Conclusion</h2>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apropos of nothing, I really wish Gmail would start publishing its expired DKIM secret keys.</p>— Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1323011619069321216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>It might seem really weird for cryptographers to want large-scale email providers to publish their expired DKIM secret keys, but when you understand the importance of deniability in past private communications, it’s a straightforward thing to want.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting: Some security experts will push back on this, because they work in computer forensics, and making DKIM deniable would theoretically make their job slightly more difficult. </p>



<p>Keep their self-interest in mind when they’re complaining about this notion, since the proposal is <strong>not</strong> to publish non-expired DKIM secret keys, and therefore it would not make spam more challenging to combat.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>This is the second in a series of posts in which we share how you can use eBPF to debug applications without recompilation / redeployment. The <a href="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/blog/ebpf-function-tracing/post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first post</a> provided a short introduction to eBPF and demonstrated how to use it to write a simple function argument tracer. In this second post, we will look at how to use eBPF to capture HTTP 1.X traffic.</p><p>Gaining visibility into HTTP traffic is valuable when working with distributed applications. This data can be used for performance, functional and security monitoring. Many applications accomplish this by utilizing middleware to add tracing or logging to HTTP requests in the application. One can also utilize popular open source frameworks like <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Telemetry</a> to instrument requests and related context. In this post, we will take a look at an alternative approach that utilizes eBPF to capture HTTP data without having to manually add instrumentation. One advantage of this approach is that it always works, even if applications have not been specifically instrumented.</p><p><a href="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/blog/ebpf-function-tracing/post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 1</a> of this series provides a more detailed overview of eBPF, which allows you to run restricted C code upon some trigger event. Kprobes provide a mechanism to trace the Kernel API or internals and uprobes provide a mechanism to intercept specific instructions in a user program. Since applications typically sit on top of the Kernel system API, if we capture the Kernel interface we should be able to capture all the ingress and egress data and reconstruct the HTTP requests.</p><p>Alternatively, we can use uprobes to carefully instrument underlying HTTP libraries (eg. net/http in Go) to capture HTTP requests directly. Since uprobes work at the application level, their implementation will be dependent on the underlying language used.</p><p>This post will explore tracing HTTP requests using both kprobes and uprobes and compare the tradeoffs for each.</p><h2>What happens during an HTTP request?</h2><p>Before we start writing any BPF code, let’s try to understand how HTTP requests are handled by the system. We will utilize the same <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/app/app.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test application</a> we used in Part 1, a simple Golang HTTP server (simpleHTTP), however the results are generalizable to other HTTP applications.
The first step is to understand what Linux kernel APIs are used to send and receive data for a simple HTTP request.</p><p>We can use the Linux <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perf</a> command to understand what system calls are invoked:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Using <code>curl</code>, we’ll make a simple HTTP request in another terminal window:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Back in the original terminal window, where the <code>perf</code> command is running, you should see a spew of data:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Note that we took care not to have any additional print statements in our <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/app/app.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app.go</a> simple Golang HTTP server to avoid creating extra system calls.</p><p>Examining the output of the <code>perf</code> call shows us that there are 3 relevant system calls: <code>accept4</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>close</code>. Tracing these system calls should allow us to capture all of the data the server is sending out in response to a request.</p><p>From the server’s perspective, a typical request flow is shown below, where each box represents a system call. The Linux system call API is typically much more complex than this and there are other variants that can be used. For the purposes of this post we assume this simplified version, which works well for the application that we are tracing.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/e9171b519eb9bd5e8cb37a3750e16f2d/http-request-flow-syscalls.png"><figcaption>System call flow for an HTTP request.</figcaption></figure></div><p>While the focus of this example is on tracing the HTTP response, it is also possible to trace the data sent in the HTTP request by adding a probe to the <code>read</code> syscall.</p><h2>Tracing with Kprobes</h2><p>Now that we know that tracing <code>accept4</code>, <code>write</code> and <code>close</code> are sufficient for this binary, we can start constructing the BPF source code. Our program will roughly look like the following:</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/351711bdbe0647329de98bc9574ed4bc/kprobe-tracing.png"><figcaption>Diagram of our eBPF HTTP tracer using kprobes.</figcaption></figure></div><p>There is some additional complexity in the implementation in order to avoid limitations in eBPF (stacksize, etc.), but at a high level, we need to capture the following using 4 separate probes:</p><ul><li><strong>Entry to <code>accept4</code></strong>: The entry contains information about the socket. We store this socket information</li><li><strong>Return from <code>accept4</code></strong>: The return value for accept4 is the file descriptor. We store this file descriptor in a BPF_MAP.</li><li><strong>Entry to <code>write</code></strong>: The write function gives us information about the file descriptor and the data written to that file descriptor. We write out this data to a perf buffer so the userspace tracing program can read it.</li><li><strong>Entry to <code>close</code></strong>: We use the file descriptor information to clear the BPF_MAP we allocated above and stop tracking this fd.</li></ul><p>Note that kprobes work across the entire system so we need to filter by PID to limit capturing the data to only the processes of interest. This is done for all the probes listed above.</p><p>Once the data is captured, we can read it to our Go userspace program and parse the HTTP response using the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>net/http</code></a> library.</p><p>The kprobe approach is conceptually simple, but the implementation is fairly long. You can check out the detailed code <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/http_trace_kprobe/http_trace_kprobe.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. For brevity, we left out a few details such as reading the return value from write to know how many bytes were actually written.</p><p>One downside to capturing data using kprobes is that we land up reparsing all responses since we intercept them after they have been converted to the write format. An alternative approach is to use uprobes to capture the data before it gets sent to the kernel where we can read the data before it has been serialized.</p><h2>Tracing with Uprobes</h2><p>Uprobes can be used to interrupt the execution of the program at a particular address and allow a BPF program to collect the underlying data. This capability can be used to capture data in a client library, but the underlying BPF code and addresses/offsets of interest will be dependent on the library's implementation . As a result, if there are changes in the client library, the uprobe will need to be updated as well. Therefore, it is best to add uprobes for client libraries that are unlikely to change significantly in order to minimize the number of updates we make to our uprobes.</p><p>For Go, we will try to find a tracepoint on the underlying <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>net/http</code></a> library. One approach is to directly examine the code to determine where to probe. We will show an alternate method that can be used to figure out which parts are relevant. For this, let’s run our application under <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delve</a>:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>As discussed earlier, the <code>write</code> syscall is utilized by the operating system in order to send a HTTP response. We therefore set a breakpoint there so that we can identify the underlying client code that triggers the syscall to 'write'. When we run the <code>curl</code> command again the program should interrupt. We get the backtrace using <code>bt</code>:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Examining the stack, we find that the <code>net/http.(*response).finishRequest</code> function on line 9 looks promising. The Go source code tells us that this function is invoked every time an HTTP request is completed. This function is a good spot to grab the data with uprobes for a particular request.</p><p>The capture of the data is a direct extension of our approach in Part 1. We employ the same strategy to read variables in the struct, except this time we need to chase a few pointers. The BPF code for this is documented and located <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/tree/main/demos/simple-gotracing/http_trace_uprobe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, along with the user space code required to read the recorded data.</p><p>In order to compare our two different approaches, we must consider</p><ol><li>Which probe is easier to design and implement?</li><li>Which probe is more performant?</li><li>Which probe is easier to maintain?</li></ol><p>To answer the first question, let’s look at the pros and cons of each approach.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col"></th><th scope="col">Pros</th><th scope="col">Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>kprobe</td><td><ul><li>Target language agnostic. </li><li>Simpler to implement and more maintainable. It does not rely on the implementation details of other libraries.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>The user program might split a single request across multiple system calls. </li><li>There is some complexity in re-assembling these requests. </li><li>Doesn’t work with TLS.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>uprobe</td><td><ul><li>We can access and capture application context, such as stack trace, in addition to the request itself. </li><li>We can build the uprobes to capture the data after parsing is complete, avoiding repeated work in tracer. </li><li>Works with TLS.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Sensitive to the version of the underlying library being used. </li><li>Will not function with binaries that are stripped of symbols. </li><li>Need to implement a different probe for each library (and each programming language may have its own set of libraries). </li><li>Might be hard (impossible?) with dynamic languages like Python, since  it’s hard to find the right location to probe in their underlying runtime environments. </li><li>Causes an extra system call.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Conceptually, Kprobes are the clear winner since we can avoid any language dependence to perform HTTP capture. However, this method has the added caveat that we need to reparse every response, so we should investigate whether that introduces a significant performance overhead. It is worth calling out that kprobes do not work with TLS. However, we will share our method for tracing TLS requests using eBPF in a future blog post.</p><h2>Benchmarking performance of uprobes vs. kprobes</h2><p>Since these probes will be used to monitor applications in production, we want them to have minimal overhead. On a fully loaded system, we want to understand the impact of deploying our tracers. One metric we can use to understand the performance impact is to look at the impact on the observed latency and the ability to handle high request throughput. This is not a comprehensive test and we will utilize our simple app binary to perform it. Since the probes only add overhead when the actual HTTP request is made, rather than when the request is processed, our simple binary nearly simulates the worst-case scenario.</p><p>Our experimental setup looks like:</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2ec33f85c5aef2844279c8a10d25b3f6/benchmark.png"><figcaption>Benchmark setup for comparing kprobes vs uprobes.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We utilize a modern Intel core-i9 machine with 14 physical cores to host both the load generator and the machine under test hosting the application and tracer.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A University of Cordoba and University of Cambridge study analyzed what factors in childhood and adolescence increase the likelihood of having violent behavior in adulthood</p><div>
			
<p>There is another pandemic that humans have been experiencing for a long time now and for which effective preventive measures have yet to be found: violence. This is shown in various ways in different aspects of life and continues to have serious consequences for society, the economy, our health and human relations. The onset of violent behavior can be observed from childhood and adolescence, so studying what aspects lead to the development of these kinds of behaviors and which curb them has become a necessary step in their prevention.</p>
<p>The University of Cordoba and the University of Cambridge have been collaborating for a long time now on research into aspects related to violence, thus helping decrease its risks and prevent it. In their latest piece of research, they studied possible risk and protection factors for violence and, in this way, they verified whether violent behavior can be predicted months or even years before it develops.</p>
<p>Specifically, the study focused on finding out if morality, victimization, empathy and social and emotional skills predict the expression of different violent behaviors in children and adolescents in different contexts, including at school and in a family setting. "These behaviors refer to, for instance, troubling behavior at home, including physical violence towards parents and siblings, at school, including physical violence towards teaching staff and schoolmates, and other settings, including bad behavior in public", explains Raquel Espejo Siles, doctoral student at the University of Cordoba who carried out this research during her stay at the Institute of Criminology at the University of Cambridge thanks to one of the ELMER grants from the Diputación de Córdoba (Cordoba's county government).</p>
<p>Raquel Espejo worked with Izabela Zych, Professor at the Psychology Department at the University of Cordoba and part of the LAECOVI (Study Laboratory on Coexistence and Violence Prevention) research group, whose line of research is this study's framework. The study also had the participation of David P. Farrington, Emeritus Professor of Criminology at the University of Cambridge, and Vicente J. Llorent, Professor at the Education Department at the University of Cordoba.</p>
<p>871 students between 10 and 17 years of age at different Andalusian educational centers took part in the research. They filled out two questionnaires, one in June 2017 and one in June 2018.</p>
<p>Interesting conclusions were drawn from the results. "We found that violence used directly towards people was related to a tendency to make impulsive decisions and to a blind motivation to accomplish one's aims, without regard for the disadvantages or negative consequences from using violence", reveals Raquel Espejo.</p>
<p>What is more, being a victim of bullying was detected as a risk factor for developing violent behavior at home against their family as well as at school. Likewise, those people who were violent in public or in class were shown to have higher scores in moral disengagement, meaning that they usually made excuses so that these acts would seem less serious than they really were.</p>
<p>At school, it was verified that higher scores for social and emotional competencies such as social awareness, self-management, motivation and decision making are protection factors against violence. Therefore, these results support prevention initiatives based on the potential of learning social and emotional skills at home as well as at school.</p>
<p>The data show that reducing victimization in a school setting could be effective in decreasing violence in different contexts in the future. "It is important to prevent violence, both victimization and bullying, since the data found in this study and others indicate that violence is a vicious cycle. Being the aggressor or the victim entails a high risk of developing the opposite role, reinforcing and increasing violence both at school and outside of school", points out Raquel Espejo.</p>
<p>According to this research study, enabling teenagers to reassess their goals and the consequences of their violent behavior could have an impact on decreasing violence further down the road. In addition, teaching different strategies to resolve issues in a different way could help them to compare and see the high individual and social price to pay for violent behavior.</p>
<p>This study is part of the "E-intelligence: risks and opportunities of emotional competencies expressed online" (PSI-2015-64114-R) project of the National Research, Development and Innovation Program, subsidized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Competitiveness. With the aim of having greater understanding of the reality of violence in childhood and adolescence, the team will continue to research about violent behavior in face to face and online contexts. Firstly, they have studied the factors that can curb or increase cyberhate in a study funded by the Center for Andalusian Studies. Secondly, they will continue working on the same line of research, investigating the link between bullying and drug use in a study financed by the Ministry of Health.</p>

We hope this brief exploration below could be somewhat helpful in informing you of the foundational methodology that Silver uses to forecast.</p><p>The questions we seek to answer here are:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Was Nate Silver right in 2016?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Can we even judge whether a forecaster is right or wrong?</p></li><li><p>Are elections chaotic systems that we cannot predict or controlled systems that we can?</p></li><li><p>Should forecasters incorporate the likelihood of a coup / contested elections in their models?</p></li><li><p>Do alternative facts (or truths) exist?</p></li><li><p>Do we have enough data to make predictions for someone like Trump?</p></li><li><p>… and many more</p></li></ul><p>Our co-author Michael is a math major at Princeton, and those who have contributed to this article through comments and informal conversations include professors and graduate students in economics, mathematics, and political science. We would sincerely appreciate any feedback and hope this is only the start to many exciting conversations to come.&nbsp;</p><p>When Tiger first told his parents that he’s writing a long article on the theories and applications of elections forecasting, they said: “nobody cares about your math; just tell us who the winner will be.” This is what millions of voters truly want – clarity, simplicity, and accuracy. The fact that forecasting has become so complex that it would take us pages to explore even the most fundamental concepts only shows the progress made by political scientists, but also the unnecessary over-complication of simple ideas. The result is that the public receives much more and noisier information, while their understanding of the elections has not been improved. This is a great tragedy in our opinion, and in this article we hope to simplify and deconstruct some of those debates for you.&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>What is Bayesian statistics?&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>(</strong>You may skip this technical segment if you just want to read why Nate Silver is worse than Crackhead Jim…)</p><p>Let us first set the scene. When we talk about statistical inference – the process that draws conclusions from sample data – two popular frameworks are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference"><strong>frequentist</strong></a> and <strong>Bayesian</strong> methods.</p><p>Say you want to infer what percentage of American people want to vote for Trump. Frequentists would say: I don't know what that percentage is, but I know that value is fixed, meaning that it is a number that is not random. As long as you can ask everyone (and everyone answers truthfully), you’ll get that number. You can collect some data and make your estimation, and then only two things can happen: either your estimation is consistent with the actual “true” average, or it’s not. Well, the tricky thing is that you can never really test this hypothesis out unless you literally go out there and ask every single American.&nbsp;</p><p>Bayesians would say: sure we may never be able to ask every American’s opinion of Trump, but given our polling of people around us, we may be able to assign a probability distribution to that unknown percentage we’re interested in. For instance, I would assign almost zero probability that only less than 10% of people actually want to vote for Trump (highly improbable!); and maybe I’ll assign a 52% probability for a percentage between 25% and 35%, and such and so on…</p><p><strong>So, the Bayesian method allows you to start making predictions even with very small datasets!</strong> But the true beauty of Bayesian inference doesn’t stop here – it is that <strong>you would keep updating your beliefs as you see more data.</strong> For instance, maybe the first 50 people you talked to are all liberal college kids, so you might arrive at a belief that nobody supports Trump. But as you ask more people (hopefully now some people on the Right), you’ll realize that your “prior” belief (probability distribution) was wrong, and you can update your “posterior” belief based on the conservatives you’ve just talked to. You then go ask more people; and based on how right/wrong you are, you keep updating your belief and continue down this process…</p><p>In Bayesian statistics, you assign a probability distribution to all of your unknown parameters and predictions. The way you solve a problem using Bayesian inference is, you construct some joint probability distribution for your knowns and unknowns – and then use the laws of probability to make statements about the unknowns given the knowns.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s just three things in the equation: you have a “<strong>prior</strong>” (a belief about the true average height in your mind), and a “<strong>likelihood</strong>” (what values of that true average height is consistent with the data you have) – together, they help make up the “<strong>posterior</strong>” (the updated belief about true average height in your mind). <strong>In the later part of this article, prior simply means the belief you used to have before being exposed to any new data; posterior simply means the updated belief after seeing new facts and data.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It sounds complicated, but in practice it’s an intuitive, iterative process: you already have some preconceived prior belief; you got some previous historical or new data; you go through them; you arrive at an updated posterior belief about the unknowns based on the data; you test this new belief against what you observe in reality; and based on how right/wrong you are, you update your belief and continue down this process…&nbsp;</p><p><strong>To get to the “truth,” you don't need to start with a lot of data; you just need to be willing to update your beliefs as you see more data, and update them especially strongly when something unexpected happens. </strong>You may wonder about all these “simulations” on 538 and why Silver’s predictions change every now and then – it’s because Silver keeps testing his beliefs against new data and updating his predictions. <span><strong>What Nate Silver does is a fundamentally beautiful statistical process.</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Nate Silver was right – you just don’t understand statistics&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>Nate Silver is a Bayesian, and his forecasting isn’t just popular amongst the public, but also highly regarded by many seasoned econometricians we’ve talked to. Silver’s final prediction on the 2016 election night was around 30% likelihood of Trump winning, and before then he fluctuated around 16% likelihood of Trump winning.</p><p>The side supporting Silver believes that Nate Silver wasn't wrong in 2016. We should not forget that 16% is the probability of getting a six in a die roll (or any other number), which is actually quite high.</p><p>So, the people who saw a 16% likelihood as “oh Trump is definitely going to lose" just simply didn’t understand statistics. Because of their lack of knowledge in statistics, the supporters of Silver would say, they could not grasp the true meaning of Silver’s forecast.</p><p>This is happening again in this election cycle. For the past few months, Trump has been consistently polling at below 45%, and Silver has now assigned him a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/?cid=rrpromo" target="_blank">10% probability</a> of winning at the moment. This sounds absurd to most people at first sight. The difference is just 5% of the vote – how can you drastically reduce his winnings odds to 10%?!</p><p>But if you seriously reason through the probability, Silver is correct: in a two-person game where whoever gets above 50% wins, it is entirely reasonable to assign less than a 20% chance of winning to the candidate who has consistently polled at 45% or below for months. “I think you will be surprised at how far away 45% is from 50%,” an older economics graduate student extremely knowledgable in econometrics and statistics explained to us. Assuming that the remaining 55% are with Biden, then you are asking over 7.5 million Biden/undecided supporters to suddenly change their mind on elections day. 5% sounds small, but in reality it will be a dramatic shift. </p><p>So, it is entirely mathematically sound for Silver to have made his predictions back in 2016 and today. <strong>He was right then, and he is again right today saying that Trump has a 10% likelihood of winning.</strong></p><p><span><strong>Nate Silver was NOT right – because he can never be wrong!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>Those against Silver, however, would argue that Silver’s forecast was misleading, and expecting the public to understand the nuances of probability is unrealistic. <strong>You cannot expect the American public to react to a 16% likelihood as “oh Trump actually has pretty good odds!”</strong></p><p><span><strong>But we think there’s an even more <em>philosophical</em> and deeper argument to be made here, which is that Nate Silver cannot really be right or wrong when there’s no strict standard to judge him. </strong></span></p><p>Consider the example of Crackhead Jim. Every election, he just says that the Republican candidate has a 50% chance of winning, and the Democratic candidate has a 50% chance of winning.</p><p>No matter who wins, he will argue that he’s right and a genius – if Silver’s 16% were good odds, Crackhead Jim’s 50% would be <em>amazing </em>odds. So, is Jim much better than Silver? The question remains: how do you call out Crackhead Jim for the fraud he is?</p><p>The fact that we cannot make a judgement on who's right and who's wrong for a prediction of an election is in the same way that the physics community says that the famous “String Theory” cannot be right or wrong: there's no way to verify it. Sure, the math checks off in many models for String Theory, but there’s no fundamental way to say whether it’s a good theory because we still cannot run experiments on it to prove it’s in line with reality. This is why physicists refuse to definitely conclude whether String Theory is right or wrong. (This part is Michael trying to show off his physics knowledge). </p><p>Likewise, any …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>Good things come to those who wait?</p>



<p>When I created and started hosting the first websites for curl I didn’t care about the URL or domain names used for them, but after a few years I started to think that maybe it would be cool to register a curl domain for its home. By then it was too late to find an available name under a “sensible” top-level domain and since then I’ve been on the lookout for one.</p>



<h2>Yeah, I host it</h2>



<p>So yes, I’ve administrated every machine that has ever hosted the curl web site going all the way back to the time before we called the tool curl. I’m also doing most of the edits and polish of the web content, even though I’m crap at web stuff like CSS and design. So yeah, I consider it my job to care for the site and make sure it runs smooth and that it has a proper (domain) name.</p>



<h2>www.fts.frontec.se</h2>



<p>The first ever curl web page was hosted on “<code>www.fts.frontec.se/~dast/curl</code>” in the late 1990s (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202234521/http://www.fts.frontec.se/%7Edast/curl/">snapshot</a>). I worked for the company with that domain name at the time and ~dast was the location for my own personal web content.</p>



<h2>curl.haxx.nu</h2>



<p>The curl website moved to its first “own home”, with curl.haxx.nu in August 1999 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013093821/http://curl.haxx.nu/">snapshot</a>) when we registered our first domain and the .nu top-level domain was available to us when .se wasn’t.</p>



<h2>curl.haxx.se</h2>



<p>We switched from curl.haxx.nu to curl.haxx.se in the summer of 2000 (when finally were allowed to register our name in the .se TLD) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001017164421/https://curl.haxx.se/">snapshot</a>).</p>



<p>The name “haxx” in the domain has been the reason for many discussions and occasional concerns from users and overzealous blocking-scripts over the years. I’ve kept the curl site on that domain since it is the name of one of the primary <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/sponsors.html">curl sponsors</a> and partly because I want to teach the world that a particular word in a domain is not a marker for badness or something like that. And of course because we have not bought or been provided a better alternative.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.haxx.se/">Haxx</a> is still the name of the company I co-founded back in 1997 so I’m also the admin of the domain.</p>



<h2>curl.se</h2>



<p>I’ve looked for and contacted owners of curl under many different TLDs over the years but most have never responded and none has been open for giving up their domains. I’ve always had an extra attention put on <code>curl.se</code> because it is in the Swedish TLD, the same one we have for Haxx and where I live.</p>



<h2>The curling background</h2>



<p>The first record on archive.org of anyone using the domain <code>curl.se</code> for web content is dated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030830002347/http://www.curl.se/">August 2003</a> when the Swedish curling team “Härnösands CK” used it. They used the domain and website for a few years under this name. It can be noted that it was team <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anette_Norberg">Anette Norberg</a>, which subsequently won two Olympic gold medals in the sport.</p>



<p>In September 2007 the site was renamed, still being about the sport curling but with the name “the curling girls” in Swedish (<em>curlingtjejerna</em>) which remained there for just 1.5 years until it changed again. “curling team Folksam” then populated the site with contents about the sport and that team until they let the domain expire in 2012. (Out of these three different curling oriented sites, the first one is the only one that still seems to be around but now of course on another domain.)</p>



<h2>Ads</h2>



<p>In early August 2012 the domain was registered to a new owner. I can’t remember why, but I missed the chance to get the domain then.</p>



<p>August 28 2012 marks the first date when curl.se is recorded to suddenly host a bunch of links to casino, bingo and gambling sites. It seems that whoever bought the domain wanted to surf on the good name and possible incoming links built up from the previous owners. For several years this crap was what the website showed. I doubt very many users ever were charmed by the content nor clicked on many links. It was ugly and over-packed with no real content but links and ads.</p>



<p>The last archive.org capture of the ad-filled site was done on October 2nd 2016. Since then, there’s been no web content on the domain that I’ve found. But the domain registration kept getting renewed.</p>



<h2>Failed to purchase</h2>



<p>In August 2019, I noticed that the domain was about to expire, and I figured it could be a sign that the owner was not too interested in keeping it anymore. I contacted the owner via a registrar and offered to buy it. The single only response I ever got was that my monetary offer was “too low”. I tried to up my bid, but I never got any further responses from the owner and then after a while I noticed that the domain registration was again renewed for another year. I went back to waiting.</p>



<h2>Expired again</h2>



<p>In September 2020 the domain was again up for expiration and I contacted the owner again, this time asking for a price for which they would be willing to sell the domain. Again no response, but this time the domain actually went all the way to expiry and deletion, which eventually made it available “on the market” for everyone interested to compete for the purchase.</p>



<p>I entered the race with the help of a registrar that would attempt to buy the name when it got released. When this happens, when a domain name is “released”, it becomes a race between all the potential buyers who want the domain. It is a 4-letter domain that is an English word and easy pronounceable. I knew there was a big risk others would also be trying to get it.</p>



<p>In the early morning of October 19th 2020, the curl.se domain was released and in the race of getting the purchase… I lost. Someone else got the domain before me. I was sad. For a while, until I got the good news…</p>



<h2>Donated!</h2>



<p>It turned out my friend <strong>Bartek Tatkowski</strong> had snatched the domain! After getting all the administrative things in order, Bartek graciously donated the domain to me and 15:00 on October 30 2020 I could enter my own name servers into the dedicated inputs fields for the domain, and configure it properly in our master and secondary DNS servers.</p>



<h2>curl.se is the new home</h2>



<p>Starting on November 4, 2020 <strong>curl.se is the new official home</strong> site for the curl project. The <code>curl.haxx.se</code> name will of course remain working for a long time more and I figure we can basically never shut it down as there are so many references to it spread out over the world. I intend to eventually provide redirects for most things from the old name to the new.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.fastly.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-1200x630.png" alt="" width="190" height="100" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-200x105.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-450x236.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastly-logo-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px"></a></figure></div>



<p>What about a www prefix? The jury is still out how or if we should use that or not. The initial update of the site (November 4) uses a www.curl.se host name in links but I’ve not done any automatic redirects to or from that. As the site is CDNed, and we can’t use CNAMEs on the apex domain (curl.se), we instead use anycast IPs for it – the net difference to users should be zero. (Fastly is a generous sponsor of the curl project.)</p>



<p>I also happen to own <code>libcurl.se</code> since a few years back and I’ll make sure using this name also takes you to the right place.</p>



<h2>Why not curl.dev?</h2>



<p>People repeatedly ask me. Names in the .dev domains are <em>expensive</em>. Registering <code>curl.dev</code> goes for 400 USD right now. <code>curl.se</code> costs 10 USD/year. I see little to no reason to participate in that business and I don’t think spending donated money on such a venture is a responsible use of our funds.</p>

The browser is pretty barebones and does not have a URL bar, but, once you have navigated to a page, it is fully usable. When doing a connection test in system settings, the Switch will detect that the captive portal is present and display an error for it when the response for <a href="http://conntest.nintendowifi.net/">http://conntest.nintendowifi.net/</a> does not include the <code>X-Organization: Nintendo</code> HTTP header. I can make creative use of this by pointing the Switch to a DNS server that simulates a captive portal that then redirects to a search engine.</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>System Settings</strong> and then <strong>Internet Settings</strong> and find the Wi-Fi network that your Switch is connected to. Tap <strong>Change Settings</strong>.</li><li>Find the section with the <strong>DNS Settings</strong> and add <a href="http://45.55.142.122/">45.55.142.122</a> as a new <strong>Primary DNS</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fullscreen API allows you to represent your application on the full screen. You can use it for your video player or game.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we want to present the page in the full-screen mode by clicking turn on button</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Fullscreen API<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>on<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Turn on fullscreen<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<h2 id="check-the-mode-is-supported">Check the mode is supported</h2>
<p>First, you need to check whether the full-screen mode is supported first</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> fullscreenSupported <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>fullscreenEnabled</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>It returns <code>false</code> if your browser doesn't support the full-screen mode or <code>fullscreen</code> feature is not allowed.</p>
<p>If the full-screen mode is not supported, you should show a notification for the user</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>fullscreenSupported<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> para <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"p"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  offButton<span>.</span><span>style</span><span>.</span><span>display</span> <span>=</span> <span>"none"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="get-the-current-fullscreen-element">Get the current fullscreen element</h2>
<p>You can present any element in full-screen mode. To get the current element that is being represented in full-screen, you call <code>fullscreenElement</code>&nbsp;property of <code>document</code></p>
<pre><code><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>fullscreenElement</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>It returns <code>null</code>, if the document is not in full-screen mode</p>
<h2 id="turn-on-full-screen-mode">Turn on full-screen mode</h2>
<p>You listen to the click event in the turn on button. In the event handler, you call <code>requestFullscreen()</code> of the element that you want present. It will return a <code>Promise</code> which is resolved after the full-screen mode is turned on. You need to check if the full-screen mode is supported and the mode is off.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onButton <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"on"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

onButton<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="turn-off-full-screen-mode">Turn off full-screen mode</h2>
<p>To turn off the full-screen mode, you listen to the click event of the turn off button. In the event handler, you call the <code>exitFullscreen()</code> method of <code>document</code>. It returns a <code>Promise</code> that is resolved after the mode is off. You need to check whether the mode is supported and the mode is on.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> offButton <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"off"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

offButton<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

November 4, 2020 | https://haskell.foundation/whitepaper/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://haskell.foundation/whitepaper/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><h3>Prelude</h3><p>Haskell’s slogan of “avoid success at all costs” was a clever and cheeky way of saying that
innovation and research in programming languages, especially in functional programming,
needed some insulation to succeed. Ideas that were not perfectly understood needed iteration
to fully develop in the minds of language innovators and users. By avoiding the “success at all
costs” mentality of other language communities, the Haskell community bought time and space
to try ideas that were not perfectly understood at first. Since then, the Haskell language has
sparked so many lasting innovations in language design that its impact is now beyond doubt.
What is the reason for this outsized impact? Haskell and related languages re-opened the
connection between mathematical thinking on the one hand and compilers and programming
languages on the other. It showed that these two fields should never have drifted so far apart.
By removing the ceiling on the ideas that are easier to express in Haskell, it attracted the
brightest minds and still does. It became a lingua franca for a large swath of CS research. In
education, Haskell helps CS students learn to think better. The quality of ideas represented in
the Haskell ecosystem has attracted both small and large companies. In many ways, the story
of Haskell is one of success. Perhaps it was unavoidable after all.</p><p>As good as the core concepts of Haskell are, users adopting it are often exposed to some very
rough edges. We think it is time for Haskell to have a much smoother on-ramp and more
real-world use cases where it is the clear first choice. There are now countless stories of Haskell
adoption in the industry, but not all are successful. A few companies have even switched away
from Haskell, for reasons that include difficulties with the compiler, tooling and hiring. Once
users can get past these obstacles, they can achieve amazing outcomes, but too often the path
to get there is not clear.</p><p>Haskell is an open-source community. Almost all its tooling and community is created and run
by a strong community of bright volunteers. But these contributors all have other day jobs, so
the Haskell ecosystem still lacks crucial social, technical and organizational “glue”.
We believe that every single obstacle standing in the way of Haskell adoption can be overcome.
All technical issues are tractable and require a modest investment of energy, commitment and
financial resources to fix. Likewise the social/community issues: the Haskell community is
packed with friendly, able and motivated contributors who share common values. We think that
by focusing our attention on the critical story of adoption, Haskell can
encourage yet more
innovation in the future, while bringing the benefits of its core ideas to a much larger user base.
We need to encourage adoption in new ways and renew focus on improving the Haskell
ecosystem.</p><h3>The Haskell Foundation</h3><p>That’s why we are forming a non-profit organization, provisionally called “The Haskell
Foundation” (HF), dedicated to advancing the Haskell programming language, related tools,
education and research.</p><h4>Goals</h4><p>HF has these goals:</p><ul><li>To foster a much broader understanding of the benefits of using Haskell among developers who do not currently use Haskell.</li><li>To increase adoption of Haskell substantially, by erasing barriers that inhibit adoption.</li><li>To identify and fill missing “technical gaps”: the useful stuff that makes for a smooth user experience (pain-free installers, documentation, error messages, and much more).</li><li>To help with “community glue”, by nurturing respectful, inclusive communication across the community.
Together these goals form the mission of HF.</li></ul><h4>Principles and Ethos</h4><p>How ​ we pursue the goals of HF is just as important as ​ what t ​ he goals are. HF’s actions will be guided by these core principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Open source</strong>. Haskell is an open source community and HF will embrace the open-source ethos wholeheartedly. HF may develop, or sponsor the development of tools and infrastructure, but it will all be open source.</li><li><strong>Empowering the community</strong>. A major goal of HF is to augment, celebrate, and coordinate the contributions and leadership of volunteers, not to supplant or replace them.</li><li><strong>Open, friendly, and diverse</strong>. For many of us Haskell is more a way of life than a programming language. All are welcome, all can contribute.</li><li><strong>Transparent</strong>. ​ All communication related to code and decision making will be publicly accessible, to enable asynchronous communication and collaboration. Only certain categories of sensitive information (e.g. financial, and matters concerning particular individuals) will be kept confidential.</li><li><strong>True to Haskell’s principles</strong>.​ Haskell’s design puts principle ahead of expediency, notably by cleaving closely to the principles of purely functional programming. Success, yes, but not at all costs!</li></ul><p>We have learned from other open source communities. The ​Rust community​ has a code of
conduct that has benefited the community. They do a remarkably good job of this, in large part
because the Rust community is actively led and nurtured. ​ The Apache Software Foundation​ has
developed clear standards of transparency and consistent governance across all of its 300+
projects, run by volunteers. As we set up HF we have adopted successful approaches like these
into our operating principles.</p><h4>Organization and Funding</h4><p>The organization will seek funding to ensure the longevity and continuous strengthening of the Haskell ecosystem.</p><h5>Structure</h5><p>The Haskell community comprises an amazing group of technical talent and functions today as
an almost entirely volunteer effort. Our goal is make every member of the Haskell community,
and every HF-affiliated Haskell committee feel more support and more productive. We want to
enlarge and diversify our community.</p><p>We have received and incorporated lots of feedback about the best way to
structure HF.</p><ul><li>HF will have a ​ Governing Board​ (“Board” hereafter) that reflects the Haskell community and its stakeholders, including academics, commercial users, and individuals.</li><li>HF will have a staff. The size of the staff will depend on funding, but we intend to hire an Executive​ Director​ (ED), who can organize Haskell outreach, support its funding activities and oversee the rest of the staff. The staff will mostly focus on funding, marketing, and key infrastructure.</li><li>HF will work with existing and new open source teams to channel energy into various efforts like packaging, tools, libraries, compilers, languages, documentation, user experience, and infrastructure. To reiterate, we expect that most technical contributions will be volunteer, just as it is today, but we want to position HF to fill gaps that can help adoption.</li><li>HF will establish a code of conduct and transparent decision-making that will apply to itself and any associated teams.</li><li>To the extent HF funds and pursues technical goals itself, it will pursue those goals with the same transparency as we expect from any of the teams associated with it. In this way HF will augment the community in a transparent way.</li></ul><p>We think that HF represents one of the final puzzle pieces for Haskell. A new organization will
provide a way to fund and coordinate Haskell development going forward. We hope that all key
committees that currently support Haskell will align HF’s values and mission and we are working
with those committees that wish to voluntarily affiliate with HF. Discussions with those teams are
currently underway. We don’t want to simply add another Haskell committee.</p><h5>Who are the HF organizers?</h5><p>The idea of the Haskell Foundation has been developed by an informal working group including</p><ul><li>Representatives from the haskell.org committee, the Core Library Committee (CLC), the Hackage Trustees and the GHC Devops Committee, and other Haskellers.</li><li>Haskell companies, who are generously providing financial, advisory, and in-kind support.</li><li>Numerous long-standing members of the Haskell community.</li></ul><h5>Funding</h5><p>There have been other initiatives of this kind in the past, but they have proved hard to sustain.
A big part of this has been a simple lack of bandwidth in a highly decentralised community run
entirely by volunteers.
We expect to launch with a small group of founding sponsors. The Board and staff will take over
that function after launch. Our goal is to raise around $1m/year in cash and in-kind
contributions.</p><h3>Improving the Haskell Adoption Story</h3><p>Promoting Haskell adoption has three major components:</p><ul><li>Eliminating unreasonable and perceived barriers to adoption.</li><li>Educating the tech community about the benefits of adoption, including decision makers.</li><li>Enhancing the tooling, so that the risk of adoption is dramatically reduced.</li></ul><h4>Eliminating unreasonable and perceived barriers to adoption</h4><p>We expect that with HF adding a little structure, some things can be improved immediately. For
example, we need an entry point for Haskell that speaks to the needs of a range of users: from
engineers looking for an easy on-ramp with our best advice on how to learn and use Haskell, to
team leaders who want to assess Haskell adoption as a business decision. The Haskell
community today does not cover the full range of content needed to promote adoption. This is
one example where an organization with the right focus and some resources can easily have a
positive impact.</p><h4>Educating the tech community</h4><p>Engineers are typically the ones who drive Haskell adoption. But they often need permission or
sponsorship from managers 1 or 2 levels higher. These decision makers are people who are
more concerned about speed of development, reliability, maintenance, and
people. We need to
explicitly address a broader audience and position Haskell as the best solution to many
problems, while maintaining integrity and avoiding too much “marketing speak".</p><p>Conditions for telling this story are favorable. The days of a senior sysadmin dictating which
version of Java or Python “shall be used” are dying. Containers and cloud technology have
inadvertently conspired to permit engineering teams to make these …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

              The most flexible weightlifting tracker app ever. Build complex routines like
              <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/" target="_blank">Stronglifts 5x5</a>,
              <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/gzclp/" target="_blank">GZCLP</a>,

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This app allows you to get experience similar to e.g.
        <a href="https://stronglifts.com/apps/" target="_blank">Stronglifts 5x5 app</a>, but for any possible
        weightlifting routine ever. <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/gzclp/" target="_blank">GZCLP</a>,
        <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/5-3-1-primer/" target="_blank">5/3/1</a>,
        <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/nsuns-lp/" target="_blank">nSuns LP</a>, or any variation of those
        could be expressed via built-in scripting language <a href="https://www.liftosaur.com/docs/docs.html"><strong>Liftoscript</strong></a>. E.g. Squats progression and deload logic in Stronglifts 5x5 could be expressed in
        <strong>Liftoscript</strong> as:
      </p>

      <pre><code>
if (completedReps &gt;= reps) {
  state.weight = state.weight + 5lb
} else {
  state.failures = state.failures + 1
}
if (state.failures &gt; 2) {
  state.failures = 0
  state.weight = state.weight * 0.9
}
</code>
</pre>
      <p>
        And you can modify it in any way you want. E.g. you may change increments to 2.5lb, change max number of
        failures to 5, you may completely change the logic to anything you want. You have access to completed sets,
        reps, weights, you can create any state variables you want. There's also a bunch of example routines written in
        the same Liftoscript language from
        <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/" target="_blank">thefitness.wiki</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Recently I have joined a Sydney start-up program, <a href="https://www.antler.co/">Antler</a>, and have been hanging out with pretty unique and interesting people. As part of the program, I participated in the CTO forum, where all things tech in start-ups were discussed. One of the topics was about our approaches to testing. In any large gathering of tech-minded people, there is always a non-zero number of people who say, for whatever reason, “I don’t have time for testing…”. It always cracks me up as I find myself wanting to ask, “Have you budgeted the time for fixing issues after release then? How about the time for testing every subsequent new release manually?” I personally don’t ever want to have to come across untested software – whether on my phone, in traffic control systems, or in medical devices. Thus I feel it’s time to talk about what testing means and where it sits in the grand scheme of software engineering.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Testing is a critical part of software engineering and part of a software life-cycle (SDLC). When someone says – “no time for testing during product development” – they better budget time for fixing things in production.</li>
  <li>Testing is even more critical when new developers join your team.</li>
  <li>Testing is <strong>not</strong> about testing the <em>code</em> but making sure the <em>application is working</em> and stays that way.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="feature-driven-development">Feature-driven development.</h2>
<p>Let us consider how a software solution develops from scratch in a start-up. The process typically starts with an idea like “I want my users to be able to do <blah> with the help of my app". In this case, <blah> is a business function we want our app to perform. This function might be a solution to a customer problem or a part of such a solution.</blah></blah></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For example – the ToDo app allows you to create a task and then mark it as done. Some advanced versions might even feature an option to edit task descriptions and even delete them. So that’s a few functions. The functions solve a clear problem – the management of tasks.</p>

  <p>A slightly more advanced design might include scheduling tasks and notifying yourself about deadlines and nudges. This will help solve a somewhat different problem of driving tasks to completion, as opposed to just passively storing lists of things to do.</p>

  <p>Yet another tweak of design might enable you to collaborate with multiple users, assigning tasks to people etc. – all to solve a bigger problem – coordinating people and teams to work together efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Identifying problems customers are experiencing: this is what defines a business. Implementing solutions to these problems: this is the engineering domain. Good engineering practice breaks a solution down into a set of independent components, aka features. This lowers the burden on individual engineers, as they need to keep fewer details in their active memory. A good division of labour also enables multiple people (or teams) to work in parallel, thus delivering the whole solution faster. Furthermore, it allows the solution to be delivered to customers incrementally. In some cases, it’s helpful to validate with business customers the fit and general direction of the development as well as creating an early engagement. So lots of positives! In contrast, waiting for everything to be <em>ready</em> and <em>perfect</em> before releasing the product creates certain challenges.</p>

<p>First of all, how do we know something is ready and perfect? Do you ask your customers, “Is this working for you?” What if you don’t have customers yet? What if your app is non-interactive, such as micro-controller firmware? No one to ask there. Thus we need a way to assess that solution is ready and it stays ‘<em>ready</em>’ as we update it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unit test – a piece of code specifically designed to test another piece of code. The need to create unit tests originated from the constrains of micro-controller development where the effects of bugs are not readily observable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="do-we-have-time-to-test-things">Do we have time to test things?</h2>
<p>In a good project, there is always a backlog of features we need to deliver to make an app great. This creates a dilemma; should we prioritise the development of planned features, or write tests for features already in the works, or even existing ones. In my experience, the most common response to this is – “we need to focus on getting that customer value out and we can fix things later, if ever”. Another answer is, “Or we can just write better code, right? It’s also the most incorrect answer possible.</p>

<p>To understand why this is incorrect, we need to establish the point at which a ‘feature’ is actually complete. For some projects, the answer might be simple: when the code has been written. A slightly more mature approach is to consider a feature done when a user can use it, but if it’s not ready, we don’t want to put it in front of a user. How do you assess that a user can indeed use it? Some test manually – playing the role of a user. That requires some knowledge of users’ business processes to know how they interact with the software. And how do you assess that users can use it on an ongoing basis, even after the next version has been released? Test every release, of course! Every feature in every release! For all time! That’s a lot of testing. Have you budgeted time for that?</p>

<h2 id="composition-of-features--multiplication-of-test-cases">Composition of features – multiplication of test cases.</h2>
<p>What I am talking about here is the fact that all features have a life-cycle. They are conceived, implemented and released into the wild… and occasionally – removed. What that means for the engineering team is that they need to take into account that once a code for a feature has been written, it will go on to live a separate life. It will likely stay alive through the ongoing evolution of a project as other components are added and updated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a personal anecdote: I had joined a team and started working on a new project that had been in production for a while. My task was to add a new feature: “No problem – it seems like an independent and well-defined piece of work”, I thought.</p>

  <p>Once the code was done and passed all the tests it got approved by other engineers. So I merged the branch and promoted my version to a staging environment for internal testing. I’d tested it as well as I could and all seemed to be in order.</p>

  <p>Sometime later an architect came looking for me asking why I had broken screen <blah>. He told me I should revert my changes! I was surprised, as I had checked the version in staging and screen "blagh" seemed in perfect order to me. I asked the architect, "Well surely you have tests for this screen functions, and they would have picked up any issues?" "We don't have 100% test coverage!" was the answer. I looked at my screen, and then at his, and they looked different. After a bit of investigation, we realised that we were using different testing accounts, and the architect's account had special features enabled, which changed the appearance on screen "blagh". These features were only available for a special type of user, and I had no idea they even existed for this app. It turned out that this architect was the only person in Engineering who knew about these features. It made me wonder what other features I didn't know about and had not tested. More importantly – what would have happened if the architect had been on holidays? Customers that actually use those special features would have had a bad day. Not a great prospect.</blah></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As engineers, we can’t reasonably expect <em>everyone</em> to know <em>everything</em>. This is especially true for new engineers joining our teams. They’re not going to know all the features of an existing product, especially if it’s not a consumer product. They can’t test features they don’t know exist. However, that’s in essence what is required of a new engineer delivering a new feature, in the absence of automated tests; they need to make sure all existing features are intact when something has been fixed, or a new feature added.</p>

<p>A natural human reaction (<em>I assume here that most developers are human, but in case our robot overlords find this blog in a distant future – this is true for all beings</em>) when approaching the unknown is to slow down and observe the environment, checking it for dangers. This ancient adaptation works well even in our modern days where our environment is not a forest, but social landscapes, product road-maps (past and present) and existing codebases. Indeed, no one wants fresh devs jumping into a codebase, changing things without considering lurking dangers. These dangers may be in the form of breaking things and processes one might be not aware of. In other words, developers naturally feel afraid to change things because they might break. This fear is paralysing. Yet this is the opposite of what developers are hired for – to make changes and thus advance products.</p>

<p>One proven way to alleviate this fear is to create a safety net of tests. For one – we can reduce the damage of a ‘failure’ by moving it from the production to the development stage. If failure is detected and remedied before it reaches customers, there will be no externally observable impact (other than disappointing your team  that things are not perfect and causing a bit of delay for fixing – which should be budgeted for anyway). With good test coverage, if something important breaks due to developer actions, a developer will see it straight away with a fresh knowledge of changes and is in control to fix it. I am sure a lot of readers would recognise this principle as “refactoring without fear”. Racing car drivers can drive at full speed because they have confidence in the safety of the track. In a similar way, when developers have an adequate support structure we shed our fear and can move fast to make changes.</p>

<h2 id="sdlc-design-and-development-deployment-and-evolution">SDLC: design and development? Deployment and Evolution!</h2>
<p>What does a proper support structure look like? We want to be able to add new features into an existing product (which may be just an app starter example – for a new project), and be sure all the current features remain working.

                <p><b>Now available!</b> <i>Calling Bull: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World</i>, by  Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West.

                <p><b>The world is awash in bull.</b>  Politicians are unconstrained by facts. Science is conducted by press release.  Higher education rewards bull over analytic thought. Startup culture elevates bull to high art. Advertisers wink conspiratorially and invite us to join them in seeing through all the bull — and take advantage of our lowered guard to bombard us with bull of the second order. The majority of administrative activity, whether in private business or the public sphere, seems to be little more than a sophisticated exercise in the combinatorial reassembly of bull. </p>

                <p>We're sick of it. It's time to do something, and as educators, one constructive thing we know how to do is to teach people. So, the aim of this course is to help students navigate the bull-rich modern environment by identifying bull, seeing through it, and combating it with effective analysis and argument.</p>
                                              
                <p>What do we mean, exactly, by <em>bull</em> and <em>calling bull</em>? As a first approximation:</p>
                    
                <p><em>Bull</em> involves language, statistical figures, data graphics, and other forms of presentation intended to persuade by impressing and overwhelming a reader or listener, with a blatant disregard for truth and logical coherence. </p>
                
                <p><em>Calling bull</em> is a performative utterance, a speech act in which one publicly repudiates something objectionable. The scope of targets is broader than bull alone. You can call bull on bull, but you can also call bull on lies, treachery, trickery, or injustice. </p>
                
                <p>In this course we will teach you how to spot the former and effectively perform the latter.</p>
                <p>While bull may reach its apogee in the political domain, this is not a course on political bull. Instead, we will focus on bull that comes clad in the trappings of scholarly discourse. Traditionally, such highbrow nonsense has come couched in big words and fancy rhetoric, but more and more we see it presented instead in the guise of big data and fancy algorithms — and these quantitative, statistical, and computational forms of bull are those that we will be addressing in the present course.</p>
                
                <p> Of course an advertisement is trying to sell you something, but do you know whether the TED talk you watched last night is also bull — and if so, can you explain why? Can you see the problem with the latest <i>New York Times</i> or <i>Washington Post</i> article fawning over some startup's big data analytics? Can you tell when a clinical trial reported in the <i>New England Journal</i> or <i>JAMA</i> is trustworthy, and when it is just a veiled press release for some big pharma company? </p>
                    
                <p><b>Our aim in this course is to teach you how to think critically about the data and models that constitute evidence in the social and natural sciences.</b> </p>

      <h2>Self Referential Formula in Math</h2>
      <p>Keywords: math, quine, self-reference, Tupper</p>
      <p>Published: 23 Jun 2011 - see updates at the bottom</p>
      <h3>Tupper's formula</h3>
      <p>
        <b>See newer self-referential stuff:</b>
        <a href="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference-smooth/index.html">my 2019 self-referential formula uses Bézier curves instead of bitmaps</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have seen <a href="https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/how-does-tuppers-self-referential-formula-work/">
        this blog about Tupper self-referential formula</a> recently.
        This formula is interesting. Its graph contains all possible
        bitmaps that fit in region of 17 * 106 grid. So it is not much
        of wonder that one of those many bitmaps contains meaningful
        representation of the formula itself. Actually, there multiple
        ways to fit the formula in 17*106 grid, so there are multiple
        occurrences of the formula in the graph. But there are also
        all other formulas that fit. It is not truly self-referential
        since number N which you need to find right viewport is not
        included inside (see updates at the bottom, Jeff Tupper has
	produced additional formulas that are truly self-referential,
	but this famous one is not).
	You cannot fit a bitmap represented as number
        in the same bitmap as fonts you would use for base-10 number
        would take at least 4*3 "pixels" per digit while that digit
        carries only log<sub>2</sub>10 bits. Is there a better way
        than that? Some form of compression might work.
      </p>
      <h3>Trávník's formula</h3>
      <p>
        So I though how I would design a formula that would be truly
        self-referential. This design process is more like programming
        for several reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I expected it will take one evening (4hrs), but it took
        three evenings :-)</li>
        <li>I had to debug the formula and refine it until it started to work.</li>
        <li>Formula had to be designed incrementally, in small pieces.</li>
        <li>Getting the picture takes a lot of computational time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here is the formula in final form (I will probably describe
        steps how I arrived to this form in some follow up article if
        there is enough interest). Originally I have used Haskell in
        design process. To verify final form, I had to create
        C program (uses GMP big number library) since Haskell was too
        slow. This allowed me to verify it again that the formula is
        matching the program. This is the formula as formated with
        LyX:
      </p>
      
      <p><img src="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference/travnik-self-referential-formula-lyx.png" alt="Travnik's self referential formula (LyX)"></p><p>
        Now this one omitted the value of N. The N is very big number,
        it contains 12876 digits. You can see the N in the graph of
        the function below. Also, you can copy and paste the N from
        C source program below. Here is the function as it graphs
        itself (inside yellow border):
      </p>
      
      <p><img src="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference/travnik-self-referential-formula-graph.png" alt="Travnik's self referential formula (graph)"></p><p>
        You can find source of the program I used to plot it <a href="https://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference/selfref-demo.c">here</a> (it requires <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP big number library</a> to
        compile and run). At the top of the program there are
        constants which allow to define viewport you want. It is set
        to some interesting region that includes part of N. But you
        can set it to whole region if you have patience. Output graph
        is printed on terminal, '#' denotes true value, ' ' denotes
        false values. If you set wider X axis than fits the terminal,
        you can redirect to file and open in non-word wrapping editor
        with monospaced font. I have transformed such file to PBM
        ASCII format and used GIMP to get the image above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beware that the C program is very slow. On my computer it ran
        for about 30 hours. I could optimize it, but I wanted the
        functions in C to correspond closely to the functions in the
        formula. While the program uses integer values for x and
        y computation, you can graph it with real valued x and y too.
        You can make it significantly faster if you don't want
        to see all digits of the N in this way. Replace:
      </p>
      <pre>        nnnBase10Len=strlen(strnnn)-1;
      </pre>
      <p>with</p>
      <pre>        nnnBase10Len=60;
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this case, you will see only last 60 digits of the N (and
        they will be shifted to different locations).
      </p>

<h2>00:00:00 Intro</h2>
<ul>

<li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/tlbhit">@tlbhit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mov-fp-sp/id1538369465?i=1000496866078">This episode on Apple podcast</a></li>
<li>The stack pretty much always TLB hits!</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:00:59 Disclaimer</h2>
<ul>
<li>We're lifelong learners, only know so much!</li>
<li>Will put errata up on <a href="https://tlbh.it/">the TLB Hit website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_channel">"Sidechannels"</a> via Twitter</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:01:42 What's the stack?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Episode is named <code>mov fp sp</code></li>
<li><code>mov fp sp</code> in the prologue of functions</li>
<li>Epilogue has "reverse" <code>mov sp fp</code></li>
<li>Instructions that manipulate <em>the stack</em>!</li>
<li>Compiler spills values that registers can't hold onto the stack</li>
<li>Functions do it a lot -- have their own [local] state, call functions that
have their own state</li>
<li>Because subroutines can recurse without bounds would need unbounded number of
registers</li>
<li>Often different kinds of registers: arithmetic value registers, floating
point registers</li>
<li>Registers contain fairly arbitrary "stuff": pointers to data, pointers to
code, return addresses, etc.</li>
<li>Stack is <em>usually</em> contiguous and allocated on a per-thread basis</li>
<li>Idea of "GPRs": general purpose registers, though some machines have
dedicated registers for floating point values as well, or SIMD for really
wide</li>
<li>Prologue moves stack pointer to base pointer, epilogue moves base pointer
back to stack pointer, "undoing", locally manipulating the stack pointer then
rolling things back to where they previously were</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:03:50 Mechanisms in the processor</h2>
<ul>
<li>Frame pointer/base pointer (bp/fp), stack pointer (sp)</li>
<li>Usual convention is that the frame pointer doesn't change during the course
of the function's execution</li>
<li>Generated code addresses "slots" relative (at offsets from) the frame
pointer; e.g. <code>+4</code>, <code>+8</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Stack is kind of like a linked list! Pointer of the stack that says "this is
where the frame pointer <em>used to be</em> before we came into this routine".</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:05:10 Comparison to an abstract stack machine</h2>
<ul>
<li>In CS class you may learn about machines where you push two operands onto a
stack then do an add operation that consumes the top two things on the stack</li>
<li>Compare to traditional processor we use today: expanding the stack as a
single operation that makes a bunch of slots at once</li>
<li>The slots don't need to be consumed in a strictly stack-order fashion</li>
<li>Distinction of "stack machine" vs scratchpad-area style frame areas
that happen in stack-like fashion for subroutine calls</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:06:05 Some instruction set considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Considerations on modern machines for frequency of these operations and how
they fit in our instruction cache; e.g. on x86 <code>push</code>/<code>pop</code> are single byte
opcodes</li>
<li>On ARM we may have a "push multiple values" instruction; little CISC-y but you
do so commonly it may make some sense</li>
<li>ARMv7 had instruction allowed to push 16 registers (all GPRs) and increment
stack pointer. Yay RISC!</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:07:09 Compiler optimizations and stackiness</h2>
<ul>
<li>By moving things onto the stack -- code is constantly working with the things
in its stack frame</li>
<li>Locality, but also avoiding memory allocation subroutines (100s or 1000s of
cycle depending)</li>
<li>In scratchpad area values are tracked precisely in dataflow sort of style</li>
<li>Bring them "in" to the compiler, values becomes more trackable</li>
<li>SSA values vs arbitrary memory references</li>
<li>When structs are brought onto the stack the individual fields inside can be
broken apart and the component fields can be tracked as individual values</li>
<li>Often called "scalar replacement of aggregates" (e.g. in LLVM)</li>
<li>When we home them on the stack we can do our common optimizations, CSE, DCE;
if on the heap, may be a lot harder to to do</li>
<li>In managed languages (e.g. JavaScript, Java) would do escape analysis to show
it doesn't escape via heap to an unknown subroutine -- once placed on the
stack you can eliminate whole objects and just track sub-fields inside of it</li>
<li>Allows you to just "explode" the object itself and think about its component
fields individually and get rid of whatever doesn't matter in there</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:09:17 Eliding heap allocations in C++</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some compilers can also sometimes optimize local heap allocations, turn them
into stacky allocation</li>
<li>C++ explicitly allows you to do that as of a few years ago, Clang does that</li>
<li>If you new an object no guarantee that you're actually going to put it on the
heap / call the underlying allocator</li>
<li>Can be surprising to people -- can do SRoA, other stuff, might get rid of the
entire computation</li>
<li>Neat, unless it's not what you're trying to do</li>
<li>But seems like a key optimization to do</li>
<li>If you're thinking about things as objects instead of raw bytes having higher
level understanding you can optimize based off of is pretty key it seems?</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:10:18 Frame pointer omission</h2>
<ul>
<li>When JF started programming there was "frame pointer omission" (FPO) which
was cool because optmizers weren't as good as they are now</li>
<li>Back when you only had 8 registers for x86 the extra register could go a long
way potentially -- stack is hot in cache but doing stores and loads to memory
locations</li>
<li>Was known to some as "that flag that makes the debugger way worse" -- debug
information has to be a lot more prescriptive when you can't simply describe
where things are as an offset from a canonical (assumed unchanging) register</li>
<li>Modern CPUs doing register renaming under the hood against a much bigger
micro-architectural register set -- not as worried about saving that one
register as much of the time -- although in hot code you still might</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:11:49 "Leaf" functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you inline things you make bigger regions for analysis, ideally make big
fat leaf functions</li>
<li>How much of program time is generally spent in leaf functions over some set
of applications?</li>
<li>Function at the end of the call tree</li>
<li>If your subroutine doesn't call any other subroutines that's a nice property,
because now you know that everything at the end of the stack belongs to you,
you're just doing your work and popping back up to whoever called you</li>
<li>Inlining really unlocks power of leaf -- inlining into non-leaf-functions can
<em>make</em> them become the leaf</li>
<li>So long as you don't over-inline and the working set doesn't become too big
-- the compiler can know everything it does and have a good amount of work to
do</li>
<li>Small region in which you can analyze <em>everything</em>, like tiny little whole
program analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:13:10 Why do we have a stack again?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why can't we inline everything?</li>
<li>Two main issues: 1) don't necessarily know call graph for the whole program
2) recursion</li>
<li>If you knew where all the calls went (virtual/indirect/etc in your
translation unit and other ones in your program), and without recursion, you
wouldn't need a stack, you know a perfect call graph</li>
<li>For some of these you could avoid having a stack -- virtual functions but
only a few actually implementations of it, could change to test-and-branch</li>
<li>If you have a fully analyzable virtual dispatch it effectively just becomes a
switch, can potentially inline what the targets are</li>
<li>Control flow analysis takes indirect branch that can go anywhere and
enumerate the real set of possibilities (devirtualization within a
translation unit)</li>
<li>Fully analyzeable call graph is an interesting computer history topic:
FORTRAN77 classically able to do this (programs were restricted enough you
could analyze it)</li>
<li>XLA ML/array programming machine learning compiler has the same property
where the whole call graph is analyzeable so you can create a slab that's the
giant frame for the whole program you're optimizing and all allocations are
known-fixed size</li>
<li>Whole program call graph analyzeability lives on in these niche use cases!</li>
<li>In stark contrast, sometimes we need multiple different kinds of stacks at
the same time!</li>
<li>The JS engine would sometimes recur from JS calls through the VM runtime to
other JS code, and that would need to potentially create a sub-stack (!) --
multi stack problems exist beyond even just needing to analyze/manage a
single stack</li>
<li>Programming in FORTRAN is cool, for scientific code often trying to
solve a specific physics problem don't <em>usually</em> need those tools like
recursion or virtual functions</li>
<li>When everything is "monomorphized" -- you have big arrays of
fixed-value-types you can know everything about the world and really optimize
everything based off of it -- fun mode to be in for scientific computing code</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:16:34 Considerations beyond recursion and indirect calls?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some languages use the stack for fast thread switching? Things like full
stackful coroutines?</li>
<li>Stacks in Go for example are not contiguous: more like C++ deque: linked list
of lists instead of one contiguous stack -- clever x86 code sequence that
makes it fast to find previous and next frame</li>
<li>Allows Go stacks to be distinct allocations -- each page-wise is one frame
and the next function has another frame -- can put multiple functions in one
allocation</li>
<li>Used to have really bad perf if you were in a hot loop and happened to
straddle that boundary</li>
<li>Coroutines in some languages ended up having some "stackless" stuff like
this, where the closure is heap allocated instead</li>
<li>C++ coroutines try to do away with all the heap allocations, but depends on
optimization level whether it can do that or not</li>
<li>Kind of similar for Objective-C blocks -- until recently always heap
allocated, started being stack allocated in last few years where they could</li>
<li>Language doesn't say whether stuff lives on the heap or not</li>
<li>Because stack is less constrained can live in different places, e.g. in Go</li>
<li>In some cases you remove the allocation entirely</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:18:25 Scaling to millions of threads?</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you want to be able to scale your concurrency assumptions to millions of
threads, you don't want to have huge stacks</li>
<li>Each thread has a stack, and if you have millions of threads you don't want
to be allocating too much</li>
<li>And need to be able to switch between those threads quickly</li>
<li>So raises the question: how do you usually size those stacks in the
per-thread context you have?</li>
<li>If you're doing tiny little operations; e.g. if every operation in your
program was conceptually a thread, you wouldn't want to allocate 512KiB every
time you did a tiny atomic operation</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:19:10 Managed languages putting frames on the heap</h2>

<p>Avoiding stupidity is a powerful way to reach your success goals. You don’t always need to do great things. You can go a long way if you avoid stupid mistakes.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am talking about the stupid things I have done while building my first startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I joined&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-w17-launch-lively-scaphold-marketfox-floyd-servx-fibo-and-wifi-dabba/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketfox</a>&nbsp;with the dream of building the next big thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We had the opportunity to move to the much-coveted Silicon Valley, after being funded by Ycombinator – one of the best startup accelerators in the world. It was a dream come true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward two years, we had to shut down the company due to several reasons – one of them being the lack of revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few stupid things I have done while building that startup.</p>



<h2><strong>Not taking care of ourselves</strong></h2>



<p>Rents in the Bay Area are super high.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We didn’t have a fortune back then. We were on a budget – but I think we could have used what we had to do certain things better.</p>



<p>We slept on the carpeted floor. All we had was one table and a few chairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We worked mostly sitting on the floor, combating the cold mornings. It also took a toll on our productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My cofounder took the picture below – I had fallen asleep writing code.</p>

<h2><strong>Working 15-16 hours a day</strong></h2>



<p>Hard work is romanticized by the startup world. I used to brag how many hours I worked a day as if it is an achievement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do not get me wrong – consistent work matters a lot if you want to be successful.</p>



<p>But the number of hours is not directly proportional to the output and is far from the outcome. Your body needs rest and good food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After some point, we lost the notion of day and night. We slept at random times, woke up at random times, and continued working.</p>



<h2><strong>Imbalance in decision making</strong></h2>



<p>Most of the decisions were often made by a single person, without enough brainstorming. It is not the ideal way of working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast decision making is crucial in a startup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is also important to include the key people and letting them have their say in making that decision.</p>



<p>Talk about things you feel are wrong. If you do not value your opinions, do not expect someone else to do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Never let someone else control you. Never let someone else make a decision that is yours.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Not moving enough</strong></h2>



<p>It took me a while to understand the importance of a healthy lifestyle. The effects of physical exercise on mental health are still very underrated.</p>



<p>In the beginning, we worked and we slept. That was it. Over time we started going for occasional walks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We always resort to eating junk food(which I don’t regret much, because most of them were delicious) and not exercising enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far it was about personal mistakes, but we also made plenty of classic startup mistakes along the way. </p>



<h2><strong>Not talking to our customers</strong></h2>



<p>We shipped features at a tremendous pace. But we never talked to enough users to identify if it was something necessary. We assumed things and kept building – in a few months, we had a product which was an engineering marvel – but nobody cared to use.</p>



<h4><strong>Too much building and not enough selling</strong></h4>



<p>I still look back with awe at the speed with which we shipped. But it does not matter if you cannot sell the product.</p>



<p>We focused less on selling and this was a big mistake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were very naive to think that building software is the hardest part of building a startup.</p>



<h2><strong>Copying from competitors&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>All the companies do this. Look at what stories from Snapchat have done to the social apps.</p>



<p>But even when you copy features, you have to make sure your users want it. Instagram copied the stories successfully, but when Medium tried the same, it was not very successful.</p>



<p>Copying from the competition will only get you as far as them. Your goal should be to build things that are much better than them if you want to make people switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless the new product is excellent, it won’t overcome the pain of making the switch.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Lack of vision</strong></h4>



<p>It is always a good idea to have a grand vision for the company if you are raising venture capital.</p>



<p>We blindly kept building features without any vision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A simple question we should ask ourselves is – Who is your ideal user? What do they want to achieve with your product?</p>



<p>We had a bunch of features, probably what five different products would have done. But no single user wanted.</p>



<h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. It was an experience that changed my life for the good. I’m happy that I did it – I am happy that I tried and failed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I learned a lot. About people, trust, and startups.&nbsp;</p>

appals you. I've been using computers since 1988 and the net since 1995
and over time, something's happened. During the last decade or so, my 
mind has increasingly been preoccupied with the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm no longer in control of my computer and my OS.</li>
<li>The modern web is a cesspool of tracking scripts, ads, 
malware and clickbait designed to suck you in and make you stupid.</li>
<li>Even the most premium commercial software and hardware more often
than not comes with contraptions to spy on you.</li>
<li>"Cloud apps" are replacing programs I'd much rather run natively.</li>
<li>Thus, we sacrifice our privacy and intellects for faux conveniences.</li>
<li>The Idealist Net we fondly remember is long dead and unlikely to come
back.</li>
<li>...but there are still pockets of sanity left.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a child of the home computer boom, I'm used to general purpose 
machines that do my bidding without interference from neither the 
manufacturer nor some unknown other wanting to sell me Depends and 
Bitcoins. That's what I want my computing to <i>still</i> be like.
</p>

<p>
The Man wants something different, though. The Man wants you to log in, 
click accept, sell your soul and Buy More Stuff. Hence, working to avoid 
that must be some level of subversive computing: Sticking it to The Man, 
one bit at a time.
</p>

<p>
In this text, I'll try to outline how I do my best to achieve that. Fair 
warning: it doesn't come without what some would call sacrifice, because 
you can't have the cake and eat it. This "sacrifice", however, might 
ultimately turn out to be beneficial.
</p>

<h2>What I absolutely do not use</h2>

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<p>
This is a dead giveaway, of course. No facebook and no facebook services 
(E.G. instagram, whatsapp, messenger, etc).
</p>

<p>
Quitting was, considering the circumstances, very easy. I'd had a 
facebook account since 2007 and I used to live there, sometimes posting 
several times a day and checking in much more often. In the summer of 
2019, I wrote a goodbye post and the day after, I closed my account. 
This is more than a year ago now and I don't miss it.
</p>

<p>
I had an Instagram account for a while, but only used it for maybe a 
month or two. It's the second stupidest "service" available on the net 
right now, and that's saying a lot: It is, quite literally, a site 
where millions of people post daily photos of their dinners. To put it 
as nicely as I can: Instagram has absolutely zero content of any kind of 
real importance to anyone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None, really. It turns out that people who are 
interested in meeting with or talking to you will send an email or text 
or perhaps even call you. I'm also particularly thankful I didn't have to
witness the COVID-19 debacle unfold on social media.
</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>
Beating Instagram, Twitter is currently the stupidest site on the net. 
Best described as a slowly decomposing swamp of infighting and political 
bickering, it's full of people who will not yield a millimeter in any 
direction and will never, ever change their opinions about anything.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None. Ditching twitter is something I advice 
everyone to do, even those who will gladly sell their DNA for a bit of 
"free" online convenience. You'll feel much more at peace with the world 
without it.
</p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>
If facebook is a dead giveaway, this is the truly crucial part of the 
concept. Facebook deals with distractions - Google deals with 
infrastructure. No longer one of many actors on the net, their monopoly 
quite simply dictates what goes and what doesn't. A recent reminder was 
when their domain blacklisting suddenly identified 
pouet.net, an innocent site for discussing the demo scene, as a spreader 
of malware. Things were, as usual, only resolved because someone knew 
someone who worked at Google. To discourage their thuggish, predatory 
behavior, we should avoid them in any way possible.
</p>

<p>
I closed down my Google account together with my Facebook account. I 
haven't missed that one, either. I also switched to searching with 
DuckDuckGo. The major point here is to <i>not</i> find a "replacement 
Google", such as Office 365 and Onedrive. That's not taking back control 
over your data, that's just handing it to the next buffoon for continued 
mining.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I now pay for my email. A mom-and-pop hosts it 
all for a very reasonable yearly fee and they throw in some pretty 
decent web hosting, too. Complete self-hosting would of course be ideal 
from a privacy standpoint, but I'm happy with this solution. I can also 
mount the home directory through sshfs, which makes it an excellent 
"cloud drive". When I've been in contact with their customer support,
they've been timely, friendly, efficient and professional.
</p>

<p>
All things considered, it's probably nowhere near as safe 
from third-party intrusion and reliable against service outage as 
the Google equivalent, but then again I didn't use Google Drive for
anything important, either. That's what my hard drives and USB sticks are for. 
Don't hand over the stuff that matters to third parties if you can avoid 
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat:</b> Some people might actually need Google Docs for work, because 
employers like to force their employees into certain ecosystems. I'm 
forced into other ecosystems by mine, see
<a href="#tacs">Tradeoffs and Concessions</a>
below. The best option in these cases is of course to use it exclusively for 
work, exclusively on your work computer and in a separate web browser if
possible.
</p>

<h3>Many more sites</h3>

<p>
There are tons of sites, services and apps I don't use, for example 
Paypal and Dropbox. In fact, I avoid most sites where I have to register 
an account.
</p>

<h3>Phone Apps</h3>

<p>
My employer supplies me with a smartphone. On it I keep only the apps I 
need for work and banking. When commuting was still a thing, I also 
listened to Spotify. Other than that, I try to use it as little as 
possible these days. I do carry it with me, though: it mostly works fine 
as a phone and mobile phones are pretty damn convenient.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I've never been fond of having a lot of apps.
Most of them are pointless and solve completely invented problems.
</p>

<h3>My local newspaper</h3>

<p>
I used to pay for an online subscription, until I just decided to stop 
one day. Apart from the poor quality of journalism, the biased reporting and 
the insipid editorial texts, I was basically paying money to keep feeding 
the online ad machine. That's a no-go.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> It's probably a reasonable idea to keep somewhat 
informed about current events. <a href="#news">See "News" below.</a>
</p>

<h2>Things I do use</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
In terms of user empowerment, even Canonical's Ubuntu with its telemetry 
and mysterious snap packages is so far a much better choice than any 
proprietary home computer OS on the market. From a privacy standpoint, 
other distributions, such as Debian and Slackware, are of course even 
better.
</p>

<h3>Native software</h3>

<p>
Turns out there are plenty of good programs that can be used completely 
offline and will let you store your files locally. They're not even hard 
to find. A few tips: Abiword, GNumeric, The Gimp, WordGrinder, 
Audacious.
</p>


<h3>The Web</h3>

<h4>The web, method one: Links2</h4>

<p>
The web still has good parts and I want to get at those good parts. 
Turns out the really good parts are usually remnants of The Old Web, 
consisting of HTML and great content.
</p>

<p>
I try to do as much web browsing as possible in Links2. It's a fast, 
lean browser with zero support for JavaScript and CSS. The latter means 
some sites look a bit funky. The former means some sites won't work at 
all. My usual strategy for sites that won't render without JavaScript is 
to simply ignore them. If they can't produce something worthwhile 
without scripting, it's probably not worthwhile at all.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, no JavaScript means that most trackers and other spy- 
and malware just won't run at all. Since Links doesn't save <i>any</i> 
cookies between sessions, other means of tracking will at least be kept 
somewhat confused. The flip side is that it's probably an extremely 
unique browser fingerprint.
</p>

<h4>The web, method two: RSS and native applications</h4>

<p>
You can subscribe to Youtube channels, subreddits and pretty much every 
blog out there using RSS. There are also plenty of specialized TUI:s and 
CLI:s for interfacing with various popular websites such as Youtube and 
Reddit.
</p>

<h4>The web, method three: Firefox with UBlock Origin</h4>

<p>
For some things, like banking and filing taxes, the Internet really has 
made things so much more convenient I don't want to live without them. 
Although my bank could easily provide the services I use completely 
without a single line of JavaScript, they have decided not to. This also 
goes for most online shopping. For these types of sites, I use Firefox.
</p>

<h3>Youtube</h3>

<p>
There's still plenty of worthwhile content published on Youtube, not 
least recordings of demo scene productions for obscure hardware.
</p>

<p>
I watch Youtube using my own <a href="https://datagubbe.se/yt">tube script</a> in 
combination with a media player. It's not ideal, since Google will be 
able to infer a bit about my habits through my IP (although that could 
of course be mitigated using a VPN) and some videos don't work due to 
various restrictions imposed by their creators (or copyright laws). 
Somewhere around 90% of them do though, especially the interesting 
ones such as Computerphile and Numberphile). The upside is freedom from 
ads and algorithmic "recommendations": I watch only the videos I really 
want to watch.
</p>

<h3>Wikipedia</h3>

<p>
Still a useful and usable site.
</p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<p>
Most of the content produced by news media is either clickbait or some 
kind of "commentary" by "experts" on actual headline news, which can 
then be milked for another couple of days. More often than not, the 
reporting is either misinformed, or biased, or both. Still, keeping 
somewhat updated can be beneficial for private decision making and 
overall …</p></div></div>

<p>Infection Monkey powered by Guardicore is a popular Open Source project and essentially a Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tool that analyzes and breaks down the robustness of cloud-based development environments, regardless of if they are of the private or public type.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ShayNehmad">Shay Nehmad</a>, a seasoned Open Source developer, and Shreya Malviya, a contributor to Infection Monkey, spoke to the participants about how Swimm is making it easier to contribute to the project and make a difference.</p>
<p>The resiliency to post-breach attacks and lateral movement is done with the help of automatic attack simulations that inject a random machine with a proprietary Infection Monkey code, which helps gauge and discover security loopholes and vulnerabilities. Think of it as an automated Pen Testing tool.</p>
<p>The 48 hour online event devoted to encouraging contributions to open source projects hosted by Brian Douglas of Github,&nbsp; the Open Sauced community and backed by Swimm.</p>
<p>Check out the event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHyZ0Wz_A44Ul9-YwiT-zt-JgEy3lRGns">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with Infection Monkey using Swimm</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/guardicore/monkey#:~:text=The%20Infection%20Monkey%20is%20an,a%20centralized%20Monkey%20Island%20server.">Infection Monkey</a> is very straightforward and user-friendly. The Monkey, is a proprietary tool that infects random machines in the target environment and propagates to them. And there is Monkey Island, a dedicated centralized dashboard to monitor the results and findings. More about the Infection Monkey installation process <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/infectionmonkey/wt/">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://swimm.io/media/screen-shot-2020-11-04-at-11.02.48.png" alt="The Map" title="github.com/guardicore/monkey"></p>
<p>Besides being a non-intrusive and plug-and-play tool, Infection Monkey requires zero maintenance and runs around the clock for comprehensive security analysis. Furthermore, users can also get actionable insights and recommendations with the ability to define alerts as per their requirements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Swimm makes the onboarding of contributors to open source projects easier. Since everything related to Swimm is within the Infection Monkey (henceforth: IM) repository, all that you have to do is to clone that repo, start the terminal, and run the command “swimm start” on your terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the server starts, it automatically opens the Swimm homepage, which already has playlists for IM. Currently, the repository includes three playlists (Post-breach action, Configuration, and System Info Collection). For this tutorial, we will use an extra-verbose playlist called “Adding a PBA in 5 Simple Steps”.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wbkmZQhpI08v8F6ivT_mEp0Dsa7mAQ-g9xS4VGAs5-GZniEwnEl_BHm4ui5BqxZRB613RULmPIk1uXOmsVQOVCR5xFmHjUevYXWcrkOk7Rs6BdYT-qQe9bZGhZL-aC1neoYxnROu" alt=""></p>
<p>In a nutshell, Infection Monkey is a penetration testing tool and it simulates a person breaking into your system. Once the person is inside your system, they can perform additional actions after conducting the breach. In IM terminology, these are referred to as the “post-breach actions” or PBAs.</p>
<h4>Define What Your New PBA Does</h4>
<p>This is the actual coding step. As the name suggests, it basically defines what your new PBA does. So, briefly, you have to define what this step will do in IM (as stated in the description). This step also gives you instructions to run the manual test after you are done. But first, let’s do the main coding part.</p>
<p>All you have to do is copy the command from the Swimm interface and run it on your terminal. This will give you some information about this particular unit.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/n--uGoeV2gCm-JCZzKWr3nchhCZsHE8AkrldGNKm-L6uzNRQ4LDeB1zjwooiiENFs5_AAvdu3nSLMKeW0EUTfcewurPHMBbs_3a5RA0F_Nva7nfwAURu_3FGKjhO9QVSejoWHFL6" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the “Definition of done” says that you need a new constant defining what the PBA does. Now, you can ask Swimm to tell you which particular files are relevant to this specific Unit by running the command “Swimm Files”. It shows you the name of one file which is relevant to this Unit.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vtfc9Vr61m_8KQr9uOBS6eK2qMRVgoeCPZRuatXYzAVR40xiq41d3jKJKNql6FRg5GIDNwo26-2X2PPhMAsXNlboVXxKwwcOXdHMrf0bun0_ZYCQtUGOGQxvxRfUSmHS-GEgg4i_" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is pretty cool if you think about how you would do personal onboarding with someone. You would guide them toward the files relevant to what you are teaching.” - Shay Nehmad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we have to see how to define the name of the PBA which is to be done in this file. This really shows how building the Unit correctly can “emulate” or replace the personal onboarding process. Also, another thing we should notice here is that this particular file is in the module called “common”.</p>
<p>This suggests that everything we will do here is going to affect both the Monkey and the Swimm server. Open this file.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lnAb1DR5i9wnsoAZJNe76VeHqwv0wW4xyI9drUrGrH8MgXU6GK_-DRCbL8OGFHCfumQfR0KlvKALtpT-KMfox3wTMdbt0RDAyi89AZZ7CJx9ojaycexEHjTJshfvqdAXyoDGfMxd" alt=""></p>
<p>The comments generated by Swimm show you where you need to add your code. But if you are not sure about what to do next, Swimm provides hints via the command `swimm hint`.</p>
<p>If you go back to the file and look at that PBA, it basically tells you what the PBA with the name “Timestomping” does. That’s how you will also define the name of your new PBA. Add your new PBA “POST_BREACH_SCHEDULE_JOBS” and save the file. You have refined your new PBA, but how do we know this works?</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZMTPTwtUn17Qz2ABXXby8GipDAQSj9vwCgdlWgzYq85FoEBCOHHfkdijUQ5pBFPM-zXneonQNd1fuD0BFgWKtcc3tCE2CxvwD7dOelMiHXvAh9ahDusmIWZWCaEKe84Jghxvreom" alt=""></p>
<p>It's pretty easy when you are using Swimm. Let’s go back to the Swimm interface and learn about some easy and straightforward instructions to run the test.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oj-L3LjKzRhVqKbmPagGdHtkj-AoNYzEgKJ0P8tcg4es6sf1s-TnbG-Ig3BR0t4quDKl6UummO4FJXc-ifobCpWy79QOY-OfQYFexiqYVB3QnrFMxxnZ1dnFvuTuBapRClBTVMyN" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s study the result of this test from its image.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bVQos7iG-I40XJfiDKJ7DH-SnUCed0Xtp5csLgqyLAmDTlUWkqzSRuG6H5DZB6xaLgav7qzcnEhIZrZRW1PZMemZyWYlVLp2YNNWH6Sjdfpz9jAcS4mCxMBKv_SAPd4W91wsmu7o" alt=""></p>
<p>Whatever you added to the PBA definitions file, you should be able to see in the test report. Once you are done studying it, you can mark it as done with the command `swimm done`. This will take you to a Swimm status page (see below) that also allows you to compare your solution to the original codebase.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nU2b4mGCv-mhVLPL8PotXYIeFC70Sid_prw7-oBbknXgnHJxIDSNG8DcwMZ6-19m90mJW4MPX6tEcHPLr3D6YkoO8A90Lya1T0iA9U8My7Eb3BTZntGwb20p6Tf256apGCynI5il" alt=""></p>
<h2>Implement a New PBA</h2>
<p>Now, we know that the schedule jobs PBA is pretty dangerous because if someone is able to schedule jobs on your system, they can leave open a backdoor or ensure a virus downloads itself in case it gets deleted.</p>
<p>So do you now have to schedule jobs in your operating systems? Luckily, Infection Monkey already has these commands in the codebase.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Wc1t9yejLqPPj7VTsIiOB-yIh9N-EVy27EiH9conClOaIA1HAtSpgXlqXrRK0zTqSxK2v1I7Wzw0z94HlAZy8mzfOV0D9sZ-tu5vU1MpfTJi_szhgNGrBjU2v-VRRVfiH0_tsUpI" alt=""></p>
<p>So, all you need to do is fetch commands from a function called `get_commands_to_schedule_jobs`.</p>
<p>Once again, the description of this Unit also shows a manual test to run after writing the code. Just like in the previous Unit, we can play the Unit by copying the command from the Swimm interface and running it on your terminal. You can also request Swimm to tell you the relevant files with the same command.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bMfq0Tlu_TT2BXFJ6z7Bb9SCrN158jAPBO-UKGbhAj2XLqISnxL3c6T_cKXpSGXV-FPlYcgVyQ2R7ejaeFsYM71saNVBIbiIFJ8T3irHqE75aE1TtBp7UORLrR1uAljI3NmkEBZJ" alt=""></p>
<p>This time it tells you that the relevant file is in a module called “infection_monkey” which suggests that whatever we will be doing is going to affect the Monkey (i.e. the virtual intruder simulated by Infection Monkey) itself. This makes sense because you will basically be adding new functionality.</p>
<p>So, once you open the file, you will see a comment that tells you where you need to add your new code. This is something that leaves no place for error.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wD6oSMRb2YH2qY-ZJALKj3FEs10TJO7GaZuU2CFJW2ysPjvYvyPVolFmakq549bFyec4P_hsDNr1iPqpijLwDE6uWEizlQdn9YeJMCMeiQ3BCrd5-8v-ulefx5vfCSaoyouk5EVT" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s ask Swimm for more hints about how to proceed with coding in this Unit.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ffI32iZ3jXpwLuGRb-EGO9tQyZLRIQASQa5AUFY2tImzdEo8ZVMqoNkg0T0h6iniEx-IfowbVRxNpnUELuWi3eGjBidBtl9dP8BINBHzP5AVCkZ__u0hrW6n1EYw4t8JqaMtHTNX" alt=""></p>
<p>Swimm provides you with two hints. Let’s go ahead with the first one which suggests you check the “Time Stomping” PBA to get an idea about the implementation.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RtASkWQPjlZjjUAdFvzPXiV0Zttvuj7VxpbODATTF1aALEv4B9kKhas61sDZO7ikmID77Bs7jX2EF7n1Du-RD8djCShbTW2EpXZZy3dCyG9svG8OoXaoC_z7lgP49NHSxxgY35Vz" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see here that we are basically fetching Linux and Windows commands from a function called `get_timestomping_commands`. Then you will call the constructor for the parent class with the name of the PBA, the Linux commands, and the Windows commands as arguments.</p>
<p>So, you will do something similar to “schedule jobs” PBA.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HhKuTh0wzVAHddeJHHGY7PYUKSweb0TdHtM3hgd3WPgYVIfNL1bKzRuUsvwbH0RC1ml4wsNeivKW9AxrjUd9CvBF6wNQO0txtFfJJPFcljUrS50Gd5P3jSS8fVBygPubLS3ZMGdk" alt=""></p>
<p>Here, you can see the code fetches the commands from the function given in the description and it calls the constructor of the parent class.</p>
<p>Swimm has given you a second hint that notifies you to remove your PBA by removing the schedule jobs.</p>
<p>For that purpose, you can see a call to the function called `remove_scheduled_jobs`.</p>
<p>You can really walk through each line of the solution and see how building the Unit correctly nudged whoever’s solving it to write each line. So, from lines 13 to 18, that was the first hint telling you the general structure of how to implement post-breach actions in IM that are based on shell commands.</p>
<p>Following the hint shows you an example of how to write that code. Another cool thing pops up when we look at line 16. We can see the code is pulling the name of the PBA from the variable we defined in the previous Unit. The last line is from the second hint.</p>
<p>You may decide to not look at the hints and go blind trying to solve it. In this case, when you mark your unit done in Swimm and then compare it to the actual solution, you’ll find that discrepancy. If you forgot to remove the scheduled jobs, you will find it in the diff. It’s up to you as the Swimmer to choose if you’d rather see hints or not.</p>
<p>Now that you have added the code, let’s run the manual test by following the instructions in the Unit’s description.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/h2EUcy5vZxKp9DkINaiSFjQ-5Yv7f_MtnaL5q27cucqc61GrB7xU1OlTH1w5W_1PCKJJE4Pkk1nRdAVlcsDg1EZshdSJvzHqkJS8SlV1_A5icgii59WgGcXCVtVGUX2JJPpR2gZp" alt=""></p>
<p>You can see in the attack report that it successfully scheduled a job using `crontab`. Let’s mark the Unit as done in Swimm with the command `swimm done`. Just like the last step, you will be taken to a page that gives you more information about what changes you’ve just made.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gintBnsEcmxzAzpSPUnZfi8t1657nzb4b0votoNDt9C3sVe6MkR28hl_taR46cOsVwidaJ3imRdeV439FMYmQq6VLxTEe1k6AWR7Ct7bdLSC7SKEj7YdLxL1gjyozdSNewzooDeX" alt=""></p>
<p>This summary guides the person solving the Unit to read other parts of the code. Now that you have made some contributions, you are already more familiar with the lexicon, and manually tested your changes, you now have the context to figure out the code much quicker and improve your productivity when contributing to Infection Monkey!</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ue285WOS8WBBNqmcS6QndVxB1ZHrt2U_CzeKFqxRSqP-ylm-j5nmseJ1L6l-vVNCu2ZOvh68qJGynji0p6iEyOv8Ri5eFfKKi3yV3BH2ONLZ2E7eNccTyWx6Y9rvNo8kG4Z1t9eR" alt=""></p>
<p>Once again, Swimm will let you compare your solution to the original codebase. Now that you named the PBA and implemented it, the next step is to make sure that it actually shows up in the configuration. So, let’s move on to the fourth step, where you will be adding details about your PBA.</p>
<h2>Add Details About Your New PBA</h2>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_eTNZp-OGjYt84lmYqnQZR9_TB2QWd_I7X9T5i9cyLvDdi9vSt-2fdDdFvhdlPkG_REI1Iq9vSKoPzyACek-EqstoIe6FbZxj8wFgIhTPMf_NYUqZpyNKK0rSBiixcwsJ5mZ2bcO" alt=""></p>
<p>This is actually a pretty good example of how learning begets learning. Whenever you are trying to learn something new, you come across new terms, new terminology, and you look it up and research it. The MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique is something you will encounter a lot and you need to be ready for it.</p>

<p>“The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework is an open-source knowledge base of attack tactics and techniques which were derived from real-world scenarios. This is something professionals in the cybersecurity industry refer to a lot." - Shreya Malviya</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this particular example, the “schedule jobs” PBA is related to two MITRE techniques that are shown in the description with their IDs. They basically do what the PBA does - scheduling jobs for Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>"Deep Reckonings" is Stephanie Lepp's art project: she's created three deepfake videos in which three of the current moment's most clueless powerful monsters have a moral reckoning and make a clean breast of their failings.</p>
<p><a href="https://the.ink/p/breaking-mark-zuckerberg-brett-kavanaugh">https://the.ink/p/breaking-mark-zuckerberg-brett-kavanaugh</a></p>
<p>First is Brett Kavanaugh, relating the evolution of his understanding of what sexual abuse means and his own history of sexual abuse, apologizing to the survivors of his crimes.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/kavanaughanimation.gif?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nErNatAdfSw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nErNatAdfSw</a></p>
<p>Next is Mark Zuckerberg, realizing that he's been kidding himself all along about the nature of Facebook, and the intrinsic harm that his business-model inflicts on the people he has imprisoned in his walled garden.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/zuckfakeanimation.gif?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El7_uF-sGWE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El7_uF-sGWE</a></p>
<p>Finally, there's Alex Jones, realizing that his quest to root out real conspiracies led him down a path of exploiting his audience and his victims with off-the-rails conspiracism.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/alexjonesanimation.gif?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WNuxGXw22w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WNuxGXw22w</a></p>
<p>Here's Lepp's statement on her pieces:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.deepreckonings.com/statement.html">http://www.deepreckonings.com/statement.html</a></p>
<p>"Where I see the greatest untapped potential for prosocial synthetic media is in a capacity that emerges across all three categories: to envision and elicit the change we wish to see."</p>
<p>This really resonates with me, especially in light of my latest novel, ATTACK SURFACE, the tale of cybermercenary who confronts her lifelong legacy of complicity in human rights abuses and tries to find redemption:</p>
<p><a href="https://attacksurface.com/">https://attacksurface.com/</a></p>
<p>And in light of my next novel, THE LOST CAUSE, about truth and reconciliation with white nationalist militias after a successful GND transformation.</p>

<p>It is such a balm, inhabiting these fictional places in which the crises that haunt me today are being addressed — painfully, imperfectly, but still: confronted rather than being left to fester.</p>

<p>My latest Locus Magazine column is "Past Performance is Not Indicative of Future Results," an essay about the limits of machine learning and the reason that statistical inference will not lead to consciousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2020/11/cory-doctorow-past-performance-is-not-indicative-of-future-results/">https://locusmag.com/2020/11/cory-doctorow-past-performance-is-not-indicative-of-future-results/</a></p>
<p>At its core, machine-learning is "theory free correlation-detection" – that is, it takes training data and finds things that appear together in it. Two things labeled an eye and one thing labeled a nose and one thing labeled a mouth all add up to a face.</p>
<p>But the classifier doesn't know what a noses, eyes, or mouths are. It doesn't know what a face is. Your doorbell camera doesn't know that the face-like thing in the melting snow on your walk <em>can't</em> be a face, so it repeatedly warns you about a stranger on your doorstep.</p>
<p>That theory-free-ness, combined with the abstruse mathematics of statistics, is what gets "AI" into so much trouble. Give machine learning classifiers of all the successful people at your company and it will tell you to hire people like them.</p>
<p>But if you've been missing great people due to bias, that is terrible advice – and it's got the veneer of empiricism. Remember when AOC got tons of shit from far-right assholes for calling an algorithm racist? How can math be racist?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/64621-how-algorithms-can-be-racist.html">https://www.livescience.com/64621-how-algorithms-can-be-racist.html</a></p>
<p>Theory-free isn't good enough. To understand what's happening in a complex situation, you haven't to be an anthropologist, not just a statistician. You need what Clifford Geertz called "thick description" – the qualitative accounts of the quantitative phenomenon.</p>
<p>Quantitative researchers are infamous for screwing this up. The qualitative elements are hard to do math on, so they incinerate them and leave behind a quantitative residue and do math on that, assuming it will be sufficient. It's (usually) not.</p>
<p>That's why exposure notification isn't contact tracing: knowing that two Bluetooth radios were close to each other for 15 minutes doesn't tell you if they were swapping spit or stuck in adjacent, sealed automobiles in a traffic jam.</p>
<p>Using theory-free inference to understand the world doesn't and can't lead to comprehension. "Theory-free" is the opposite of comprehension. We may not have a universal, agreed-upon definition of "artificial intelligence" but "understanding" is definitely a part of it.</p>
<p>Machine-learning classifiers have done amazing things to automate away a ton of drudgery, just as smiths did amazing things to shape metal. But smiths couldn't make reliable internal combustion engines. Incremental improvements in metal-beating don't evolve into machining.</p>
<p>Reliably turning out the precision components that produced engines needed casting and machining. Getting there required a shift in approaches, not improvement in the existing approach.</p>
<p>Theory-free statistical inference does a lot of good stuff – and produces a lot of bad outcomes – but the idea that if we do enough of it we'll get artificial intelligence is fundamentally wrong.</p>

<p>Amazon's ACX is a self-serve audiobook production platform:  writers spend thousands of dollars to produce audiobooks of their own work. Amazon strongly incentivizes ACX producers to sell exclusively through Audible (which also distributes to Itunes).</p>
<p>If you go exclusive, you get a better split of the proceeds – 40%. That's right: though you bore all production costs and Amazon has no costs associated with selling your audiobook, Amazon still keeps the majority of the revenue from it, even if you grant them exclusivity.</p>
<p>As unfair as that may sound, it gets a LOT worse. As part of its effort to lure customers to Audible, Amazon now grants no-questions-asked returns on audiobooks, and claws back the lost revenue from those returns from the audiobook creators.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.susanmaywriter.net/single-post/audiblegate-the-incredible-story-of-missing-sales">https://www.susanmaywriter.net/single-post/audiblegate-the-incredible-story-of-missing-sales</a></p>
<p>Amazon's return policy is very generous: you can return an audiobook for a full refund for a full year after you buy it. When you finish the book, the Audible app even shows you a "return book" button. Hit it and you get a refund.</p>
<p>But Amazon won't tell its authors how many returns they're getting. The only way to estimate is to sell a book for a month, take it out of circulation the next month, and see how far below zero the book's net sales are in a month when it isn't even for sale.</p>
<p>If you sold 10 copies in April, take the book off the market, and "sell" -5 copies in May, your returns are probably 50%.</p>
<p>This is the system creators have bootstrapped because Amazon, the world's most aggressive retail data-collector, somehow can't provide this number.</p>
<p>These authors spend thousands of dollars though an Amazon self-publishing platform, then the company conspires with unscrupulous readers to confiscate their payments, making the system more attractive off the backs of creators.</p>
<p>And here's the sting in the tail: if you opt for "Amazon exclusive," you are locked in for <em>seven years</em>. Amazon silently made the switch to "no hassle returns" and clawed back half its creators' money, with no chance to opt out.</p>
<p>Amazon gets to change its deal with creators when it wants to, but the creators don't get to change their deal with Amazon. For seven years after they produce their own audiobooks, they are locked to Amazon, regardless of Amazon's policy changes.</p>
<p>Seven.</p>
<p>Years.</p>
<p>Audible controls 90% of the audiobook market.</p>

<p>Today on Xkcd, an "Election Impact Score Sheet" that turns on the theory that "reminders from friends and family to vote have a bigger effect on turnout than anything campaigns do."</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2380/">https://xkcd.com/2380/</a></p>
<p>It's a call to action: if you have friends or family PA, ME, AK, MT, NM, WI, MI, IO, NC, NH, GA, NE, MI, FL, KS, MI or CO, drop them a line today – text, call, email – and remind them to vote. Prioritize these calls in roughly that order.</p>
<p>If the people you reach need help with their plan to vote, refer them to a guide like this one, and help them work through it, figuring it out together.</p>
<p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/how-to-vote-2020/</a></p>
<p>If you remind two PA voters, the predicted impact on the election is as if you yourself had two votes.  For every 2.5 voters in AZ, ME or NE you remind, that's also predicted to shift the tally by one extra vote.</p>
<p>As the tooltip explains: "You might think most people you know are reliable voters, or that your nudge won't convince them, and you will usually be right. But some small but significant percentage of the time, you'll be wrong, and that's why this works."</p>

<p>I've been talking to Polygon's Tasha Robinson about my books for nearly two decades. She was one of the reviewers to dig into Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, my debut novel, all the way back in 2003 when she was at The Onion's AV Club.</p>

<p>She's always had smart things to say about my books (and is never shy about criticizing them) so I was delighted to talk with her about my latest, ATTACK SURFACE, for an interview: "Cory Doctorow on his drive to inspire positive futures."</p>

November 4, 2020 | https://ma.ttias.be/double-clicking-on-the-web/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ma.ttias.be/double-clicking-on-the-web/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Here’s a usability feature for the web: disable double-clicks on links and form submits.</p>
<p>Before you think I’m a complete idiot, allow me to talk some sense into the idea.</p>
<h2 id="the-double-click-outside-the-web">The Double-click Outside The Web</h2>
<p>Everywhere in the Operating System, whether it’s Windows or Mac OSX, the default behaviour to navigate between directories is by double-clicking them. We’re trained to double-click anything.</p>
<p>Want to open an application? Double-click the icon. Want to open an e-mail in your mail client? Double-click the subject. <strong>Double-clicks everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>Except on the web. The web is a single-click place.</p>
<h2 id="double-the-click-twice-the-fun">Double The Click, Twice The Fun</h2>
<p>We <em>know</em> we should only single-click a link. We <em>know</em> we should only click a form submit once. But sometimes, we double-click. Not because we do so intentionally, but because our brains are just hardwired to double-click everything.</p>
<p><strong>For techies like us, a double-click happens by accident.</strong> It’s an automated double-click, one we don’t really think about. One we didn’t mean to do.</p>
<p>For lesser-techies, also know as the <em>common man or woman</em>, double-clicks happen all the time. The user doesn’t have a technical background, so they don’t know the web works with single-clicks. Or perhaps they do, and don’t see the harm in double-clicking.</p>
<p><strong>But default browser behaviour is to accept user input. However foolish it may be.</strong></p>
<p>If you accidentally double-click a form submit, you submit it twice. It’s that simple.</p>
<pre>10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:06 +0400] "POST /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 0 
10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:07 +0400] "POST /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 0</pre>
<p>If you double-click a link, it opens twice.</p>
<pre>10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:06 +0400] "GET /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 9105 
10.0.1.1 - - [18/Apr/2015:00:37:07 +0400] "GET /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 9104</pre>
<p>The problem is <em>sort of</em> solved with fast servers. If the page loads fast enough, the next page may already be downloading/rendering, so the second click of that double-click is hitting some kind of <em>void</em>, the limbo in between the current and the next page.</p>
<p>For slower servers, that just take more time to generate a response, a double-click would still happen and re-submit or re-open a link.</p>
<h2 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h2>
<p>I recently filed a feature request at <a href="https://www.nucleus.be/en">our</a> devs for a similar problem.</p>
<p>If you <em>accidentally</em> (and we’ve all done this) double-click a form submit, you submit it twice. That means whatever action was requested, is executed by the server twice.</p>
<p>The fix client-side is relatively simple, to disable the form submit button after the first submit was registered. There’s a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2830542/prevent-double-submission-of-forms-in-jquery/2830812#2830812">simple jquery snippet</a> that can solve this for you.</p>
<pre>$(document).ready(function(){
    $("form").submit(function(){
        setTimeout(function() {
            $('input').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
            $('a').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
        }, 50);
    })
});
</pre>
<p>Server-side, a fix could be to implement some kind of rate limiting or double-submit protection within a particular timeframe. <strong>Server-side, this is a much harder problem to solve.</strong></p>
<p>It’s 2015, why is this even a thing to consider?</p>
<h2 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>I can not think of a single reason why something like a form submit should have to be executed twice as a result of a <em>double-click</em>.</p>
<p>For a slow responding server, it’s reasonable for a user to hit the <em>submit</em> again after more than a few seconds have passed and no feedback has been given. Because of the lack of visual feedback that the request is still being processed, the expectation has been raised that the form submit did not work.</p>
<p>So the user submits again, thinking he must have made a mistake the first attempt. If the same form submit has been registered by the browser in less than 2 seconds, surely that must have been a mistake and would count as an <em>accidental double-click</em>?</p>
<p>Why should every web service implement a <em>double-click protection</em>, either client-side or server-side, and reinvent the wheel? Wouldn’t this make for a great browser feature?</p>
<p><strong>What if a double-click is blocked by default, and can be enabled again by setting a new attribute on the form?</strong></p>
<pre>&lt;form action="/something.php" allowmultiplesubmits&gt;
...
&lt;form&gt;
</pre>
<p>Setting the <strong>allowmultiplesubmits</strong> attribute causes the browser to allow multiple submits to the same form in the same page, and by default the browser has some kind of flood/repeat/double-click protection to prevent this.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m over thinking it and this isn’t an issue. But anyone who’s active on the web has, at one point, accidentally double-clicked. And I think we’ve got all the technology available to fix that, once and for all.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604476219745/qjpQ1Awv1.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>In programming, the async/await pattern may be a syntactic feature of the many programming languages that permits an asynchronous, non-blocking function to be structured in a way almost like a standard synchronous function. it's semantically associated with the concept of a coroutine and is usually implemented using similar techniques, and is primarily intended to supply opportunities for the program to execute other code while expecting a long-running, asynchronous task to finish, usually represented by promises or similar data structures. The feature is found in C# 5.0, Python 3.5, Hack, Dart, Kotlin 1.1, Rust 1.39,[1] Nim 0.9.4[2], and JavaScript ES2017, with some experimental add extensions, beta versions, and particular implementations of Scala[3] and C++.</p>
<p>Asynchronous programming may be a sort of parallel programming that permits a unit of labor to run separately from the first application thread. When the work is complete, it notifies the most thread (as well as whether the work was completed or failed). There are numerous benefits to using it, like improved application performance and enhanced responsiveness.</p>
<p>The main benefits of asynchronous programming using async / await include the following:</p>
<p>Increase the performance and responsiveness of your application, particularly once you have long-running operations that don't require to dam the execution. during this case, you'll perform other work while expecting the result from the long-running task.</p>
<p>Organize your code in a neat and readable way significantly better than the boilerplate code of the traditional thread creation and handling. with async / await, you write less code and your code is going to be more maintainable than using the previous asynchronous programming methods like using plain tasks.</p>
<p>async / await is that the newer replacement to BackgroundWorker, which has been used on windows forms desktop applications.</p>
<p>You make use of the most recent upgrades of the language features, as async / await was introduced in C# 5, and there are some improvements added to the feature like for every async and generalized async type like ValueTask.</p>
<p>The non-blocking programming
when you have long-running operations that don't require to dam the execution. during this case, you'll perform other work while expecting the results of the long-running task.</p>
<p>Imagine that we've two program flow and that they can add parallel without blocking one another.</p>
<p>Example: for instance that we'd like to log every error appear but at an equivalent time this could not block the flow so therein case we will log and return a message at an equivalent time.</p>
<p>the advantage of thread management in async/await programming
we know that in normal programming (blocking), every line of code is obstructing everything after it until it finishes the method albeit we've different flows (two flows with none dependency). but in async/await programming, the appliance won't block this thread, in other words, they're going to release it to try another work and when the function finishes the work any free thread will handle the response.</p>
<p>“Basically you'll use Asynchronous programming except when the next conditions are true…”</p>
<p>You are aiming for simplicity instead of efficiency.
You are looking to run simple or short-running operations.
Asynchronous programming won't provide benefit and truly will end in additional overhead on operations that are primarily CPU operations instead of people that involve network or overhead.</p>
<p>In Conclusion
Async/await is one of the foremost revolutionary features that are added to JavaScript within the past few years. It causes you to realize what a syntactical mess promises are and provides an intuitive replacement.</p>
<p>Concerns
Some valid skepticism you would possibly have about using this feature is that it makes asynchronous code less obvious: Our eyes learned to identify asynchronous code whenever we see a callback or a .then, it'll take a couple of weeks for your eyes to regulate to the new signs, but C# had this feature for years and other people who are conversant in it know it’s worth this minor, temporary inconvenience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    <p>As technology becomes more and&nbsp; more prevalent inside our homes; everything from speakers, to TVs, to washing&nbsp; machines, fridges, light bulbs, doorbells, thermostats, and even fish tanks&nbsp; are being connected to the internet. This comes with some risk. Hackers can now break&nbsp; into your home without ever setting food in it. In this article, I'm going to give you some tips&nbsp; on how to protect yourself and your family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This article is&nbsp; the third in a series of how to protect yourself from hackers. The first two cover <a href="https://techplanet.today/post/how-to-protect-your-online-accounts">protecting your&nbsp; online accounts</a> and your <a href="https://techplanet.today/post/how-to-protect-your-devices-from-hackers">devices from hackers</a>, respectively; so don't forget to check those out&nbsp; as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First up, let me say that I love technology and I&nbsp; have quite a few networked gadgets all around my home. The thing is... I've been working with technology&nbsp; for a long time. I'm used to evaluating products, assessing their security, and designing a safe topology within which they can be deployed. Companies... some companies take a lot of care to&nbsp; ensure they are not compromising the security of their systems when they do this; and will bring in&nbsp; outside expertise to make sure they get it right. You can't expect the same sort of rigor&nbsp; to be applied by the general public.</p>
<p>Who goes to the shop to buy a washing machine, and has a security consultant come and perform an assessment of it's networked services? This sort of&nbsp; thing catches companies out all the time. There's an American casino that got hacked because of&nbsp; an internet-connected fish tank in its lobby.</p>
<p>The buzzword for this growing collection&nbsp; of devices that hook themselves up the internet is called the "internet of things" or&nbsp; IoT for short. If it can catch a casino with a dedicated security team flat-footed, your average&nbsp; consumer at home is definitely at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that a lot of the time this&nbsp; internet connectivity is included as an afterthought. Washing machines aren't getting&nbsp; designed around their network connectivity. They're designed primarily around their ability&nbsp; to wash clothes, and then other factors like energy efficiency and noise. So you've got a decent&nbsp; design for your washing machine and then you find out your competitor's has an app.</p>
<p>Marketing&nbsp; say you need an app too. Right... what's the cheapest thing we can buy to stick in there and make&nbsp; it internet-connected so we can have an app too? As you may have guessed, the cheapest&nbsp; thing is not usually the most secure thing . There are a lot of devices on the market&nbsp; with really cheap and nasty connectivity. That leaves you exposed.</p>
<p>There are some horrible&nbsp; stories floating around of people being watched in their own homes, through their own cameras, by&nbsp; strangers on the internet. Of people coming into their child's bedroom to overhear some creep&nbsp; talking to them through the baby monitor. There are stories of people having their thermostats messed&nbsp; with - cranking up or cutting off the heat in the baby's room.</p>
<p>If your internet-connected fridge is&nbsp; set to holiday mode or your thermostat is set to away mode, a burglar could know when it's safe&nbsp; to break in... if they need to break in at all. If you've got a smart lock and it gets compromised,&nbsp; they may as well have a key. If just one of these devices gets compromised, it can be used to attack&nbsp; everything else on your home network.</p>
<p>My goal here isn't to scare you. More to get you to think&nbsp; about the devices you've got on your home network, and what risk they might pose. This isn't a joke,&nbsp; and it's not the case you'll be saved by anonymity. There is literally a <a href="https://www.shodan.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">search engine</a> that anyone can&nbsp; use that scans the internet for insecure devices. You can use it to search for vulnerable&nbsp; devices in people's homes and it will tell you what they are, where they are, and how to&nbsp; access them. It's that easy.&nbsp;So what can we do?</p>
<h2>Reputation &amp; Account Security</h2>
<p>First of all, do a bit of research on the company&nbsp; who made the product. If you Google your internet connected products, do a whole host of horror&nbsp; stories come up? That might be a good sign not to buy it. Now I should point out that just&nbsp; because a few people got hacked doesn't mean there's something wrong with the product itself. A&nbsp; lot of the time the device is fine but the person who got hacked was using a terrible password, and it was there account that got compromised.</p>
<h2>Default Passwords</h2>
<p>It does lead me onto the topic of default passwords, though. When you get a new device;&nbsp; always, always change the default password. Some devices these days come with a random password&nbsp; instead of the same password for every customer. Change it anyway. Some of these are not as random&nbsp; as they seem. In some cases there are only a handful of different passwords, and they just cycle through&nbsp; them. In others, those random looking letters and numbers are actually the device's physical MAC address (not to be confused with an Apple Mac). The problem with using the MAC address is that's&nbsp; how other devices in the network connect to it, so it can't be a secret - it's actively advertised. In the case of a wireless router, it is blasting that MAC address across the airwaves for anyone&nbsp; to see. Change the password!</p>
<p>If you don't change the password, it's like leaving your front door&nbsp; open with a sign saying "please don't rob me". When one of those scanners find your device on the&nbsp; internet, you can guarantee the first thing they're going to do is try and log in with the default&nbsp; password. This isn't just for home users.</p>
<p>In years gone by I used to onboard a lot of new customers&nbsp; for our support team at work. There were always devices on the network that weren't documented, and more often than not I was able to get into them just by trying a few default passwords. Printers are a big culprit in the corporate world.</p>
<h2>Firmware Updates</h2>
<p>The next thing you should do with any network-connected device is check for software or firmware updates. Anything with network connectivity should&nbsp; receive updates. No software is ever perfect, and as flaws are discovered that can be exploited, the&nbsp; vendor should be providing updates to fix them. On your computer or your phone, the updates&nbsp; are probably pushed to you; so you don't have to do much other than agree to them.</p>
<p>For a&nbsp; lot of IoT devices, though, this isn't the case; so you have to remember to check yourself&nbsp; and install any updates, manually. This is a good thing to check before you buy. How does&nbsp; a device get updated? If it's automatic, great! You're good. If it's a manual process then plan&nbsp; to be in the habit of checking and applying them. If there is no way for it to receive updates, don't&nbsp; buy it! That's a sure sign they've shoehorned in the cheapest bit of connectivity they could find,&nbsp; and didn't bother to think about security at all. This is important.</p>
<p>A quick search for camera I own&nbsp; shows 35 different vulnerabilities that have been reported that affect it, specifically. Fortunately, my device has been updated to protect against them; but only because i went to the manufacturer's&nbsp; website, downloaded the new firmware, and installed it on my camera. Otherwise that would&nbsp; be 35 different ways to try and break into my home.</p>
<h2>Features you don't need</h2>
<p>Speaking of my camera, here's another tip. If you don't need internet connectivity, turn it off. The camera I'm talking&nbsp; about is used as a baby monitor. It has an internet-connected feature that lets&nbsp; me check my baby from anywhere in the world. That's... not a feature I'm ever going to use. The&nbsp; way I see it, if I'm in a position of needing to use the internet connectivity, I'm not in a&nbsp; position to be able to comfort my child anyway, so what's the point? If that's enabled,&nbsp; it's open for anyone in the world to try and abuse it. So because I don't use that&nbsp; feature, I've turned its internet connectivity off. I don't need that to use it in my own home.</p>
<p>So take&nbsp; a look at your devices, and the features they offer. Turning off every feature you don't actually&nbsp; use can dramatically reduce the attack surface of your home.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wireless Security</h2>
<p>The heart of most home networks is of course&nbsp; your router. Technically speaking, it's probably a combined router, switch, firewall, wireless access&nbsp; point, and modem; but we'll stick with the name "router". Hopefully you've taken my earlier&nbsp; advice, and you've already changed both its administrative password and the password for the&nbsp; wireless network. There's more to it than just the password itself, though. Most routers come with&nbsp; various levels of security that can be enabled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for most home readers, the default&nbsp; setting is to enable all of them. This is simply because a lot of home users would get confused if&nbsp; asked to choose their own settings, so the router makers just switch everything on to make it as&nbsp; easy as possible for people to get up and running. The downside of course is that by enabling&nbsp; options with weak security, you also make it easier for hackers to get in, too.</p>
<p>The most likely&nbsp; options you'll have for wireless security are WEP, WAP, and WAP2. The latest devices may also support&nbsp; WPA3. There are variations on these including personal and enterprise versions. For most home&nbsp; users you'll be after the personal version that uses a pre-shared key. Enterprise versions are&nbsp; aimed at businesses and are more secure, but require more knowledge and infrastructure to&nbsp; set up.</p>
<p>The general rule to follow is that you want to start with the most secure, work your way&nbsp; down, and only enable the security options that are absolutely necessary to allow your devices to&nbsp; connect.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/11/5fa277d2282ac.webp" alt="How To Protect Your Smart Home" width="508" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/11/5fa277d2282ac.webp">WAP3 is the latest and greatest so if you have that, turn it on. A lot of devices at this time&nbsp; are not going to support it, so you'll almost certainly want to enable WPA2 as well. For&nbsp; the time being at least. In most cases you won't need to enable vanilla WAP. WPA2 has been around&nbsp; for 16 years, so it's pretty well supported. If in doubt, keep WAP1 turned off and see if everything&nbsp; works. If it doesn't, try reconnecting the …</p></article></div>

November 4, 2020 | https://tomgamon.com/posts/is-it-morally-wrong-to-write-inefficient-code/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tomgamon.com/posts/is-it-morally-wrong-to-write-inefficient-code/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In this post I will explore the idea that because running code contributes to global warming, writing inefficient code is morally wrong<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I will start by outlining the argument, before working through each of the premises in turn to see how they hold up. I will then conclude that even if we cannot concretely defend every premise in this first iteration, then it is sufficiently plausible that it should at least make us pause for thought. With that said, let’s dive in!</p><p>The argument I am considering, in summary, can be presented as:</p><ol><li>Running code produces greenhouse gasses, proportional to the computing resources it requires.</li><li>Greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming.</li><li>Global warming increases the suffering of others.</li><li>Therefore, increasing your consumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li><li>Inefficient code increases your consumption of computing resources.</li><li>Therefore, inefficient code increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li><li>Increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is morally wrong.</li><li>Therefore, writing inefficient code is morally wrong.</li></ol><p>I believe the argument as laid out above is valid, in that the conclusions follow from the premises, so we will focus our energies on determining if it is sound, that is all the premises are true. We will now break it down and look at each premise more carefully.</p><blockquote><ol><li>Running code produces greenhouse gasses, proportional to the computing resources it requires.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The first premise is based on the fact that running code requires electricity. Electricy, in large, requires the burning of fossil fuels, which releases a number of greenhouse gasses. There are cases where this is not the case (solar energy, wind energy), and in such cases, this argument is invalid. However, if you run your code on AWS, then it is very likely that you are running on fossil fuels<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. As AWS is the largest provider of cloud computing, this is likely to be true in a good number of cases.</p><blockquote><ol start="2"><li>Greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming.</li><li>Global warming increases the suffering of others.</li></ol></blockquote><p>With regards to the second and third premises, these are statements which are consistent with the overwhelming scientific consensus, and as such are uncontroversial. For the sake of completeness, here are some supporting statements from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf">2014 climate change report summary</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emphasis mine.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history</strong>. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia</strong>. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems</strong>. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems.</strong> Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development.</p></blockquote><p>I believe these to be enough to support the argument that greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming, and that global warming will increase suffering of the human and other animal populations.</p><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>Therefore, increasing your consiumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li></ol></blockquote><p>So here we come to our first conclusion, that increasing ones consumption of computing resources increases ones contribution to the suffering of others. It is based on at least two implicit premises. The first is that if A contributes to B, and B causes C, A contributes to C. The second is that in such a transitive relationship, if you increase your contribution to A then you increase your contribution to C. To illustrate, we can imagine a much more straightforward case. Imagine that I have a dial which, when turned, increases the voltage supplied to an electric chair. There are several such dials, and their contributions are additive. It would be fair to say that if I turned up my dial, I am contributing to the suffering of whoever is in that electric chair.</p><p>Given this assertion, it would seem reasonable that if running code produces greenhouse gasses, and greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming, then running code contributes to global warming. Global warming increases the suffering of others, so it follows that running code increases ones contribution to the suffering of others.</p><blockquote><ol start="5"><li>Inefficient code increases your consumption of computing resources.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Premise five seems relatively uncontroversial, though to simplify let us just consider the length of time some piece of code takes to run (in a similar way we assess algorithmic complexity). If an efficient version runs in 1 minute, and an inefficient version runs in 1 hour, it stands to reason that the inefficient version would consume more electricity.</p><blockquote><ol start="6"><li>Therefore, inefficient code increases your contribution to the suffering of others</li></ol></blockquote><p>With point six we again come to a relatively straightforward conclusion. If you agree with the earlier conclusion at point four and the premise at point five, then this falls out as a result of the logic of the statements.</p><blockquote><ol start="7"><li>Increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is morally wrong.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Point seven is the real crux of the argument, and on the surface intuitively plausible. In the above example with the dial, it would generally be considered morally wrong for you to dial up the dial and increase the suffering of the individual in the chair. However, if we are merely counting <em>contributions</em> to suffering, this casts a wide net. Would it be morally wrong not to buy an energy efficient bulb when an energy efficient one is available at the same price? How about breathing? This expels carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, but would generally not be considered a morally reprehensible action.</p><p>It seems that there is some inherent provision that increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is not morally wrong if it causes equal or greater personal suffering. For example, if there was some shared well of water, it would be reasonable to claim that it is not morally wrong of you to take a sip of water in order to save yourself from dehydration, even if that means other may become more dehydrated. However, if you drained the well, and threw that water away, causing another to die to dehydration, that seems morally wrong.</p><p>I think for the purposes of this post, we can consider this sufficiently true (there is definitely some sense in which it is true), even if is vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a> in it’s current form. Consider it the alpha version of the premise - solid enough to be useful, but not without it’s bugs.</p><blockquote><ol start="8"><li>Therefore, writing inefficient code is morally wrong.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Here we come to the conclusion of the argument, that writing inefficient code is morally wrong, which follows from the logic set out in the conclusion at point six and the premise at point seven. So what does this mean?</p><p>As discussed, I am aware that this argument is probably not watertight, and perhaps with some more time spent on it we could tighten it up<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. I think the premise at point seven could definitely be better defended, and there almost certainly some implicit premises and caveats that need to be put in place. However, I think it is reasonable enough that it should make us pause and reflect. Whilst a lot of code performance issues can be covered up with bigger and better hardware, these come at a greater cost than just an increased AWS bill. The decisions we make as developers have real world effects.</p><p>If there are ways that we can reduce ‘programming waste’ we should strive to do so, whether that is changing an algorithm to be <code>O(1)</code>, scaling down some cloud instances or killing of that Heroku dyno that’s not really doing anything useful<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Collectively we can make a real difference.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>I have had this idea knocking around for a while, but reading <a href="https://visitmy.website/2020/07/13/this-website-is-killing-the-planet/">this post</a> motivated me to explore it further.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Modern Art and Religion</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Modern art draws a clear boundary between religion and art. Religious contemporary literature is named a pseudo art or non-art in most circles.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the emergence of the neo-classical movement in Europe, a debate began about separating art and religion. With time, this led to the complete separation of religion and arts in the Modern and Post-Modern era.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Works of fiction moved away from all religious connotations. Modern art gradually donned a new skin - one dissociated from religion. New standards deemed it taboo to borrow metaphors, and anecdotes, from religious texts.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The separation of Art and Religion in our minds is like the separation of the church and the State. Politics, however, is very different. Where art is an organic living thing, politics is a mechanistic process. Art finds worth in emotions, beliefs, ideas, and cultures - it feels, laughs, cries, and believes; whereas politics looks after power, benefit, and in rare cases, the commonwealth.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Religion Shapes Art</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Literature and art were born in religious texts. <em>Rig Vedas</em>, <em>Quran</em>, and <em>the Bible</em> inspired Milton's <em>Paradise Lost</em>, Dante's <em>Divine Comedy</em>, Rumi's <em>Mathnavi</em>, the poetry of Hafiz, and so many other poets. Shelly's poetry uses metaphors from the <em>Greek Pantheon</em> and mythology, composing devout prayers appreciating nature's beauty.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Religion influenced even heretical works like Nietzsche's <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>. Zarathustra comes down from a mountain to proclaim God's death and an end to religion, but his language is archaic and Biblical. His very character is prophetic and religious - a sort of poetic contradiction.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In modern classical literature like <em>the Chronicles of Narnia</em> and <em>the Lord of the Rings</em>, religious symbolism shapes many characters. Biblical Prophets like Moses have encouraged fantastical characters like the wizard.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Religion affects us subconsciously, without us realizing it. It is no mere chance that religious symbols are present everywhere — in our songs, media, architecture, and even mannerisms. Our environments, cultures, and history shape our affinities, making us love Bach's <em>Art of Fugue</em>, Schubert's <em>Ave Maria</em>, and many other musical pieces, whether we are religious or not.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Great Art and Religion</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, religion alone cannot create great art. All great works of art, religious or irreligious, speak the true voice of the artist's heart — without propaganda. Be it atheism, religion, irreligion, or any other dogma, art should be built seamlessly like an organic thing — living and breathing a life of its own, adding beauty and a sense of completion to it.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We see this profundity and beauty in Rumi's <em>Mathnavi</em>. In the beginning, he seems a madman, but the more you read, the more sense it all makes until you start seeing everything with Rumi's eyes. Great art is like that — instantaneously living, never forced, and never artificial.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rumi &amp; Coleman Barks</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coleman Barks is an accurate representation of a modern artist. He takes Rumi's brilliance, forcefully tones it down to a mundane level, and presents it to us on a rusty platter. Barks blatantly molds Rumi's words into different meanings murdering their purpose. Majid Nafisi, a Persian scholar, is not wrong in saying:</span></p><blockquote><p>To remodel and fix Rumi for the American market, Barks follows the path of a New-Age Sufi. He tries to disconnect Rumi's mystical concepts from their historical and social backgrounds and modify them for our contemporary taste.</p><p>- <em>Coleman Barks and Rumi's Donkey</em>, Majid Nafisi</p></blockquote><p>The result is a completely different creation - one based on propaganda. Art does not oppose change; rather it <em>is</em> the herald of change and evolution, but when art is turned into Silver - docile, malleable, and controlled; it no longer remains art.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Art as an Organism</span></h2><blockquote><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A living thing never forgets its roots. You can shed its form, burn its flesh, and erase its memories, but the fundamental constituents: its mannerism, behaviors, and affinities go back to its roots, its history.</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Art is not a machine in a factory that can be reconfigured and changed with changing trends and ideologies. It is a living, breathing, evolving organism - an unconquerable heart driven by the artist's soul. Coercion, compulsion, lies, and hypocrisy cannot create art - only propaganda.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Though ideologies shape art when they influence the people, the process is gradual, evolving, and natural. Forced dogmas only kill its spirit leaving behind an empty shell.</span></p></div></div>]]>

<div>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Through dynamic loading, malware authors can covertly load malicious code into their application in order to avoid detection. We can detect such loading through the application’s /proc/[PID]/maps kernel generated file.<br>Recently, we created a simple script that allows us to detect dynamic loading in Android apps. This presented us with a good opportunity to discuss dynamic loading in general in this blog.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h2><strong>Dynamic Loading and Linking:</strong></h2>
<p>In order to understand the rest of the blog, it is important to go over the basics of linking and loading, and highlight the differences between linking vs. loading, and static vs. dynamic.<br></p>
<p><strong>What Is Linking:</strong></p>
<p>The process of compilation has multiple parts. Linking is the last step before we get a runnable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">executable</a>. A program is usually more than a simple self-contained file, and relies on other libraries or files to operate. As such, it’s not enough for you to compile your code into machine-code to be able to run it, but also to somehow <em>link</em> the different files into a cohesive executable.</p>
<p>How is this done in practice? After compilation and assembly, the assembler outputs object files, which usually correspond to each module in your program. Such files can be either relocatable or executable. Object files of the first variety have to undergo linking before they can be run but ones of the second type can be executed immediately. In the GNU/Linux ecosystem, the usual extension for an object file is .o. Shared object files, known as libraries, are relocatable object files that are intended to be used by many different programs, and can’t be run on their own. In GNU/Linux, they have the extension .so (Shared Object), whereas in Windows they have the .dll (Dynamic-link Library) extension.</p>
<p>The linker then takes the files, resolves the symbols (functions and variables), and points them to the correct memory addresses by writing everything down in the symbol table of the executable. For the sake of performance, it also <em>relocates</em> your code so that related pieces of code end up mapped to nearby memory addresses, regardless of how you originally organized your program, as human readability isn’t an issue anymore, and performance is the main priority.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Many Different Names of the Executable:</strong></p>
<p>In both Linux and Windows those seemingly different extensions have the same underlying formats as executables. In Windows, they are PEs (Portable Executable), and usually have the extensions .exe and .dll, and in Linux, they are ELFs (Executable and Linkable File), and have the extensions .bin, .so or .o (Yes, the object files we mentioned earlier are also ELFs).</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Linking:</strong></p>
<p>We say that something has been dynamically linked when instead of doing that process during compile-time, it is done in load-time or runtime. Which brings us to loading: a loader simply copies the contents of the linker’s output to memory, and runs the program. When dynamic linking is used, the linking process occurs just before loading, when running the program, which often leads to confusion between the two.<br> Dynamic loading, on the other hand, means that parts of the code can be loaded to memory at any point during runtime. The two processes can and frequently are done together.</p>
<p><strong>So Why Is This a Problem?</strong></p>
<div><p>Dynamic loading is certainly useful. For example, rather than loading all libraries your program will use at load-time, you could load them up only when you need to use them, thus using less memory, or only conditionally load them in certain cases.</p><p>But it also presents an easy way for malware developers to hide their malicious code. They can put all of their legitimate code in the APK, and move all of the nefarious code into a DEX (Dalvik Executable) that the application will download and then dynamically load during use and thus make their application appear innocuous upon basic static inspection of the APK.</p></div>
<p><strong>Android 10 Mitigation:</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, our wise overlords at Google decided to prevent such abuse by <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/behavior-changes-10">forbidding apps from loading executables</a> (ELFs like .so, .bin and so on) from their home directory – they can now (API level 29+) only load binary code that’s included in their APK.<br></p>
<p>DEX files, however, have not changed and can still be dynamically loaded, so the threat hasn’t been completely eliminated. Furthermore, apps are now forbidden from changing their binary code in-memory after it has been loaded.</p>
<p><strong>How are DEX Classes Loaded:</strong></p>
<p>Android offers an option for dynamically loading .dex files using a class called <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/dalvik/system/DexClassLoader">DexClassLoader</a>. To load a class, we simply need to write:<br></p>
<pre><code>// Init the loader
DexClassLoader dexClassLoader = new DexClassLoader(path_to_dex, null, null, parent_class);

// Load the class:
Class dynamic_class = dexClassLoader.loadClass("DynamicClass");

// Load a method we could call it
Method method = dynamic_class.getMethod("method1");</code></pre>
<p>And then we can use the method’s invoke() to use the method.<br></p>
<p><strong>The /proc/[PID]/maps File:</strong></p>
<p>In Unix, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file">everything is a file</a>, and even if it isn’t really one, it is handled and accessed like one. This includes the Kernel’s data structures, and Linux is no exception to the rule. The Linux Kernel allows us to access and read its data structures through the /proc/ <strong>pseudo-file system</strong>. Each process then has its own folder at /proc/[PID]. The files and subfolders here hold plenty of useful and important information about the process, but today we will focus on just one file: /proc/[PID]/maps.</p>
<p>/proc/[PID]/maps displays a chart of the mapped memory of a process. When we say mapped memory, we mean a virtual memory segment that has a one to one correspondence with a file. This mapping enables an application to modify and access files by reading and writing directly to memory. This means that when a program accesses a file, this will end up being recorded in its /proc/[PID]/maps file.</p>
<p>/proc/[PID]/maps also shows us what permissions the process has for each segment. This can help us determine which files the process edited and which files it has read.</p>
<p>Here is how a short segment of a normal /proc/PID/maps file looks:</p>

<p> Each row in the file records a single memory segment in the contiguous virtual memory address space allocated to the process. </p>
<ul><li><strong>Address </strong>– The first column shows the starting and ending address of the segment.</li><li><strong>Permissions</strong> – This column shows which permissions the process has for the segment. <em><strong>r/w/x</strong></em> are the usual read/write/execute, while the last letter is <strong>s</strong> or <strong>p</strong>, meaning shared or private, respectively.</li><li><strong>Offset</strong> – This is the offset from the beginning of the file, in order to be able to calculate the starting address of the mapped data. Sometimes, a segment isn’t mapped from a file (in which case the path column will have an identifier for the nature of the segment, as explained below), in which case the offset is simply left as 0.</li><li><strong>Device</strong> – When the segment was mapped from a file, the hex number of the device where the file is stored is displayed in this column.</li><li><strong>Inode (Index Node)</strong> – If the segment came from a file, this is the <a href="https://linuxhandbook.com/inode-linux/">inode number</a> of the file.</li><li><strong>Path</strong> – This is the path for the file, if there is one. This can be [heap], [stack] or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDSO">[vsdo]</a> if the segment is the eponymous structure.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Our Humble Script:</strong></p>
<p>In offending android applications, dynamic loading of code is usually done from the home directory of the application, so files loaded to memory from that dictionary (or other common locations) ought to appear in the maps file. To automate the task of checking that file, we constructed a very simple script that uses regex to search for the string ‘/data/data’ in the maps file of a given PID in the connected device and returns the lines that match. /data/data is of course the apps home directory where files and data are stored. It is the only location from which an app can load DEX files.<br></p>

<p>Interacting with ADB through Python was sometimes a challenge, as doing so using the shell can be awkward, but we found a useful set of tools called <a href="http://docs.pwntools.com/en/latest/">pwntools</a> that provide exactly that functionality.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Cloud Functions are Google’s offering for serverless architecture (similar to AWS lambdas).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-serverless">What is serverless?</h2>

<p>Before we look into how to use Cloud Functions, we should understand some things about it.</p>

<p>Code needs servers to run, so <code>serverless</code> doesn’t mean there are no servers, it means that we don’t need to manage those servers ourselves.</p>

<p>In a usual server based architecture, we might create a service and deploy it to a machine. This service will be running in the machine all the time waiting for requests. This has the disadvantage that even if there are no requests, the machine would need to be up, and incurring cost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we use Cloud Functions, we write a service and register it with Google. Google will then listen to the endpoint this service cares about and will only start it when there are requests. If it detects that there haven’t been requests for some time, it will stop the service again.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>While Google Compute Engine instances are billed by time, Cloud Functions are billed by execution time. If a Cloud Function is not being executed, then it is not being billed. This sounds very attractive, but there are draw backs, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Running a Compute Engine instance for a full month is most of the time cheaper than having a Cloud Function executing for one month straight. This means that if we need a service to be always doing work, it’s better to get a whole machine for it.</li>
  <li>Cloud Functions need to warm up. If a Cloud Function hasn’t been used for a while, Google will stop the server that was running it. Next time we get a new request, a new server needs to be started, which takes some time. This will make this first request take long (This time varies a lot, but usually less than 4 seconds)</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, serverless shouldn’t be used in all scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-cloud-function">Creating a Cloud Function</h2>

<p>To make it easy to work on our Cloud Function, we need a way to run the function from our development machine.</p>

<p>Let’s start by creating a module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>mkdir test-functions
cd test-functions
go mod init test.com/functions
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can create a file for our function:</p>



<p>With this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>functions</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>"net/http"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>DoYouLikeTacos</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprint</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"Of course I like tacos!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To be able to test our functions from our development machine, we need to create a server. Let’s create a file for it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>mkdir cmd
touch cmd/main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And add this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

  <span>// Our function will be executed when a request to /do-you-like-tacos is received</span>

      <span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>"/do-you-like-tacos"</span><span>,</span> <span>functions</span><span>.</span><span>DoYouLikeTacos</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>// The server will run on port 8080</span>
  <span>port</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"8080"</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To run the server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd cmd
go run main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the server is running, we can use curl to test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl localhost:8080/do-you-like-tacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>Of course I like tacos!
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example is very simple, but we can have our fucntion do whatever we want.</p>

<p>We can also add more functions by adding more files and updating our <code>main.go</code> server. Let’s create another function just to show it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd ..
touch cerveza.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And add this to <code>cmd/main.go</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre>  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>funcframework</span><span>.</span><span>RegisterHTTPFunctionContext</span><span>(</span>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run the server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd cmd
go run main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And hit the new url:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl localhost:8080/thirsty
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="deploying-to-google-cloud">Deploying to Google Cloud</h2>

<p>Once we have our functions ready, we want to make them available to the public by deploying them to Google Cloud.</p>

<p>From the root of our project we can use this command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud functions deploy DoYouLikeTacos \
    --runtime go113 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will spit out a bunch of information. The most important part is the URL:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>httpsTrigger:
  url: https://us-central1-proj-1234567.cloudfunctions.net/DoYouLikeTacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can curl this endpoint, the same way we did for our local endpoint:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl https://us-central1-proj-1234567.cloudfunctions.net/DoYouLikeTacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a closer look to the command we used to deploy our function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud functions deploy DoYouLikeTacos \
    --runtime go113 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>DoYouLikeTacos</code> is the name of the function we are deploying. The tool will search the package for a function with that name.</li>
  <li><code>--runtime go113</code> tells google to use Golang 1.13. We can see the available runtimes in the help (<code>gcloud functions deploy --help</code>)</li>
  <li><code>--trigger-http</code> means that an http endpoint will be assigned to the function</li>
  <li><code>--allow-unauthenticated</code> means that the function will be available for everybody without authentication. Note that the function code itself could expect some kind of authentication independently of this flag</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a quick introduction to Google Cloud Functions. We learned how to create a function, test it locally and deploy it to Google Cloud.</p>

<p>Complete applications can be built using Cloud Functions, so I’ll explore a little more in another article.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Our world is changing. Our problems are changing. It's time our education system did&nbsp;too. Here's my take on the reforms needed in education.</p><div><p>There is a storm brewing. And the rain clouds are hovering over the traditional school system. We’ve already seen the first droplets fall as a result of COVID-19, and it’s difficult to see a future where the downpour isn’t on the way.</p><p>The education system has been failing us for years. It is no secret that the outcome of the schooling process — “educated children” — is a complete mismatch with the outcome that this modern world requires. </p><p>We’re failing our children by subjecting them to this system, and we’re failing ourselves as humans by slowing down the overall development of our race, and everything we interact with. </p><h2>A Failed System</h2><p>To understand the education problem we’re now faced with, it’s important to understand the origins of education.</p><p>The formal education system (particularly in America) was born mainly from religion. Martin Luther was said to be the “godfather” of this. His justification was that in order for salvation to occur, people need to read the scriptures. He realized that in order for this to happen, people need to know how to read and write. This idea spread, and by the late 17th century, Germany was the leader in the development of formal education. However, the actual schooling was not handled by the state, but by the Lutheran Church.</p><blockquote>“In America, in the mid 17th century, Massachusetts became the first colony to mandate schooling, the clearly stated purpose of which was to turn children into good Puritans.” — Psychology Today</blockquote><p>As the idea of education spread, employer’s saw it as an opportunity to create educated workers for their companies. At the time, the ideal qualities of a worker were something along the lines of:</p><ul role="list"><li>Punctuality, </li><li>Obedience (take instructions),</li><li>Tolerance for long, tedious work hours,</li><li>Minimal ability to read and write.</li></ul><p>Aside from the last point, which has been significantly improve on, it’s hard to look at our formal education system (mostly) and see how it has adapted to the current world we live in, and our present day challenges.</p><h2>A Growing Trend</h2><p>The number of children being homeschooled in the UK has more than doubled in the last 5 years, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorrison/2020/03/06/fears-children-going-off-grid-as-homeschooling-up-by-700/#27cafb9554b4" target="_blank">Forbes</a>. In some parts of the country, that number is as high as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorrison/2020/03/06/fears-children-going-off-grid-as-homeschooling-up-by-700/#27cafb9554b4" target="_blank">700%</a>. This is only registered home-schoolers, which is not a requirement.</p><p>In the US, the current number of home-schooled students represents roughly 3.4% of the schooled population, or 2.3 million children. It’s expected that as a second generation of home-schoolers chooses the same for their kids, this number will expand to <a href="https://blog.steppingblocks.com/homeschooling-curriculum-and-programs-are-booming#:~:text=Homeschooling%20is%20catching%20on.,over%20the%20next%20few%20years." target="_blank">10 million by 2030.</a></p><p>Clearly, home schooling is finding popularity and traction outside of it’s traditional conservative and religious roots.</p><h2>A Changing World</h2><p>Bare with me for a second while I try illustrate a point with a personal anecdote. I left high-school 10 years ago. Throughout my schooling years, I found school particularly boring. In junior school, I remember faking stomach aches, headaches, putting my forehead above the toaster to mimic a temperature — every trick in the book to get out of school. I <em>hated </em>the monotony of it. Pretty soon I got shipped off to boarding school. </p><p>10 Years later, and I am staying with my parents during lockdown, and we became friends with our next-door neighbors, who had a daughter in Grade 11 (17 years old). She asked me for some help with her school work. </p><p>To my shock, the curriculum was all but identical to what I learned in high school. The only difference was that she had a laptop with her, and that’s how she got her notes from the teachers — no more note-packs. </p><h3>For perspective, 10 years ago…</h3><ul role="list"><li>There was no DoorDash (Founded 2013);</li><li>Amazon stock price was $139, it’s now $3162;</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5fa1700d4b1252d4e2a1ffc8_1*29zfMBVl365WGrYKOF_AEg.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Source: Google.com</figcaption></figure><ul role="list"><li>Scientists <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/gravitational-waves/en/#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20scientists%20detected%20gravitational,happened%201.3%20billion%20years%20ago." target="_blank">discovered gravitational waves exist</a> for the first time, when they observed two black holes colliding 1.5 billion years ago.</li><li>The only Tesla that was around was the original Roadster.

No matter the input (type of child), you get battered with information that is mostly not relevant anymore, through outdated teaching methods, and then are expected to come out a certain way (pass exams).</p><p>We’ve now reached a point in educational research that we know that all people learn differently. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5fa1700e09a79a0d525bd4fe_0*YsGK_hHeWUuWkxLs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Source:<a href="https://digitalhumans.com/blog/the-four-types-of-learning-how-digital-humans-cater-to-all-customers/" target="_blank"> Uneeq.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>The question then becomes: <em>So, what are the alternatives?</em></p><h3>Montessori</h3><p>Founded on the teaching principles of Dr Maria Montessori — the first female physician in Italy — the premise is that children are naturally inquisitive. They are born with “absorbent” minds, and will embark on self-directed learning if given the opportunity to do so.</p><p>Montessori’s are primarily at the pre-school and primary school level, and their ‘classrooms’ are prepared environments which allow children to seek out opportunities to learn on their own. The teachers are there as facilitators and observers. The children are allowed to concentrate for long periods of time on certain tasks, rather than being interrupted by a teacher-driven model of learning with class changes and interruptions— a foundation of the Montessori way of teaching. </p><p>The “Montessori method” is used in over 5000 schools in the US today. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324261991_Academic_Achievement_Outcomes_A_Comparison_of_Montessori_and_Non-Montessori_Public_Elementary_School_Students" target="_blank">A 2006 study</a> where a public Montessori school was compared to traditional public schools yielded results that the Montessori students yielded better academic results overall. Google co-founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Paige are both examples of the positive results that the Montessori method can yield.</p><h3>The Steiner/Waldorf Method</h3><p>Rudolf Steiner was the mind behind the “Steiner/Waldorf” method which emphasizes the importance of the development of the “whole child”. Steiner theorized that children developed in 7 year periods, and their education should be structure as such:</p><ul role="list"><li>The first 7 years of a child’s life are based around “imitative and sensory-based” learning, and should be devoted mainly to a child’s non-cognitive abilities.</li><li>Ages 7 to 14, creativity and imagination are emphasized.</li><li>From 14 onwards, students are ready for a more structure learning environment which “stresses social responsibility”.</li></ul><p>Steiner founded his first Waldorf school in Germany in 1919. The original curriculum was for 12 years, with an emphasis on preparation for “living”. Within 10 years, Steiner’s Waldorf school was the largest private school in Germany. When World War II hit, Waldorf teachers fled to neighboring countries, and the method spread.</p><p>There are however some criticisms of the Waldorf method, which say that it borders on being too religious. </p><h3>Reggio Emilia</h3><p>Sharing a lot of the same principles as the Montessori Method, Reggio Emilia also has its roots in a post World War II world. The method is primarily aimed at children aged 3 to 6. </p><p>The first Reggio Emilia preschool opened in 1945, and became popular in the US in 1991.</p><p>The Reggio Emilia way of teaching has the following features:</p><ul role="list"><li>Parents take an active role in education;</li><li>Schools are designed to look and feel like “home”</li><li>Curriculums are flexible;</li><li>Growth on the student’s terms is paramount.</li><li>Art is a big component, with almost all RE schools having a dedicated art teacher who is their creative ‘guide’.</li></ul><blockquote>“Reggio Emilia is about full-blown human potential and how you support that in both intellectual and creative terms.”- Louis Boyd Cadwell (Teacher at RE school’s in Italy during the 90's)</blockquote><h3>Sudbury </h3><p>Sudbury schools are unique in their emphasis of individuality and democracy. They take this to the next level. Sudbury students have complete control over what they do, and what they learn at school. All students and teachers vote on almost everything relating to the schooling process:</p><ul role="list"><li>Budget,</li><li>Curriculum, </li><li>Teacher hiring/firing.</li></ul><p>The premise is that students are capable of making sound collective decisions. In the event that they don’t, they learn through the consequences of their mistakes. </p><p>Sudbury Schools rely on the premise that students are inherently motivated to learn. Their reasoning is often backed by the idea that an infant child learns to walk, rather than spending it’s whole life lying down in it’s crib — which is a viable, and easier, option.</p><h2>Predictions for the Future</h2><p>The issue with all of these alternative learning methods is that they don’t align with the way companies are viewing graduates. Traditionally, you would have to go through school in order to get a certain qualification. That qualification would give you a ‘stamp’ which a company could look at and gauge how well you may be able to do the job. </p><p>That is slowly changing. Alternative education institutions like Lambda School are changing the way companies are hiring. It’s no longer necessary for front-end developers to have a secondary education at all. If you’ve got the skills to do the job — it doesn’t matter to them how you got them. </p><p>The same applies in the marketing world. If you are a creative thinker that can create designs and think laterally where no one else can — your education doesn’t …</p></div></div>

November 3, 2020 | https://blog.moeminmamdouh.com/how-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website-side-project-edition | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.moeminmamdouh.com/how-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website-side-project-edition">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>You've been working on your side project for nearly 6 months now, launch date's today. You're super excited to show the world what you've been working on, you hit the launch button and...no traffic or users at all.</p>


<p>It's a common problem. Us IndieHackers <em>know</em> where to advertise our products, but not all of us know <em>how</em> to post our products. I've split up this blog post to two <strong>categories</strong>: </p>
<p> 👉 How to get a huge traffic boost for a short period of time with little to no work.
 👉 How to get steady traffic by using long-term strategies. </p>

<p>This is a great way to not only gain traffic, but also to validate your idea (if you haven't already). There are hundreds of directories all over the internet that you can post your side project to and in return get huge traffic boosts. Let me go over where to post your side projects, the pros and cons of posting on said websites, and <em>how</em> to post on said websites.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-post-your-side-projects">Where To Post Your Side Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://betalist.com/">Betalist</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://betapage.co/">Betapage</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sideprojectors.com/">Sideprojectors</a>, yes, you can showcase your projects on Sideprojectors.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://launched.io/SubmitStartup">Launched</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.saashub.com/">SaaSHub</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are hundreds more websites you can submit your side projects to, but let's keep it simple for the sake of keeping this blog post short and sweet.</p>
<h3 id="pros-and-cons-of-posting-on-directories">Pros and Cons of Posting On Directories</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free huge traffic boost and all that comes with it. Be it sales, newsletter subscriptions, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Short term traffic. You could very well succeed on Reddit, HackerNews, and ProductHunt and you'd be set for a good week or so, but it'll be drought season afterwards.</li>
<li>Wrong audience. You're not necessarily targeting the 'optimal' audience by posting your side project on all these websites. </li>
</ul>
<p>Should you do it? Short answer, yes. Long answer, yes. Despite the low quality of traffic, you'll still be seeing a good portion of your target audience on these platforms. You're not really paying to submit on these platforms, so do it, if it works, good on you. If not, you should have a backup plan (second category in this blog post). </p>
<h3 id="how-to-post-on-these-platforms">How To Post On These Platforms</h3>
<p>I've been waiting for this section. Let's assume you're releasing a website performance monitoring tool called Monitr. Things you should not do:</p>
<p>❌ Do not post your URL on all platforms meaninglessly. </p>
<p>Yup, that's it. So how do you share your product? Well, on websites such as ProductHunt, BetaPage and so on, there really isn't much you can do other than post the URL, but on community-based websites such as IndieHackers, Reddit, and HackerNews, there's so much room for creativity.</p>
<p>i.e. A post about website performance and its role in improving organic traffic with a link at the end of the article. More often than not, well thought out articles will rise to the top and your link will gain exposure. If not, you've added value to the community and you aren't really spamming your link. The mods will not be on your back.</p>
<p>Repurpose the content, you've written the blog post, will you go post that 1000+ article on Facebook/Twitter? No, try to make a simple graphic that will hook people and add your website's link within that graphic and the first comment. People on Facebook generally have low attention spans, so if you don't really grab their attention in the first few seconds they see your post, they're gone. </p>
<p>The point of this sub-section is to tell you to <em>learn</em> the platform before mindlessly spamming your links. </p>

<p>My #1 lesson learned from my side projects which you can read all about <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.moeminmamdouh.com/how-i-failed-2-side-projects-in-under-a-year-and-lessons-learned">here</a>. What do I mean by long-term strategies? SEO. </p>
<p>SEO is a waiting game. You post your content, and you wait to rank on Google, but you don't just go posting about <em>anything</em>, you need to be smart about what you're writing about.</p>
<h3 id="pick-high-volume-low-competition-keywords">Pick high volume, low competition keywords.</h3>
<p>For example, my last article <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.moeminmamdouh.com/20-free-design-resources-for-developers">20+ Free Design Resources for Developers</a> targeted the keywords 'free design resources'. According to Google Keywords, it receives 1k-10k search queries per month and has low competition, and well, it was a great pick. I'm currently the 10th result on Google for that keyword.</p>
<h3 id="write-valuable-posts">Write valuable posts</h3>
<p>If you provide value, you will get noticed. I went ahead and posted my free design resources article on IndieHackers, <a href="http://dev.to/" target="_blank">dev.to</a>, and HN just for the fun of it. I get around ~250 visitors from posting on there. Great, I head to bed, wake up and check my notifications only to find this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604472876194/lKGEdkJFO.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 1.png"></p>
<p>So what's so surprising? Well, the traffic sources. I only posted on 3 websites. But I open up the acquisition tab and to my surprise, my 2nd most traffic source is from a website that featured my article that I didn't even know about.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604473073706/DsH_DxO5S.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 4.png"></p>
<p><strong>174 visitors came from traffic sources I did not submit my article to.</strong> The article was picked because it received attention on the 3 websites I posted to. Here are the stats for the article on IndieHackers and <a href="http://dev.to/" target="_blank">dev.to</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604473233181/1Q82l3LSp.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 1.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604473303797/YWjWoKvz2.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 2.png"></p>
<p>So I post the article hoping for some short term traffic, but what I didn't know is that it brought longer short term traffic. But wait, wasn't this a short term strategy? Yes, but also no.</p>
<p>You're also building backlinks this way. When a high domain authory website such as daily.dev features your website and links back to your website, that is <strong>great</strong> news.</p>
<h3 id="setup-search-console-and-keep-track-of-your-organic-traffic">Setup Search Console and Keep Track Of Your Organic Traffic</h3>
<p>Search Console takes longer times to crawl new websites so you may find the results to be a little off at the beginning, that's fine. Set it up anyway, it's a very helpful tool. You get to see what keywords you're gaining impressions for, how many clicks you're getting, and what keywords are getting those clicks.</p>
<p>SEO is a long and tiring game, but once you start seeing results it's a great feeling. You no longer have to worry about constantly trying to find sources of traffic, they just roll in. Let me know <strong>your</strong> traffic game in the comments below and I hope you enjoyed this article!</p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<h2><span id="Perfect_brain">Perfect brain</span></h2>
<p>The brain is a perfect design for an intelligent machine. That design can be extended to form a perfect society and to accelerate the progress towards super-intelligence, singularity, and perhaps even <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intrinsically_valuable_state" title="Intrinsically valuable state">intrinsically valuable state</a>. Even though I believe that my vision of the future is optimistic and good, there is no need to bicker about its value. It seems it is just an inevitable course of things emerging as the law of intelligence. 
</p><p>My utopian words can probably be given a precise mathematical framework backed up by a proof. In the end, it might be true that the entire science of physics centers around the competitive forces of intelligence and entropy.
</p>
<h2><span id="Concept_network">Concept network</span></h2>
<p>A concept network is an improvement over the basic idea of artificial neural networks. It has the properties that are often overlooked by neural network researchers:
</p>
<ul><li> the network can grow dendrites in search of new patterns</li>
<li> the network can grow axons while seeking better dissemination of valuable information</li>
<li> the network can grow new neurons along learning demands around often used concepts</li>
<li> the network can delete neurons that are in disuse</li>
<li> network memories exhibit properties known from the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_component_model_of_memory" title="Two component model of memory">two component model of memory</a></li>
<li> network memories are subject to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spacing_effect" title="Spacing effect">spacing effect</a> that determines <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stabilization" title="Stabilization">stabilization</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mechanism_of_the_spacing_effect" title="Mechanism of the spacing effect">Mechanism of the spacing effect</a>)</li>
<li> network self-organizes in the process of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conceptualization" title="Conceptualization">conceptualization</a>, i.e. architectural changes that lead to the development of an effective network of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept" title="Concept">concepts</a></li></ul>
<p>Behavior of a network of concepts cannot realistically be predicted by the behavior of individual concepts. Individual concepts usually do not have access to information about the performance of the entire network.
</p>
<h2><span id="Society">Society</span></h2>
<p>In a society structured around the idea of a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_network" title="Concept network">concept network</a>, a new layer of conceptual organization can be formed in which humans, computers, intelligent agents, databases, executive agents, organizations, corporations, etc. can form an equivalent of advanced concepts. Such a network would provide a seamless co-existence of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> and human <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a> in a structure exhibiting super-intelligence that would quickly progress towards singularity. Mankind has already formed a de facto super-intelligent network. Its problem solving capacity will keep growing exponentially.
</p><p>Currently, societies are organized in ways that lead to a wasteful competition for resources and a conflict of interest. Instead, we could take inspiration from the brain and satisfy core ideas of main political philosophies. If we took all human resources and put them into a form of circulation system, we could drew upon those resources in proportion to the needs, and we might satisfy an old communist maxim: "to everyone according to his needs". A Nobel Prize winner could feed on the resources in proportion to inspiration generated by his brain for humanity. An anarchist or a libertarian would be happy with individual freedoms of individual neurons and concepts. Nobody tells an individual neuron what to do. Neuronal autonomy is perfect. A capitalist who loves market economy would love the efficiency of the neural market of ideas. A socialist would like the fact that even the weakest neurons could find their optimum roles and the access to the bloodstream of resources. There is even some room for religions. Super-intelligence would inevitably drive towards the concept of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intrinsically_valuable_state" title="Intrinsically valuable state">intrinsically valuable state</a>. Some of the religious dogma would probably need a degree of adaptation to the new reality, but I see intelligence as a source of existential answers that would fill the inevitable void.
</p>
<h2><span id="Technology">Technology</span></h2>
<p>There is no need for a revolution or a major re-design. As much as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> simple protocols could start the web, we might develop protocols for societal concept network. One of the first steps would be to provide protocols for redistribution of resources. Strong concepts in the network should never need to waste time on a struggle for resources. I advocate for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Basic_income" title="Basic income">basic income</a>, which is a stopgap measure. However, blockchain micropayments are the future. An inventor cannot waste time seeking patents, angel investors, business partners, or sponsors. Too much young talent is wasted on a job search, in which a great brain lands in a secondary tier of somebody's else's sub-par effort. A good brain should be able to thrive in a concept network from the get-go without wasting a blink on existential issues.
</p>
<h2><span id="All_has_been">All has been</span></h2>
<p>The above text is just a compilation of old ideas of greater minds such as Ted Nelson, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, Jeff Hawkins and many others. There are dozens of minor efforts and models that all slowly drive in that direction (did you hear of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system">CASs</a>?, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">DAOs</a>? or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation">Teal organizations</a>?). Most of all, a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_network" title="Concept network">concept network</a> is a self-organizing intelligent structure. So is humanity. Things are in progress already. However, it helps to see the progression using a convenient model. The brain seems like a good metaphor.

    <p>👉 <em>Looking for actionables and screenshots? Scroll to the bottom of this post.</em></p>

<p>I opened my smartphone’s “screen time” app for the first time recently and was somewhat troubled to discover that on a particular day a few weeks ago:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I unlocked my phone 64 times;</li>
  <li>I used my phone for over 3 hours;</li>
  <li>I received 145 different notifications (!).</li>
</ul>

<p>My first thoughts upon seeing these numbers: how much of this time could I consider as “time well spent”? How much of it could I redirect towards healthier activities?</p>

<hr>

<p>Let’s open up an imaginary toolbox for a moment. Imagine a screwdriver.</p>

<p>A screwdriver is a tool in its purest form. It does not ask for anything, does not require maintenance, and doesn’t distract from the task at hand. It just sits there, patiently waiting to be picked up when needed.</p>

<p><strong>A tool does its job, then gets out of the way</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the kind of relationship I want with my smartphone. It should be tool, and nothing else. With that in mind, I set out to turn my smartphone into a tool again. This <a href="https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/tech-is-not-an-end-part-1">“tool, not distraction” mentality is useful for all kinds of modern technology</a>, not just smartphones. Cal Newport’s “Digital Minimalism” covers this idea pretty well too (<a href="https://maximevaillancourt.com/bookshelf/digital-minimalism-cal-newport">view my reading notes</a>).</p>

<hr>

<p>Picking up my smartphone happens in one of two mental modes: mindfully, or mindlessly. There are no other possible modes of operation when picking up a smartphone.</p>

<p>Mindful use is the best case scenario. Ideally, every single time I’d pick up my smartphone, it would be to resolve a problem, and I’d put it down the second I’d be done. That’s entirely reasonable, though it’s not always what happens. What’s more, it’s not very realistic.</p>

<p>Let’s focus on improving the “mindless” part: I noticed that when I mindlessly pick up my phone, it’s either because a notification came in, or because I’m bored. Knowing this, I now have a few points of leverage I can use:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I can reduce the number of incoming notifications</strong> (reducing the total number of potential unlocks I attempt on the device);</li>
  <li><strong>I can make it more difficult to mindlessly unlock the device</strong> (leading me to really consider if I want to use it);</li>
  <li><strong>I can make sure I spend quality time on the device</strong> once it’s unlocked (encouraging me to do something better than falling prey to distracting apps).</li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce incoming notifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Disable notifications for most everything</strong>. I have notifications enabled for PagerDuty, phone calls, and video calls. Nothing else, not even instant messaging or email. If it’s important, I’ll go look for it myself.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete social media apps and mindfully using them on the laptop/desktop instead</strong>. I used to scroll through Twitter every day on my smartphone before. I now use it a few times a week on my laptop.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce the number of mindless unlocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hide notifications entirely from the lock screen</strong>. This is good from a privacy standpoint and a mindfulness standpoint, as it limits the information exposed to strangers while preventing your curiosity from taking over.</li>
  <li><strong>Disable biometric authentication</strong> such as face and/or fingerprint unlock and instead <strong>use a strong passphrase</strong>. It’s much less convenient, so it acts as a mindfulness check.</li>
</ul>

<p>To spend quality time on the device once it’s unlocked:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Showcase useful apps on your home screen</strong>. For example, Duolingo, podcasts, Instapaper, Anki, Calendar, etc. You get the picture: not Facebook and Twitter.</li>
  <li><strong>Hide time-wasting apps</strong> from the home screen. Even better, delete them altogether! A first great step sis hiding them away in a folder of some sort.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable grayscale display mode</strong> to reduce the enticing effect of the apps icons’ bright colours.</li>
  <li><strong>Use an alternative launcher</strong> like <a href="https://jkuester.github.io/unlauncher/">Unlauncher</a>. You may even customize your launcher if you’re familiar with Java or Kotlin.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, the goal is to make it easier to use the device in a thoughtful, productive fashion than it is to use it for distracting purposes.</p>

<p>After these changes, screen time data for this week shows that on average I unlocked my device 11 times per day (~6x less than before), received 52 notifications per day (~3x less than before), and spent 70 minutes on the device per day (~3x less than before).  ✨</p>

<![CDATA[Clean Code – Notes]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[
Score 30 | Comments 5 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24986604">thread link</a>) | @wheresvic3
<br/>
November 3, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/09/16/clean-code-notes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/09/16/clean-code-notes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  The following is a list of notes taken on writing clean code, i.e. code that is maintainable and extensible.
</p>
<h5 id="names">Names</h5>
<p>
  Naming is the <i>hardest</i> and the most important part of writing clean code. Names should clearly express intent
  and the assumption here is that everyone involved in the codebase has the same cultural background which is not
  always the case in practice. Some general tips:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Classes should be Nouns, e.g. <code>User</code></li>
    <li>Methods should be verbs, e.g. <code>getById()</code>, <code>save()</code></li>
    <li>No need for prefixes such as <code>m_</code> or <code>str</code> for strongly typed languages</li>
    <li>Pick one word per concept, e.g. <code>fetch</code>, <code>retrieve</code> and <code>get</code> are
      semantically equal</li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="functions">Functions</h5>
<p>
  Functions or methods are the fundamental building blocks of programming. In fact, the internal operation of
  programs normally consists mostly of functions pushing data onto and popping data off the stack as they call each
  other. Sometimes memory needs to be allocated on the heap for data that must survive across function calls.
</p>
<p>
  When a function is called, a <strong>stack frame</strong> is created to support the function's execution. The stack
  frame contains the function's local variables and the arguments passed to the function by its caller. The frame
  also contains housekeeping information that allows the called function (the callee) to return to the caller safely.
  The exact contents and layout of the stack vary by processor architecture and function call convention.
</p>
<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/call-stack-layout.svg">
      <img alt="An example of a call stack for the DrawLine function which is called by DrawSquare" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/call-stack-layout.svg">
    </a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An example of a call stack for the <code>DrawLine</code> function which is called by <code>DrawSquare</code>.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Some general tips on writing functions:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Functions should be small and they should do 1 thing only:
      <ul>
        <li>Only have 1 level of indentation - highly nested functions should be refactored into sub-routines</li>
        <li>
          <strong>No side-effects!</strong>
          <pre>public int sum(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b;
    resetGui(); // this is untestable and introduces a hidden dependency!
    return result;
}
</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Do not return <code>null</code> - caller will need to always check cluttering p code, consider using <i>special
        case</i> return values</li>
    <li>Don't pass <code>null</code> as a parameter value either</li>
    <li>Prefer exceptions for error conditions except in cases were a <code>Nullable</code> or <code>Optional</code>
      type is available</li>
    <li>Should ideally return a value, especially for monadic functions as this allows function chaining</li>
    <li>Fewer arguments are better - the more the arguments, the more the complexity and test cases that need to be
      written</li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="oop">Object Oriented Programming</h5>
<p>
  An important but suble point to note in OOP is that objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose
  functions that operate on that data whereas data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions.
  Good OOP requires knowing when to use objects and when to use data structures. Consider the following example:
  </p><pre>public class Point {
    public double x;
    public double y;
}

public interface Point {
    double getX();
    double getY();
    void setCartesian(double x, double y);
    double getR();
    double getTheta();
    void setPolar(double r, double theta);
}
</pre>
    <p>
      In the second <code>Point</code> definition the co-ordinate system being used by the implementation is not
      known and need not necessarily be cartesian nor polar!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tips on writing clean OO code:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Classes should be small and follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>
        <li>Classes should have high cohesion, i.e. operate on a small number of variables</li>
        <li>Avoid using boundary interfaces, e.g. instead of returning a <code>Map</code>, wrap it in a class (<code>Sensors</code>)
          to encapsulate the implementation</li>
        <li>Comments should only be used for clarification or amplification - avoid in general and let the code
          do the talking!</li>
        <li>Prefer exceptions to error codes - error codes have the habit of spilling out into the entire
          system</li>
        <li>Use unchecked exceptions to not break encapsulation</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>
      Finally, procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change. OO
      code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change. Again, writing clean code
      requires insight as to when to use which style of programming.
    </p>
    <h5 id="tdd">Test Driven Development</h5>
    <p>
      Unit Tests should follow the F.I.R.S.T principle, i.e. they should be Fast, Independent of any external
      dependencies or manual setup, Repeatable, Self-validating (no manual checking verification) and Timely (run
      just before writing production code). Some general tips on writing clean tests:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Tests should be readable above all else and this might mean relaxing certain production code
          restrictions on performance</li>
        <li>Single concept per test</li>
        <li>Create helper methods to simplify complicated setups</li>
        <li>Convert multiple asserts into a single assert via a state pattern</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      The three laws of TDD:
      </p><dl>

    <h5 id="system-design">System Design</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Classes should follow the open-closed principle - open for extension but closed for modification.
          Consider the following example where we write an <code>AreaCalculator</code> which calculates the
          total area of a collection of rectangles.
          <pre>public class Rectangle {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<rectangle> rectangles) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Rectangle r : rectangles) {
            result += r.width * r.height;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</rectangle></pre> We would now like to extend this function to calculate the area of circles as well. Our new function now looks
          as follows:
          <pre>public abstract class Shape { }

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<shape> shapes) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            if (s instanceof Rectangle) {
                Rectangle r = (Rectangle) s;
                result += r.width * r.height;
            } else {
                Circle c = (Circle) s;
                result += c.radius * c.radius * Math.PI;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</shape></pre> Extending this further to calculate the area of triangles now requires another modification to the <code>calculateArea</code>
          method, i.e. it is not <strong>open for extension</strong>. We can change this by introducing an
          <code>area</code> method on the <code>Shape</code> data structure. Our code now looks like the
          following:
          <pre>public abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area();
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return radius * radius * Math.PI;
    }
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<shape> shapes) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            result += s.area(); // note the simplicity
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</shape></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Dependency Inversion Principle - depend upon abstractions and interfaces, not concrete
          implementations</li>
        <li>When building large software systems, try to avoid doing a big design up front - use a dependency
          injection container to separate cross-cutting concers like transactions, logging, etc. from
          business logic</li>

        <div><p>Clean energy from fusion is a step closer with the launch of the MAST Upgrade tokamak.</p>

<p>For the first time, after a seven-year build, UKAEA’s £55M-machine, labelled <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/mast-upgrade/">Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) Upgrade</a>, has achieved “first plasma” – where all the essential components work together simultaneously.</p>
<p>The project at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy was funded by the Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences Research Council, part of UK Research &amp; Innovation and the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy.</p>
<p>Fusion energy offers the potential of an abundant, inherently safe low-carbon electricity supply (the raw materials are found in seawater and the Earth’s crust). It involves fusing hydrogen particles in a hot gas known as a ‘plasma’ to unlock large amounts of energy.</p>
<p>Operating fusion technologies requires a careful balancing act of controlling extreme heat, gas and powerful magnetic fields, amongst other complex systems.</p>
<h3>Super-X factor</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in fusion research has been to extract the amount of excess heat from the plasma. UKAEA’s scientists now plan to test a new exhaust system called the ‘Super-X divertor’ at MAST Upgrade.</p>
<p>This system is designed to channel plasma out of the machine at temperatures low enough for its materials to withstand – meaning that components can last much longer. The approximate tenfold reduction in heat arriving at the internal surfaces of the machine has the potential to be a game-changer for the long-term viability of future fusion power stations.</p>
<h3>A step towards fusion power</h3>
<p>MAST Upgrade will be the forerunner of the UK’s prototype fusion power plant, <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/step/">Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (“STEP”)</a>, due for completion by 2040.</p>
<p>STEP – which UKAEA is designing in an initial £220 million programme funded by the UK Government – will be based on MAST Upgrade’s ‘spherical tokamak’ fusion concept. The spherical tokamak could offer a route to a compact fusion power plant. The success of MAST Upgrade is another step along the way to designing future fusion power facilities, which could have an important role as part of a future portfolio of low-carbon energy.</p>
<p>MAST Upgrade will also aid preparations for <a href="https://www.iter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITER</a> – the world’s largest science megaproject, now being built in the South of France, which intends to demonstrate fusion power on an industrial scale.</p>

<p>UK Science Minister, Amanda Solloway, said: “We want the UK to be a world leader in fusion energy and to capitalise on its amazing potential as a clean energy source that could last for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>“Backed by £55 million of government funding, powering up the MAST Upgrade device is a landmark moment for this national fusion experiment and takes us another step closer towards our goal of building the UK’s first fusion power plant by 2040.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the achievement of first plasma, UKAEA CEO, Professor Ian Chapman, said:</p>
<p>“MAST Upgrade will take us closer to delivering sustainable, clean fusion energy. This experiment will break new ground and test technology that has never been tried before. It ensures the UK is in the premier league of countries working on fusion – and will be vital in achieving UKAEA’s goal of building the STEP fusion power plant.”</p>

<![CDATA[Serendipity in a Remote World]]>

November 3, 2020 | http://akhilkg.me/blog/serendipity | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://akhilkg.me/blog/serendipity">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong></p>
<p> noun <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>”a fortunate stroke of serendipity"</em></p></div>
<p>I hadn't even heard of the word ‘serendipity’ before COVID and true to its nature - serendipity is events happening organically - by chance or "spontaneously".</p>
<p>In real life, we almost always fail to notice serendipity to put a word on it. I only came across the word when everything went remote and random interactions came to a full stop and now suddenly, something was missing. <br>
Obviously, it was other people.
But even with video calls, meetings, standups - it didn't feel right. </p>
<p>The truth is nothing can beat a real-life conversation with someone - not chat, audio or video. Maybe not even VR or holograms.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/97962688-b401eb00-1ddb-11eb-9903-2c485567e6e6.gif" alt="Silicon Valley GIF"></p><p><em>(Silicon Valley, S1E5)</em></p>
<hr>

<p>Random interactions in a fully remote world have to be forced. That’s just how we must play it now. But trying to duplicate in-person serendipity in a remote world - as is - might not be a great way out.</p>
<p>For instance, take the Qt World Summit this year which happened about a week ago:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/97961622-ab101a00-1dd9-11eb-88b4-ab044cf9da5e.png" alt="qtws"></p><p><em>Reminds me of Club Penguin. Heh</em></p>
<p>I don’t know about you but to me, that looks extraordinarily distracting and borderline unnecessary. </p>
<p>Creating organic serendipity in a totally remote set up is a tough nut to crack - props to Qt for trying something new but to pretend that ‘online’ is the new ‘offline’ might not be the way to solve it. </p>
<p>On the same note though, multiplayer games are quite effective in the right context - simple, popular ones like <a href="http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php">'Among Us'</a> can work both as an icebreaker and as a way to create organic interactions between a group of people and games have always been a source of a spontaneous group activity.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>Embracing remote</h3>
<p><strong>The case of GitLab</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> is an all remote company - right from the beginning as an open-source project - GitLab, in its initial days, was developed from contributors around the world. The GitLab team is now over 1,200 employees strong and Gitlab recently held its Series E round with $268M raised - and all of this without even having a physical office.</p>
<p>GitLab has an <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/">excellent handbook</a> on remote work, some key points - </p>
<h4>Regular engagement</h4>
<p>To simulate serendipity within a team - engage regularly on a weekly basis - in form of text or video. </p>
<p>Nothing beats seeing someone in person and the closest we can get to in-person meetings are video calls. Try to have regular video calls with your team - it might require some getting used to - to discuss something other than work but once you establish a flow, video calls are super effective.</p>
<p>Even an always-on video conferencing room or dedicated time slots for video/audio chat can also work wonders.</p>
<br>
<h4>Async</h4>
<p>Regarding work - asynchronous is preferred over synchronous communication.</p>
<p>Meetings are synchronous events - they require everyone at the same time.
Asynchronous events are things like chat/etc that do not require an immediate response.</p>
<p>An all remote culture means employees from all different timezones and so - meetings are only kept for the most important things and are also most of the times, optional. </p>
<p>Record the meetings, have an agenda, maintain the minutes, allow people to asynchronously contribute and don’t waste time.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/97961918-27a2f880-1dda-11eb-9a8d-8871b55cb778.png" alt="this meeting should have been an email"></p><h4>Role of text communication</h4>
<p>Most of remote communication happens through text and texting can get quite difficult at times - mainly because of the lack of non-verbals (like the lack of your facial expressions and tone when you are trying to tell a joke in chat but no one gets it)</p>
<p>"<em>Text communication can be easily derailed, and assumptions can lead to  good-mannered communiques being viewed as a slight.</em>"</p>
<p>Assume the best - don’t be an asshole.
From experience, when things start getting heated up on a text chat, jump immediately to a video call and straighten things up. Don’t keep it for later. </p>
<p>It’s really, really easy to get angry with someone’s stupid texts but when you see their face or hear their voice, that anger starts to dissipate ;)</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p>All in all, remote is tough and we need to intentionally create situations and design systems where we can interact organically and spontaneously.</p></div></div>]]>

</figure>


<p><strong>Advertising VOD, Subscription VOD, Transactional VOD, Premium VOD are different monetization models in the Video On Demand (VOD) ecosystem and represent different ways of engaging and monetizing users on the platform. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the use cases for all four in this article and help you decide the best monetization modelf for your business. </p>




<h2><span id="What_is_Video_On_Demand_(VOD)"></span>What is Video On Demand (VOD)?<span></span></h2>



<p>When I asked people in the streaming industry, what Video On Demand or VOD meant to them, this is what I got (averaging across responses). </p>



<p><em>Video On Demand is a video delivery mechanism that allows users to watch a video whenever they want to and wherever they want to.</em></p>



<p>Of course, this statement comes with caveats. VOD access can be restricted based on age, geography, monetization strategy, device, and so many other means. </p>



<p>In this article, we take a look at some of the common ways by which content providers can monetize their VOD content library. We also take a look at the advantages and pitfalls of each of these methods. </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="AVOD_%E2%80%93_AdvertisingBased_Video_On_Demand"></span>AVOD – Advertising-Based Video On Demand?<span></span></h2>



<p>AVOD or Advertising-Based Video On Demand is a monetization strategy in which advertisements are inserted into the video to monetize it and (in almost all cases), the content can be consumed for free without paying or subscribing to the service. </p>



<h3><span id="Where_does_AVOD_Work"></span>Where does AVOD Work?<span></span></h3>



<p>AVOD is a monetization technique that is predicated on a large number of people consuming the content in order to make it financially viable. The publisher typically gets paid a couple of dollars (or more) for every 1000 ad impressions and this means, that a lot of people need to watch the video for the publisher to make a resonable amount of money. </p>



<p>AVOD is typically suited for news websites, and UGC sites such as YouTube, Hulu,  where the primary source of income is from advertising driven by large audiences. AVOD a <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/streamers-flock-to-avod-gold-rush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very popular form of video monetization</a> and ad insertion is not going to go away anytime soon! </p>



<h3><span id="How_Can_AVOD_Go_Wrong"></span>How Can AVOD Go Wrong?<span></span></h3>



<p>Well, that’s not hard to answer! Have you ever watched a video on YouTube with 40 ads inserted into it? Remember the frustration you felt waiting for the “Skip Ads” button to appear?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/memegenerator.net/img/images/12523690.jpg?resize=435%2C245&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="Extremely Frustrated - Caption | Meme Generator" width="435" height="245" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/memegenerator.net/img/images/12523690.jpg?resize=435%2C245&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>SKIP ADS!!!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Well, “<strong>user frustration</strong>” is a huge problem with AVOD. </p>



<p>Too many ads can <strong>literally kill the golden goose (your audience)</strong>. But, too few ads and you won’t make any money to pay your bills at the end of the month. </p>



<p>So, it’s a balancing act between making money, not frustrating your users, and showing the correct number of relevant ads. What’s the correct number of ads? Well, you need a specialized analytics service to track and report on this. </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="SVOD_%E2%80%93_Subscription_Video_On_Demand"></span>SVOD – Subscription Video On Demand<span></span></h2>



<p>SVOD is a type of VOD monetization where users are required to pay a certain amount of money or subscription fee upfront to get access to the content providers’ library. This is usually a recurring fee and is usually either monthly or yearly. </p>



<p>Typically, the users are not shown any ads because they have paid a certain fee already (<em>which means, the publisher has already made money off of the user</em>). </p>



<p>SVOD is a very common monetization strategy that is quite beneficial to the end-user when the plan doesn’t have any lock-in periods. People may choose to purchase a monthly plan and cancel the following month. </p>



<p>As you can see, this sort of flexibility is a double-edged sword. It </p>



<p>Netflix, Hotstar, Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime Video are all examples of SVOD. </p>



<h3><span id="How_can_SVOD_go_Wrong"></span>How can SVOD go Wrong?<span></span></h3>



<p>SVOD can go wrong in many ways and the primary way is by setting a very high subscription fee, but, not having a large enough or relevant content library to back it up. If you charge your users $15 a month when your nearest competitor is charging $7/month, then you need to justify the $8 gap. </p>



<p>Do you have better movies? Latest releases? A bigger library? More genres? Better quality of experience? </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="TVOD_%E2%80%93_TransactionBased_Video_On_Demand"></span>TVOD – Transaction-Based Video On Demand<span></span></h2>



<p><strong>TVOD</strong> or <strong>Transactional Video On Demand</strong> basically refers to a rental based monetization where the user rents or has access to the service for a short period of time by paying a fee. </p>



<p><strong>This is also referred to as “pay per view”. </strong></p>



<p>A simple example is that of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) or Boxing matches. You can pay to see a fight online and then your access to the service is complete. If you want to access or use any other content, you’ll have to pay another fee. </p>



<p>Apart from one-off events, TVOD also refers to rental services offered by content providers such as YouTube and Amazon Prime Video. In either of these services, you can rent a movie for a couple of days and then your access to the content is stopped. </p>



<h3><span id="What_can_go_wrong_with_TVOD"></span>What can go wrong with TVOD?<span></span></h3>



<p>In TVOD, if one does not get the price right, then the number of live viewers will be less and people might prefer to watch it for free later on using catch-up services. The same goes for video rentals – people might choose to rent it from a different provider at a lower cost.</p>



<p>Also, since the customer is not “locked-in”, there needs to be sustained marketing and promotions to ensure that the customer makes repeat purchases. It is a tough monetization choice, but one that can provide handsome returns! </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="PVOD_%E2%80%93_Premium_Video_On_Demand"></span>PVOD – Premium Video On Demand<span></span></h2>



<p>Premium Video on Demand is a form of TVOD or SVOD where the end-user can pay to get access to content sooner than other SVOD or TVOD customers would! Think of PVOD as a form of online-movie-theaters. You can go see the latest movie at the theaters or wait three or four months to see them on an SVOD service, right? </p>



<p>Well, that’s exactly the monetization model for PVOD. You can pay a “premium” price to watch a movie before it hits the general SVOD subscriber pool. </p>



<p>Disney’s Mulan is a good example of PVOD. You needed a subscription to Disney+ and then you had to pay an additional $25 (or so) to watch Mulan first-day-first-show! But, you retained access to the movie until it because available to the rest of the Disney+ subscribers. </p>



<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing cinemas shut, I feel we are going to see more of PVOD in the coming months! </p>

<h2><span id="Hybrid_Revenue/Monetization_Models"></span>Hybrid Revenue/Monetization Models<span></span></h2>



<p>Just to be clear, VOD monetization does not stop at AVOD, SVOD, TVOD, and PVOD. </p>



<p><strong>In fact, many popular services offer a combination of the above monetization models to appeal to different segments of users.</strong> </p>



<p>There are hybrid models such as the “<strong>Freemium Model</strong>” that merges AVOD and SVOD. In the freemium model, a user can consume content for free but will have to contend with the occasional advertisement interrupting his video session. </p>



<p>But, if that user chooses to upgrade to a paid subscription, the ads go away! </p>



<p>Another variation of the freemium model is providing a small section of your content library for free and charging a subscription fee to watch the more premium content.  </p>



<p>Freemium is a popular tactic that is used to attract users with free content, get them hooked, and hopefully convert them into paid customers. </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>There you have it – different monetization models for VOD (AVOD, SVOD, TVOD, PVOD, and other Hybrid Models). All of these have their own advantages and disadvantages. The idea is to get your strategy, marketing, and focus right. And then, everything will fall into place.</p>



<p>So, what do you use to monetize your content library? </p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>After a decade of honing my skills as a mini-golfer, I’ve recently progressed onto playing a new version of golf: <a href="https://www.vimgolf.com/">VimGolf</a>. I’ve been using <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> for a few years now, and noticed that my Vim skillset had plateaued. The premise of VimGolf is simple: challenges consist of a start file and an end file. The goal is to get from the start file to the end file, using Vim, in as few keystrokes as possible. I’ve been playing VimGolf as a way to acquire new skills.</p>

<p>I’ve learned all kinds of new keystrokes and Vim tips through playing. Predictably, some of them are very niche and forgettable. But, I’ve found others which I didn’t know and now incorporate daily into my Vim usage. I’d imagine reading this, some will be familiar, and some new. This is <em>not</em> meant to be an introduction to Vim. Rather if (like me) you’ve been using Vim for a little bit but haven’t recently looked up Vim commands, I’m hoping some of these will be helpful.</p>

<p>My recommendation in reading through this post is to have a file open in Vim, and try out these commands as you read them. I hope at least a few are helpful for your workflow and make their way into your regular Vim usage!</p>

<h3 id="insertion">Insertion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>Ctrl-n</code> in insertion mode inserts based on context. It will prompt a word based on contents of the file. Keep hitting <code>Ctrl-n</code> to get the contextually next word</li>
  <li><code>O</code> moves into insertion mode in a new line above the cursor</li>
  <li><code>ci&lt;char&gt;</code> to delete within the <code>&lt;char&gt;</code> and put you in insertion mode. For example, <code>ci(</code> deletes everything within the <code>(...)</code> and puts you in insertion mode. Also helpful, <code>ci”</code> and <code>ci{</code></li>
  <li><code>S</code> deletes the current line and puts you in insertion mode</li>
  <li><code>.</code> repeats the previous action (specifically helpful for insertion)</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-o</code> in insertion mode escapes for one command in normal mode. This is <em>very</em> helpful for movement while inserting</li>
  <li><code>I</code> inserts at the beginning of the line</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>^</code> moves the cursor to the first non-whitespace character on the line</li>
  <li><code>+</code> moves to the beginning of the first word (non-whitespace character) on next line</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-o</code> (backwards) and <code>Ctrl-i</code> (forwards) together jump the cursor around to where it was previously in any files. Keep using <code>Ctrl-o</code> to go backwards, and <code>Ctrl-i</code> to go forwards. (<code>:help jumplist</code> for more info here)</li>
  <li><code>B</code> (backwards) and <code>E</code> (forwards) move the cursor using only whitespace as delimiters</li>
  <li><code>F&lt;char&gt;</code> (backwards) and <code>f&lt;char&gt;</code> (forwards) find a character or word on the current line</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="copy-paste">Copy Paste</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>Y</code> highlights the line and copies it (I had been using <code>Vy</code> for this)</li>
  <li><code>"+y</code> copies highlighted words to the clipboard so you can paste the value outside of Vim</li>
  <li><code>"+Y</code> copies the line the cursor is on to the clipboard so you can paste the value outside of Vim</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-y</code> in insertion mode pastes the contents of the line directly above</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: If you highlight a word (or lines) and then replace it, the highlighted word moves into the register, and will be the next word you paste</p>

<h3 id="indenting-text">Indenting Text</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> (left) and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> (right) shifts the current line</li>
  <li><code>&lt;iB</code> (left) and <code>&gt;iB</code> (right) shifts the code in the current block</li>
  <li><code>=i{</code> fixes indentation of block excluding the braces</li>
  <li><code>=a{</code> fixes indentation of block including the braces</li>
  <li><code>gg=G</code> to indent the full file</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: Use <code>gg=G</code> and then <code>Ctrl-o</code> to get the cursor back to where it was</p>

<h4 id="refocusing-the-page">Refocusing the page</h4>
<ul>
  <li><code>zt</code> moves the line the cursor is on to the top of the page</li>
  <li><code>zz</code> moves the line the cursor is on to the middle of the page</li>
  <li><code>zb</code> moves the line the cursor is on to the bottom of the page</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specific-characters">Specific Characters</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>~</code> switches the case of a character</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-a</code> increments numbers</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-x</code> decrements numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: The cursor doesn’t need to be on the number itself, it’ll increment or decrement any number after the cursor on the same line</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>ZZ</code> and <code>:x</code> both only save the file if it has been modified, and then quit</li>
  <li><code>:!&lt;command&gt;</code> to run a bash command from Vim (for example <code>:!ls</code>)</li>
  <li><code>gql</code> will split one line to the currently set width. To set the width of the split lines to be different from your current setting, you can use <code>:set textwidth=&lt;n&gt;</code>. This can be helpful for 80 character linting, for example</li>
  <li><code>dat</code> deletes everything inside an HTML tag including the tag</li>
  <li><code>dit</code> deletes everything inside an HTML tag excluding the tag</li>
</ul>

Grab a coffee or tea or even an alcoholic beverage and let me take you into the <em>Twilight Zone</em> of the audiobook business, where the company who now controls a majority of the publishing industry, the same company who calls themselves the most customer-centric company in the world is fleecing authors blind, emphasis on blind (since they've been hiding it very well for years.)

Your favorite authors, me included, have been used in a program by Amazon called <strong>Audible.</strong> You might have heard of them. They're just a little audiobook company that it seems  may be losing market share, or something has worried them, so they've found a way around the one thing standing between them and mega-profits: </span><strong><span>paying their content providers.</span></strong><span> You know, the little guys who spend months, years even, creating a story, then producing an audiobook to keep their readers happy and hopefully bolster their mostly meagre income in order to feed their family or pay for enough coffee to write their next book.
</span>
</span></p><p id="viewer-704bm"><span><strong><span>Returns have been actively hidden from Rights Holders and we have been robbed in broad daylight (or blank spreadsheet).<!-- --> </span></strong></span></p><p id="viewer-9ndfm"><span><span>Whether you are an author who has audiobooks currently or you are planning audiobooks, or you're a book lover or Audible customer, it's worth your while to read this saga. This is probably the single worst royalties grab by an Amazon company so far, and we need to stand together and stop this urgently. Big and small earning authors and those in-between, along with small publishers (and maybe Big Fives) are losing mega-dollars because of Audible's egregious behavior. Soon book lovers will also lose, because audiobooks will no longer be released from their beloved authors, me being one. It's just not financially worth it, plus who wants their stuff stolen when you've taken so much care to make it so nice.</span></span></p><div id="viewer-5pbpg"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.susanmaywriter.net/single-post/audiblegate-the-incredible-story-of-missing-sales" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a4d16d_43db2e505afd472e98cb4e47cf6699f8~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300%2Ch_225%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a4d16d_43db2e505afd472e98cb4e47cf6699f8~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-ahpnm"><span><span>Audible has their own publishing/distribution company where you can produce your book and then that book is distributed to Audible, Amazon and Apple. If you choose  to <em>"go exclusive" </em>and distribute only to these three, you are granted the princely profit split of 40%. This is after spending sometimes upward of $6 to $8k on an audiobook. To give you an idea, my last audiobook </span><a href="http://readerlinks.com/l/779139/ddz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Destination Dark Zone</span></u></a><span> cost me $US6,200 to produce. 

If you're not exclusive to Audible and decide to distribute your book to other retail stores such as Kobo, Scrib'd and local libraries, then you only receive twenty-five percent of your sales or your share of the pot from memberships. 

Oh, that's right I didn't mention that. There's three ways an author is paid. When an Audible member uses a monthly credit that they receive as part of their membership, a rights holder receives a share of the pot created by the number of memberships paid, minus Audible's profit. This pot varies each month. So we never know how much this per download share will be until the day we are paid, but it's something close to $US5, while members pay $14.95 for a membership and one credit per month to use on a book. 

When you pay, say, $7.49 on Amazon for an add-on audiobook when you've purchased the eBook, we are paid $2.99 on the forty percent split. Should you buy an audiobook as a member from Audible and not use a credit, according to my reports, members pay $9.15 for most of my books, and I receive $3.61.  

Some rights holders don't have an exclusive deal with Audible. Many don't because they believe in not putting all their eggs in Amazon's basket. Well, they get less. So, just go right ahead and nearly halve these payments because they only receive twenty-five percent. It's not much is it compared to what readers and members pay for each book or monthly subscription fee?</span></span></p><p id="viewer-7l2n4"><span><span>Here's a crash course. You don't just record it and release like it's magic. You have to search for the perfect narrator and that sure takes some time. Then brief them, swapping emails until you're positive they're a good fit for you and your work. There's plenty of to-ing and fro-ing between you, as you nail the characters' voices and polish them to your liking before the narrator starts the narration. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-8b75k"><span><span>This involves them sending you a fifteen minute file, you listen and send them feedback until you're both happy. There's studios hired sometimes, and the narrator's fee is dependent upon their experience and quality of work. Mine have all won awards and they don't come cheap, but they're brilliant professionals so I don't begrudge their charges. After the recording, which can take a week or more, we have proofing and engineering to ensure the whole book's sound is consistent and intakes of breath and random clicks are banished.

For every hour to which you listen, it takes two to four to produce, and that's just the narrator's time. In my case, I listen through the finished audio files, and even with paying for proofing still a few mistakes slip through. So back it goes for the narrator to drop in the corrections (which takes a bit of time for the narrator, and if it's my mistake with a typo I pay extra) until it's right. You won't believe how tough it is to listen to your own book and think, G<em>ee, I could have written that sentence better, </em>or<em> hear</em> an actual typo or the same word used too many times in one paragraph.

Then, finally, yay, your audiobook is done and you pay the narrator or, in some cases, independent authors who can't afford to pay up front enter a royalty share deal and split the future income with the narrator for seven years. So, in this case, the narrator works for nothing, zip, nada, and hopes to eventually, somewhere down the track, recover their costs and actually get paid so they can buy mouth gargle and honey to keep their voices healthy and, well, eat. It's pretty tough for some if they pick the wrong book to narrate which doesn't sell and never pays out. They've worked for nothing.

The excited author then excitedly hits publish and waits for their book to go through Quality Assurance at ACX. Keep in mind, they've already paid and probably aren't rich, so they need that book out there selling to get their money back because, well, eating is kind of addictive, and life without hot water is pretty miserable. 

For the past twelve months though some authors and narrators have been waiting months to have their books approved. This is while business is booming at Audible apparently but they don't have enough staff to keep everything running smoothly. It's November 2020 now, and I've seen comments that there are some audiobooks from March, and even January, still caught up in the quality assurance system. And these kind of delays started well before COVID hit. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-29dq1"><span><span>I'd like to pause at this moment to ask where the Quality Assurance Department is for their Quality Assurance Department? <strong>"We seem to have a problem here, Captain Kirk."

<section itemprop="articleBody">
<p>This summer I’ve been interning at <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>, and have been writing a lot of Go. It’s been a bit of a change coming from a Haskell background, so I decided to write up my thoughts now, at the end.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<h3 id="incredibly-easy-to-pick-up">Incredibly easy to pick up</h3>
<p>There’s not a lot to Go, it’s quite a small language. I had never written a line of it before June, and now I’ve written about 30,000. It’s very easy to get started and become productive.</p>
<p>Haskell, on the other hand, is notorious for being hard to learn (<em>cough</em> monad tutorials <em>cough</em>). People often find it really hard to take the step from evaluating pure mathematical expressions to writing actual programs. I experienced no such disconnect in Go.</p>
<h3 id="garbage-collector-keeps-getting-better-and-better">Garbage collector keeps getting better and better</h3>
<p>Pusher previously tried to use Haskell for the project I was working on, but eventually had to give up due to unpredictable latency caused by garbage collection pauses. GHC’s garbage collector is <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/latency-working-set-ghc-gc-pick-two/">designed for throughput, not latency</a>. It is a generational copying collector, which means that pause times are proportional to the amount of live data in the heap. To make matters worse, it’s also stop-the-world.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.golang.org/go15gc">Go’s garbage collector</a> is a concurrent mark-sweep with very short stop-the-world pauses, and it just seems to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.7#performance">keep getting better</a>. This is definitely a good thing for a garbage collected language. We did have some issues with unacceptable latencies, but were able to work them all out. No such luck with the Haskell project.</p>
<h3 id="style-wars-are-a-thing-of-the-past">Style wars are a thing of the past</h3>
<p>Say what you like about <code>gofmt</code>, but it makes arguments over code style almost impossible. Just run it on save, and your code will always be consistently formatted.</p>
<p>I do find it a little strange that <code>gofmt</code> has been completely accepted, whereas Python’s significant whitespace (which is there for exactly the same reason: enforcing readable code) has been much more contentious across the programming community.</p>
<h2 id="the-neutral">The Neutral</h2>
<h3 id="code-generation-seems-to-be-the-accepted-solution-to-a-lot-of-problems">Code generation seems to be the accepted solution to a lot of problems</h3>
<p>I am not a huge fan of code generation (and I say this as <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/go-interface-fuzzer/">the author of a code generation tool</a>). I think it can do good, but it can also obscure what’s actually going on. In every discussion on Go generics, someone will come along and say you can add generics with code generation: that’s true, but at the cost of introducing additional, nonstandard, syntax.</p>
<p>I suspect the strong culture of code generation is largely because it lets you work around the flaws of the language.</p>
<h3 id="strict-not-lazy-evaluation">Strict, not lazy, evaluation</h3>
<p>Strict evaluation is typically better for performance than lazy evaluation (thunks cause allocation, so you’re gambling that <a href="https://www.barrucadu.co.uk/posts/2016-02-12-strict-vs-lazy.html">the computation saved offsets the memory cost</a>), but it does make things less composable. There have been a couple of times where I’ve gone to split up a function, only to realise that doing so would require allocating a data structure in memory which before was not needed.</p>
<p>I could trust the compiler to inline things for me, and so optimise away the additional allocations, but in a lazy language you just don’t have that issue at all.</p>
<h3 id="the-standard-library-is-not-so-great">The standard library is not so great</h3>
<p>If you know me in person, it might seem a little odd that I specifically comment on this. Normally I am all for languages having a small, really well-written, stdlib and everything else provided through libraries. I am picking on Go here a bit because the standard library seems to get a lot of praise, but I was unimpressed.</p>
<p>Parts of it are good, a lot of it is mediocre, and some of it is downright bad (like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/">go/ast</a> package documentation). It seems a lot of Go’s use is in webdev, so perhaps those bits of the stdlib (which I haven’t touched at all) are consistently good.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>I also agree with this Quora answer by Tikhon Jelvis to <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-you-feel-that-golang-is-ugly">do you feel that golang is ugly?</a>, so have a look at that once you’ve read this section.</p>
<h3 id="a-culture-of-backwards-compatibility-at-all-costs">A culture of “backwards compatibility at all costs”</h3>
<p>In Go, you import packages by URL. If the URL points to, say, GitHub, then <code>go get</code> downloads HEAD of master and uses that. There is no way to specify a version, unless you have separate URLs for each version of your library.</p>
<p>This is just insane.</p>
<p>Go has a very strong culture of backwards compatibility, which I think is largely due to this. Even if you have a flaw in the API of your library, you can’t actually <em>fix</em> it because that would break all of your reverse-dependencies, unless they do vendoring, or pin to a specific commit.</p>
<p>Coming from the Haskell world, where the attitude is far more towards correctness than compatibility, this was probably the biggest culture shock for me. Things break backwards compatibility in Haskell, and the users just update their code because they <em>know</em> the library author did it for a reason. In Go, it just doesn’t happen <em>at all</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-type-system-is-really-weak">The type system is really weak</h3>
<p>A common mantra in Haskell is “make illegal states unrepresentable,” which is great. If you’ve never come across it before it means to <em>choose your types such that an illegal value is a static error</em>. Want to avoid nulls? Use an option type. Want to ensure a list has at least one element? Use a nonempty list type. Use proper enums, not just ints. etc etc</p>
<p>In Go you just can’t do that, the type system isn’t strong enough. So a lot of things which are (or can be) a <em>compile-time</em> error in Haskell are a <em>runtime</em> error in Go, which is just worse.</p>
<p>Let’s pick on some specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No generics</strong></p>
<p>Want to write a tree where every element is statically <em>guaranteed</em> to be the same type? Well, have fun implementing a “uinttree”, an “inttree”, a “stringtree”, and so on. You can’t just implement a generic tree.</p>
<p>But Go <em>does</em> have generics, for the built-in types. Arrays, channels, maps, and slices all have generic type parameters. So it seems that the Go developers want generics, but they don’t want to bother implementing it properly, so it remains a special case for a few things in the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No sum types</strong></p>
<p>The way in Go to handle possibly-failing functions is to have multiple return values: an actual result, and an error. If the error is <code>nil</code>, then the actual result is sensible; otherwise the actual result is meaningless.</p>
<p>This means you can forget to check the error and use a bogus result and, because there are no compiler warnings (another wtf), you will know nothing of this until things fail at runtime.</p>
<p>With a sum type, like <code>Either error result</code>, that just can’t happen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No separation of pure code from effectful code</strong></p>
<p>It is very nice to know, just by looking at the type of a function, that it <em>cannot</em> perform any side-effects. Go’s type system doesn’t do that.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-tooling-is-bad">The tooling is bad</h3>
<p>Haskell gets a lot of criticism for bad tooling, but I think it’s worlds ahead of Go in some cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Godoc makes it really difficult to write good documentation</strong></p>
<p>Godoc groups bindings by type, and then sorts alphabetically. Code is not written like that, code is written with related functions in proximity to each other. The source order is <em>almost always</em> better than how godoc sorts things.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/7873">godoc doesn’t even support lists</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Previous proposals similar to this have been rejected on grounds that it’s a slippery slope from this to Markdown or worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that comment is particularly discouraging. Because the developers don’t like Markdown (and similar languages), they refuse to add even the most basic of formatting to godoc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is nothing like GHC’s heap profiling</strong></p>
<p>Go has a snapshot-based memory profiler. You can take a snapshot at a point in time, and see which functions and types are taking up the heap space. However, there is <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html#profiling-memory-usage">nothing like this</a>.</p>
<p>Being able to see not only a snapshot, but also how things have changed over time, is incredibly useful for spotting memory leaks. If all you have is a snapshot, all you can really say is “well, the number of allocated <code>Foo</code>s looks a bit high, is that right?” With a graph you can say “the number of allocated <code>Foo</code>s is increasing when it shouldn’t be.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is (was?) nothing like ThreadScope</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/ThreadScope">ThreadScope</a> is a tool for profiling performance of concurrent Haskell programs. It shows which Haskell threads are running on which OS threads, when garbage collection happens, and a bunch of other information.</p>
<p>If things are slower than expected, it’s great: you can see <em>exactly</em> how things are executing. Go doesn’t <em>currently</em> have anything like it, although towards the end of Dave Cheney’s <strong>Seven ways to profile Go applications</strong> talk at <a href="http://golanguk.com/">GolangUK</a>, he did whip out something which looked rather like ThreadScope (sadly, a video isn’t up at the time of writing, that I can see).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-values-are-almost-never-what-you-want">Zero values are almost never what you want</h3>
<p>Go avoids the issue of uninitialised memory by having “zero values”. If you declare a variable of type <code>int</code>, but don’t give it a value, it gets the value 0. Simple.</p>
<p>Except that that’s almost never what you want.</p>
<p>What is a sensible default value for a type? Well, it depends on what you’re using it for! Sometimes there isn’t a sensible default, and not initialising a value should be an error. You can’t define a zero value for your own types, so you’re kind of stuck.</p>
<p>Zero values caused so many problems over the summer, because everything would <em>appear</em> to be fine, then it suddenly breaks because the zero value wasn’t sensible for its context of use. Perhaps it’s an unrelated change that causes things to break (like a struct getting an extra field).</p>
<p>I would much rather:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop the syntax for declaring a variable without giving it a value.</li>
<li>Make it an error to not initialise a struct field.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lots-of-boilerplate">Lots of boilerplate</h3>
<p>The cause of the lots of code generation, I feel.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because you have to check error values, if you want to perform a sequence of possibly-erroring computations, where the successful result of one feeds into the next, there is a lot of typing. In Haskell, you’d just use the <code>Either</code> monad.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to sort a slice, because there are no generics, you need to wrap the slice in another type and implement three methods on that type. So that’s four lines of code to sort a slice of uints, four lines to sort a slice of uint8s, …</p></li></ul></section></article></div></div>

        <a>night</a>
      </p>

      <hr><h2 id="intro"><a href="#intro"></a>Intro</h2>
<p>It is a wonderful day. A Valentine to precise (14/02/2020). I've spent most of the day with my waifu, enjoying little bit of snow and a cup of coffee. Exchanging each other our gifts (just like in the days we were younger). Therefore, this post is also contribution to her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dedicated to my wife, Ara.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inhere, I will show you how easily is to bypass a SketchApp Trial, using nothing more but a Ghidra SRE [1], and a little bit of thinkering. I'm writing this for educational purpose only, but we all have to admit <strong>Sketch.app</strong> is a bit <em>too expensive</em>.  The version I'm working on is <code>Sketch v63.1</code> (latest update).</p>
<h2 id="warming-up"><a href="#warming-up"></a>Warming up</h2>
<p>I highly advice you to create a backup of your Sketch.app (later refered only as <code>Sketch</code>) executable. The usual location for this executable is in <code>/Applications/Sketch.app/Contents/MacOS</code>. The only thing you have to do is copy <code>Sketch</code> in the same directory with a different name.</p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/sketch-how-to-copy.png" alt="Its always good to backup"></p>
<p>Open up Ghidra and create a new project importing Sketch executable from above views. To import, just drag your executable to project view in Ghidra. Refer to Ghidra docs or this [2] phenomenal video by <a href="https://twitter.com/ghidraninja">Ghidra Ninja</a> to learn more about Ghidra basics. This will ease up your reverse engineering if you need to stop and continue to work later on. Now double click on the <code>Sketch</code> from Ghidra project three and let Ghidra analyze the project in full (may take a couple of minutes).</p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/ghidra-sketch-project.png" alt="Sketch.App in Ghidra"></p>
<h2 id="finding-the-trial-implementation"><a href="#finding-the-trial-implementation"></a>Finding the Trial implementation</h2>
<p>There are different ways to find where the trial implementation takes a place. The first and foremost is using XREF string <code>trial days remaining</code> which is shown while starting up the Sketch. The other way is searching for string <code>BCLicenseManager</code> in <code>Symbol Tree</code> window. Since the above string is directly referencing to method <code>numberOfDaysLeftInTrialMode</code>, we can also search for that string excatly in the same window. </p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/ghidra-search-string.png" alt="Method search in Ghidra Project Tree"></p>
<p>When we point Ghidra to this function, we can see the next pseudo-code; which accepts two parameters. The interesting parameter is <code>param_1</code>. The strict business of this parameter is to refer which kind of license is in use. Two options are available in Sketch, if you follow the references: <code>BCRegularLicense</code>, and <code>BCCloudLicense</code>. One is used for offline activation, and the other is used for cloud-based activation. So this <code>BCLicenseManager</code> class has license selector, that returns some license instance.</p>

If we search for method called first (<code>remainingTimeInterval</code>), we can see we were pretty right about two possible license classes references through <code>BCLicenseManager</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/ghidra-search-remainingTimeInterval.png" alt="remainingTimeInterval visible in two classes"></p>
<p>We will work with-in <code>BCRegularLicense</code> since we don't need to deal with cloud protection and adding stuff to <code>/etc/hosts</code>. Lets see what is inside. We have some interesting functions in there called through in: <code>validityInterval</code>, which basically works with <code>endTime</code> (when license should expire) and combination of <code>networkTime/currentTime</code>. We also have <code>isValid</code> method notifying impl. if license is still available for use.</p>

<p>If we follow the about <code>bVar6</code>, it can be either <code>true</code> for expired license, or <code>false</code> for unexpired license.

<p>We are not yet done. The Sketch tries to be smart on us; it checks code signature, meaning if the code signature is not valid, it will exit upon running. Since we patched the binary, the signature of the app will be invalid. But similary to other anti-crack techniques, this one is easy to tackle down. </p>
<p>While inside your Ghidra project, go to <code>0x1004a1724</code> in Dissasemble view, and you will see this code.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was asked by a fellow follower (@kiwamizamurai) on my <a href="https://twitter.com/0xduraki/status/1228682677106114561">Twitter</a> post, how I've found this address.</p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/sketch-update-codesign.png" alt="Twitter Question"></p>
<p>I've found this address by setting up a breakpoint just before the <code>exit</code> syscall and then going step by step in dissasembler. If you try to open up Sketch.app with bad signature you'd get a system error with BAD_CODE_SIGNATURE code. Therefore, I knew the error was due to bad signature. Then I checked which instruction reference to this call. </p>
<hr>

<p>Anyway, At the address <code>0x1004a1738</code>, is instruction JNZ (Jump not equal), which calls code signature method and exit the Sketch. Just replace this jump to the next instruction at <code>0x1004a173e</code>. </p>
