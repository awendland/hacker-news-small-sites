Let's start with an important question...</p><p id="viewer-vcge"><span><em>How much do employees really accomplish in a 40+ hour work weeks? <strong>On avg. 15 hours... </strong></em></span></p><p id="viewer-a7ej"><strong>Wasted Time</strong></p><p id="viewer-8pnvh"><span><strong>-10 Hours/Week</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-fg1q7">Americans typically waste about five to ten hours each week, in their commute to work. That means they may be clocked in for 40 hours each week, but really they invest closer to 50 hours each week. </p><p id="viewer-4bphf"><strong>-10 Hours/Week</strong>
While at work corporate employees must foster and nurture their relationships with their coworkers. That's at least an hour or two of water cooler talk and gossip. </p><p id="viewer-95vrl"><span><strong>-15 Hours/Week</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-4352n">Then there are constraints of managing our existing relationships in our lives through social media and cellular devices that take two or three more hours of our time. </p><p id="viewer-fgpg6">That leaves about three hours of work that actually gets done each day, equalling on average 15 hours of productive work per week. I<span>t is next to impossible to expect employees to work productively for such long periods. You will not get their best work since science explains mental and physical fatigue will set in, no matter the amount of caffeine consumption.</span></p><p id="viewer-4nsh9"><span>Here's the tough part of the sell for the companies to digest. <strong>Pay your employee the same salary that you've paid them for the 40+ hours they currently work.</strong> Now wash that down with some cold hard facts. </span></p><p id="viewer-7kn60"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #1: </strong></p><p id="viewer-d6gkv">Most employees have been more productive since working from home.</p><p id="viewer-8lqkg"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #2:</strong></p><p id="viewer-bismg">Fatigue limits productive work.</p><p id="viewer-ep8oa"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #3:</strong></p><p id="viewer-e6bbk">Happy employees are more productive and perform significantly better.</p><p id="viewer-3k395"><strong>Monday - Work From Home 6 Hours</strong></p><p id="viewer-kf6g">Monday is work from home for six hours. This eliminates the 'Monday Blues' that most employees go through. Imagine after a relaxing Sunday, attending church and finishing errands to prepare for the week ahead, you get to work from home. Your employees become elated, generating more endorphins, which ultimately peaks productivity during this work period (and the rest of the week).</p><p id="viewer-b3cgk"><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - Work In Office 6 Hours</strong></p><p id="viewer-2g9sq">Doing this eliminates fatigue of your employees. Ultimately, maximizing peak performance periods. Less time, equals more attention to detail and more focus, which maximizes this 18 hour period. This also increases revenue for coffee in the morning, and happy hours after work because more time is available. And let's face it, going to work creates a different moral and team chemistry that is ultimately necessary to benefit the company.</p><p id="viewer-bdooq"><strong>Friday, Saturday, Sunday - Off</strong></p><p id="viewer-4sqa4">What do most people do on a three day weekend? Travel locally, travel on quick weekend trips, and ultimately spend more money. Most people are typically paid on Friday. People typically spend their money on the weekend.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Savings accounts allow you to save money with a regulated financial institution and earn some interest. There are several types of savings accounts, but they mostly revolve around three themes - easy access, notice and fixed savings. Easy access accounts allow you to withdraw your money whenever you want. Notice accounts require you to give your provider a few days' notice before making a withdrawal. Fixed accounts allow you to save your money for a fixed period at a guaranteed interest rate. This rate is usually slightly higher than notice or easy access accounts.<br>‍<br><strong>Your money is protected up to £85,000:</strong><br>When you save money in an authorised financial institution, your savings are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means if the financial institution goes bust, you can claim your money back up to £85,000 per financial institution (£170,000 for joint accounts). So, if you have a lot of money to save, it might be wise to spread it across different financial institutions. We recommend you save at most £83,000 in one institution, leaving some room for interest.<br>‍<br>Some of these financial institutions have a shared licence, which means they share their licence with another institution. If you put your money in two institutions that share a licence and both go bust, you'll only be entitled to a maximum of £85,000 from the FSCS. Examples of financial institutions that share a licence are Halifax, Bank of Scotland and BM Savings (all three share the same licence).<br>‍<br><strong>Most people won't pay taxes on savings' income:</strong><br>Depending on your income tax band, you may not have to pay taxes on interest earned on savings. For example, basic-rate taxpayers can earn up to £1,000 in interest tax-free every year. Higher-rate taxpayers can earn up to £500. Additional-rate taxpayers have no tax-free allowance. If you are interested in tax-free accounts, have a look at <a href="https://www.koody.co/saving/isa">ISAs</a>.<br>‍<br>Below, you'll find the easy access, notice and fixed-rate savings accounts which pay the highest interest at the moment. These are not recommendations. They are simply the savings accounts with highest interest rates. All financial institutions we list are regulated by the FCA, and their savings accounts are protected by the FSCS up to £85,000.<br></p><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea8e1014488c25d7742640f/5f227e4d58bbc37bc1507dec_savings-accounts-sign-500x500px.png" alt="Savings accounts are almost tax free" height="300"></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I want to show you some ways to represent puzzles with four spatial dimensions. Even though the fourth dimension is used to make the puzzles more exciting, 4D puzzles can show the simplicity of adding one dimension. Playing these puzzles helps visualizing more dimensions than the three we notice in day-to-day life.</p>
<h2>Dimensions</h2>
<p>If you don't look too closely, a grain of sand is a 0D object, a thread 1D, a piece of paper 2D, and a block of wood 3D.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTQ5NjEucG5n/original/gLK56i.png"></p>
<p>In a 1D world you can only move forward and backward, in 2D you can also move left and right. Moving diagonally is a combination of the others, so doesn't count as a new direction. In 3D you can also go up and down, and for 4D we add two more directions.</p>
<p>To check the number of dimensions of space, get as many sticks as possible perpendicular to each other (as seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KC32Vymo0Q#t=4m50" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>). You get to three in this universe, if your sticks aren't too fancy.</p>
<h2>Projections</h2>
<p>What's the use of talking about four dimensions in a 3D world? The same as talking about 3D games or any other seemingly 3D thing on your 2D computer screen, TV, canvas or paper. Things can feel 3D or 4D, even though the final product is 2D. Squashing an object to lower dimensions, like taking a picture or making a shadow on a wall, is called projection. You can always project, project, project, all the way down to zero dimensions. Here is a projection of a ball:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU2MDEucG5n/original/qq3UFp.png"></p>
<p>and here's the projection from the top of that projection:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAzNDkucG5n/original/Q3XkUN.png"></p>
<h2>Slices</h2>
<p>Our human eyes use projections, but wouldn't it be nicer to be more alien and look at things like an MRI-scanner? Instead of having your vision blocked by the surface of objects, let's slice them up so you can look inside them. You have to choose how thinly you want to slice things. More slices means there is less space per slice in your field of vision, but less slices means you might miss things in between your slices. Here is the sliced up ball, which turns out to have an orange inside:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU2MDIucG5n/original/mFaZ9u.png"></p>
<h2>Pre-chopped space</h2>
<p>Games are easier to slice up if the playing field is made of separate squares, like chess or checkers, where you jump between places. (These are technically 1D, but the 2D description is simpler.) You can then give each square a name or number:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxMjcucG5n/original/GSC5NU.png">,<br>which can be sliced up like this:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNDIucG5n/original/RrCPkZ.png">.<br>The left square in the left slice is next to the left square in the right slice, so 1 is still next to 2 and 3; 2 is still next to 1 and 4, etc. This doesn't accomplish much, but now we have room for a third dimension on our 2D screen:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNTYucG5n/original/IH8VTb.png">,<br>where 1 is now next to 2, 3 and 5. 7 is next to 5, 8 and 3. To get to 4D, we can also put slices vertically:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNzkucG5n/original/J5%2FNYB.png">.<br>Now 1 has four neighbors: 2, 3, 5 and 9, because 5 and 9 are in the same position in adjacent slices. This is like putting two cubes next to each other, and acting like the same positions inside the two cubes are adjacent. </p>
<h2>Mazes</h2>
<p>The most basic way to explore a 4D space is to just walk around. To make the walking around a little bit more interesting, people make mazes.</p>
<h2>Some examples</h2>
<p>Going on a quest to find examples of 4D mazes and puzzles leads you through some great old-school web pages like <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth.htm</a>. There are multiple people who seemingly made it their life's work to collect information about 4D things and mazes. A handy start is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_four-dimensional_games" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_four-dimensional_games</a>.<br>Different types of representations are in that list. First, there's the projection of higher dimensional things on a 2D screen seen in <a href="http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm</a>. </p>
<p>Then there's the option of taking a 3D slice of a 4D world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4aKJuKP0Q" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4aKJuKP0Q</a>. The maker of that video, Marc ten Bosch, has done a lot of work in this field, and is now working on <a href="https://miegakure.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Miegakure</a>. Miegakure stands out because it's more polished than other 4D games, and you can smoothly walk around, instead of step by step. </p>
<p>Finally, instead of slicing just once, you can use the 2D grid of 2D slices we've seen before. This 4D crossword puzzle is a simple example: <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/~crb/misc/xwd65.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ing.iac.es/~crb/misc/xwd65.html</a>, and there's more to be found here: <a href="http://old.nklein.com/products/54321/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://old.nklein.com/products/54321/</a>. Here's a 2x2x2x2 solved crossword:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTUzNTgucG5n/original/%2F0qVeK.png">.<br>Notice words&nbsp;like&nbsp;ai&nbsp;(a&nbsp;type&nbsp;of&nbsp;sloth),&nbsp;ti&nbsp;and&nbsp;no.&nbsp;(aa&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=aa+lava&amp;t=ffab&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images" rel="nofollow noopener">rough lava</a>. <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/2-letter-words.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">This list of 2-letter words</a> was helpful.)
</p>
<h2>Triangles and big wally squares</h2>
<p>If you want to have a clear overview of a 4D maze, this 2D grid of 2D slices is often used. There are two ways these mazes are represented: Spaces with lines in between, or having walls and open squares take up the same amount of space. The first one seems more natural for drawing mazes: you take a blank piece of paper and draw walls on it using your pen lines. The second one is like using graph paper and coloring in squares for walls. <br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTUwNzMucG5n/original/xdpYOa.png"></p>
<p>To walk around in 4D, the thin wall system needs to show possible moves between slices. Usually triangles point in the direction of the square to jump to (like <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/mazes/comments/71syq5/10x10x10x10_4d_maze/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>). In the next picture, the way from 1 to 3 is blocked, but 2 has a triangle pointing to the right, so you can reach 4 from there. The triangle to the left in 4 also allows to go back to 2 from 4. (Everybody colors these triangles, so I do too.)</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNDgucG5n/original/aBTxbK.png"></p>
<p>The thick wall maze expands more naturally to four dimensions when using 2D slices. With square walls, you can move to the same position on adjacent squares. To show a passage, you can show an absent wall on the next slice. This is the system used in <a href="https://trudieprod.itch.io/boxpusher-4d">Boxpusher 4D</a>. </p>
<p> In these examples you can follow the same route from the top left all the way through the maze:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNTAucG5n/original/kMAvRk.png">.</p>
<p>Here is the route:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU0NjAucG5n/original/z6RPSJ.png">.</p>
<p>With thin walls, you need a lot of triangles for a big empty room. Thick walls are thus better for games which have more open spaces:
</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNTIucG5n/original/lu7xCn.png"></p>
<p>Thick wall games also feel less like you're teleporting, although that still is an issue in getting that 4D feeling.</p>
<h2>Making it feel 4D</h2>
<p>Letting things feel 4D instead of some weird thing where you teleport around is quite challenging. One thing that helps is switching dimensions around to show that you get the same puzzle in a different view. Here is the same maze as before to the left, and on the right a version with the dimensions switched:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNTA3MTYucG5n/original/IKuKDY.png">.</p>
<p>On the right, the first six steps are still in a U-shape, but now you jump between slices. Next, where in the left maze you jump two slices to the right, in the right maze there are two little steps. The same steps in both mazes are shown in green.</p>
<p>Something else that works well is when you can't see everything on your screen at once, like with a 10x10x10x10 map on a 4x4x4x4 grid, and you scroll in different directions.</p>
<h2>6D? 20D?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can expand this approach to n dimensions. You do need enough screen space. And it probably gets confusing.</p></section></div>]]>

<p> Modern computer hardware is amazing. Manufacturers have orchestrated billions of pieces of silicon into terrifyingly complex and efficient structures that sweep electrons through innumerable tangled paths, branchings, and reunions with the sole purpose of performing computations at more than a billion times per second. This awe-inspiring piece of computational wizardry has at its disposal multiple billions of uniquely addressible silicon plates where it can store the results of millions of computations in an array of several vanishingly small chips. All of this hardware, though each component often sits no further than 7 or 8 centimeters away from the others, cycles so fast that the speed of light, a physical law of the universe, limits the rate at which they communicate with each other.
</p><p><span>So why is software still slow?</span>
</p><p>Why does it take your operating system 10 seconds, 30 seconds, a minute to boot up? Why does your word processor freeze when you save a document on the cloud? Why does your web browser take 3, 4, 10 seconds to load a web page? Why does your phone struggle to keep more than a few apps open at a time? And why does each update somehow make the problem worse?
</p><p><span>We made it slow</span>.
</p><p>Not necessarily you, not necessarily me, not necessarily any single person in particular. But we, the software development community, made it slow by ignoring the fundamental reality of our occupation. We write code, code that runs on computers. Real computers, with central processing units and random access memory and hard disk drives and display buffers. Real computers, with integer and bitwise math and floating point units and L2 caches, with threads and cores and a tenuous little network connection to a million billion other computers. Real computers not built for ease of human understanding but for blindingly, incomprehensibly fast speed.
</p><p><span>A lot of us have forgotten that</span>.
</p><p>In our haste to get our products, our projects, the works of our hands and minds, to as many people as possible, we take shortcuts. We make assumptions. We generalize, and abstract, and assume that just because these problems have been solved before that they never need to be solved again. We build abstraction layers, then forget we built them and build more on top.
</p><p>And it's true that many of us think we do not have the time, the money, the mental bandwidth to always consider these things in detail. The deadline is approaching or the rent is due or we have taxes to fill out and a manager on our back and someone asking us why we always spend so much time at the office, and we just have to stick the library or virtual machine or garbage collector in there to cover up the places we can't think through right now.
</p><p>Others of us were never taught to think about the computer itself. We learned about objects and classes and templates and how to make our code clean and pretty. We learned how to write code to make the client or the manager or the teacher happy, but made the processor churn. And because we did, that amazing speed we'd been granted was wasted, by us, in a death by a thousand abstraction layers.
</p><p><span>But some of us aren't satisfied with that.</span>
</p><p>Some of us take a few extra steps into the covered territory, the wheels sitting, motionless, in a pile behind us, examine their designs and decide there is a better way. The more experienced among us remember how software used to be, the potential that we know exists for computer programs to be useful, general, <em>and</em> efficient. Others of us got fed up with the tools we were expected to use without complaint, but which failed us time and time again. Some of us are just curious and don't know what's good for us. Don't trust what we've been told is good for us.
</p><p>We sat down and looked at our hardware, and examined our data, and thought about how to use the one to transform the other. We tinkered, and measured, and read, and compared, and wrote, and refined, and modified, and measured again, over and over, until we found we had built the same thing, but 10 times faster and incomparably more useful to the people we designed it for. And we had built it by hand.
</p><p>That is what Handmade means. It's not a technique or a language or a management strategy, it isn't a formula or a library or an abstraction. It's an idea. The idea that we can build software that works with the computer, not against it. The idea that sometimes an individual programmer can be more productive than a large team, that a small group can do more than an army of software engineers and *do it better*. The idea that programming is about transforming data and we wield the code, the tool we use to bend that data to our will.
</p><p> It doesn't require a degree, or a dissertation, or a decade of experience. You don't need an
expensive computer or a certificate or even prior knowledge. All you need is an open mind and a sense of
curiosity. We'll help you with the rest.
</p><p><span>Will you join us?</span>
</p><p>Will you build your software by hand?</p>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my Coronavirus Genome Walkthrough.</p>

<p>(Hoping someone comes out with that Vaccine Speedrun soon. This boss battle is really shaping up to be an intense one and we’ll need all the artifacts we can get.)</p>

<p>Here, I aim to provide a <em>mechanistic explanation</em> of the SARS-CoV-2 genome’s syntax and semantics. Let’s investigate what the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome actually does as if reading through code like a compiler, from nucleotides to amino acids all the way to proteins. From the four base pairs all the way up to the completed protein-coated virus, what is a virus like this is actually made of on the concrete, physical level?</p>

<h3 id="understanding-a-full-system">Understanding a Full System</h3>

<p>The underlying purpose of this essay is less about the coronavirus <em>per se</em> and more about how having a small—but functionally complete—piece of viral RNA to analyze gives me a unique opportunity to try to understand a complete self-replicating machine from scratch. This is not a feat that I would have the fortitude to manually replicate with the full human genome, for example—but the coronavirus genome, like the <a href="http://openworm.org/">nematode genome</a>, is small enough that we stand a chance at building a complete understanding. The task is perhaps akin to <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">interpretability</a>, but for biological systems instead of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>As a consequence, this essay is not intended to produce epidemiological conclusions; there are plenty of other sources for that! This essay is about fully understanding a biological system at the chemical and physical level.</p>

<h3 id="play-curiosity-and-mechanical-understanding">Play, Curiosity, and Mechanical Understanding</h3>

<p>Throughout this essay, I follow my curiosity in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_play">serious play</a>: if I <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">notice I’m confused</a> about something, I look into it and explore it until I’m satisfied that I now understand, and that my understanding is <em>a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/#ConMec">mechanical</a> understanding</em>. Things are made of stuff! It turns out that we can understand that stuff!</p>

<p>I may skip over some details that were not confusing to me during my own research, but your journey need not be the same as mine. If you’re confused about something while reading this essay, I encourage you to go and look it up! <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html">Notice</a> when your curiosity arises; that’s the meditation. Together, we can <a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/">learn new things</a>.</p>

<p>This all, at least, has been my intention as I set out to create this piece! As Ken Liu said of his philosophy while translating The Three-Body Problem, “I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.”</p>

<p>Part 1, here, covers just the genome and its translation to proteins. I hope to also write a Part 2 which would cover the structure and function of those proteins, their protein-protein interactions, and the full viral life cycle.</p>

<!--Finally, as you may already be able to tell, this essay also serves as a philosophical manifesto-by-example of how to think concretely about problems in biology. Along the way, I give some of my thoughts about the role of thermodynamics in molecular biology, legibility in complex systems, pedagogy, and the future of computational modeling.-->

<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<p>As a reminder, SARS-CoV-2 is a <em>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</em>.</p>



<p>What does this mean we can expect?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Single-stranded</em>: Its genome is a single strand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> (ssRNA).</li>
  <li><em>Positive-sense</em>: That single strand of RNA can be immediately translated into protein by the ribosomes of the cell it infects.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this we can also infer that one of the proteins the virus encodes for must be <em>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</em> (RdRP), a protein which synthesizes new RNA given an RNA template. That’s right: RNA → RNA. However, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, isn’t RNA → RNA an unconscionable heresy? Correspondingly, RdRP is not naturally found in cells! All known positive-sense ssRNA viruses therefore <em>must encode</em> RdRP in order to successfully commit this heresy.</p>



<p>…Wait a minute, the phrase “positive-sense ssRNA virus” implies the existence of <em>negative-sense</em> viruses. If those don’t encode their proteins directly, how can they possibly work?</p>

<h2 id="positive-sense-and-negative-sense">Positive sense and negative sense</h2>

<p>Negative-sense ssRNA viruses also exist! Influenza, Ebola, and measles are examples.</p>



<p>The inner contents of <em>negative-sense</em> ssRNA viruses consist not of an RNA genome but of a <em>ribonucleoprotein</em>, which incorporates both an RNA genome as well as a cohort of viral proteins capable of replicating RNA. Unlike positive-sense ssRNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses must travel with a working copy of their RNA-replicating proteins. This ribonucleoprotein has enzymatic activity!</p>

<h2 id="rdrp-as-drug-target">RdRP as drug target</h2>

<p>Since RdRP has (as far as I know) no legitimate purpose in human cells and is not naturally coded by them, might it offer a potential target for novel antiviral drugs?</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">Velkov et al. 2014</a> explores RdRP as a drug target for antivirals against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus">Hendra virus</a>, a negative-sense ssRNA virus, though I am unable to find the full text.</p>

<!-- <div class="unfurl-embed-info-media-default gallery-item-selectable"><img class="unfurl-embed-card-feature-image" src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image.png"><div class="unfurl-embed-card-title unfurl-embed-card-title-default notranslate"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">The RNA-dependent-RNA Polymerase, an Emerging Antiviral Drug Target for the Hendra Virus - PubMed</a></div><div class="unfurl-embed-card-description unfurl-embed-card-description-default notranslate"><div style="overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 2;">Australia is facing a major national medical challenge with the emergence of the Hendra virus (HeV) as a medically and economically important pathogen of humans and animals.

<blockquote>
  <p>This review examines the current knowledge based on the multi-domain architecture of the Hendra RdRP and highlights which essential domain functions represent tangible targets for drug development against this deadly disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There must be some reason that developing antivirals against this protein is technically (or socially) complicated, or I’d have expected us to do it by now – there are a lot of RNA viruses that this drug target could theoretically hit. Flagging this discrepancy for further research.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Back to SARS-CoV-2! First, let’s get us a genome. Obviously this virus has seen some mutations as it’s spread around, as you can explore at <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">NextStrain</a>, so we’ve technically got choices as to which one to analyze. For this thread I’ll just stick to analyzing <em>one</em> version of the genome: Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>As a reminder, each <code>A</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>T</code> in a genome is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a>. There are actually <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/publications.html">plenty of ways to engineer</a> different <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850726/">unnatural base pair systems</a> by adding <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/884">artificial nucleotides</a>, and these can even be integrated into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4922">transcription</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24659">translation</a>, but <a href="https://carlbrannen.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-does-dna-only-use-4-nucleotides/">for</a> <a href="https://dreamerbiologist.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/why-did-nature-settle-on-just-four-nucleotides/">whatever</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/E6476">reason</a>, these four <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07389-2">and not others</a> are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/">what life ultimately ended up with</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/nucleotides.png"></p>
<p><small>The four nucleotides in DNA.</small></p>

<p>The genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, each <code>T</code> in this string technically represents a <code>U</code>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil">uracil</a>, RNA’s information-equivalent of thymine. The genome sequence is therefore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1     AUUAAAGGUU UAUACCUUCC CAGGUAACAA ACCAACCAAC UUUCGAUCUC UUGUAGAUCU
61    GUUCUCUAAA CGAACUUUAA AAUCUGUGUG GCUGUCACUC GGCUGCAUGC UUAGUGCACU
121   CACGCAGUAU AAUUAAUAAC UAAUUACUGU CGUUGACAGG ACACGAGUAA CUCGUCUAUC

...

29761 ACAGUGAACA AUGCUAGGGA GAGCUGCCUA UAUGGAAGAG CCCUAAUGUG UAAAAUUAAU
29821 UUUAGUAGUG CUAUCCCCAU GUGAUUUUAA UAGCUUCUUA GGAGAAUGAC AAAAAAAAAA
29881 AAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAA AAA
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>That’s 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits; the virus’s genome therefore requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store. That’s roughly as much data, byte for byte, as there are characters in this essay up to this point!</p>

<!-- <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02212445/Figure_03_05_03.png"> -->

<p>Lay out those 29,903 nucleobases along a ribose-phosphate backbone, reading them left to right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directionality_(molecular_biology)">from the 5’ end to the 3’ end</a>, and bam – if that single molecule* were teleported into a cell, that’s 100% chemically sufficient** to infect a person with the plague du jour.</p>

<p><small>How to interpret the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome as a complete molecule.</small></p>

<h2 id="poly-a-tail">Poly-A tail</h2>

<p>First question, and perhaps the most obvious one to the naked eye – what’s with all the <code>AAAAA</code> at the end of the viral genome?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>29821 ...                                                ... AAAAAAAAAA

</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>It’s… yelling at us? Is it… suffering? Should we <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/">help</a>?</p>

<p>Simple: It’s a <a href="https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/11227/why-does-the-sars-cov2-coronavirus-genome-end-in-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa">3’ poly-A tail</a>! This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">long tail of adenosine monomers</a> is extremely common in both our own cells and in RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Our own messenger RNA (mRNA) has a poly-A tail when it’s freshly produced in the nucleus so as to slow its degradation by the cell, allowing it to last long enough to be transcribed into protein. Naturally, if you’re a positive-strand RNA virus, you’re also going to want to last long enough to be transcribed into protein – so, you need the same feature, yourself.</p>

<p>Genome 0.11% explained. So far so good!</p>

<h2 id="5-cap">5’ cap</h2>

<p>While we’re discussing chemical features of mRNA, note that the viral genome presumably must also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> – an extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Methylguanosine">7-methylguanosine</a> at the 5’ end of its RNA strand – just like mRNAs do.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/5primecap.png"></p>
<p><small>A 5' cap, consisting of a 7-methylguanosine as well as methylation of the first two ribose sugars.</small></p>

<p>The cap is not directly shown in the viral genome sequence or mentioned in NCBI GenBank, but it is referenced in multiple papers discussing coronaviral genomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5′ ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like the poly-A tail, the 5’ cap helps the genome to be recognized and translated by ribosomes rather than destroyed by the cell’s immune response.</p>

<p>How does the virus even ensure that it receives a 5’ cap and a poly-A tail, not to mention its outer coat? Hopefully these questions will be resolved by our review of its genes and proteins… let’s move on to look at those!</p>



<p>Per the “Features” section of the genome, again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>, here are the identifiable genes in this genome, in order:</p>

      <p><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are often praised as the "holy grail" for building collaborative applications because they don't require a central authority to resolve sync conflicts. They open up new possibilities to scale the backend infrastructure and are also well-suited as a data-model for distributed apps that don't require a server at all.</p><p>However, several text editor developers report not to use them because they impose a too significant overhead.</p><p>Just recently, Marijn Haverbeke wrote about his considerations against using CRDTs as a data model for <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a>:</p><blockquote>[..] the cost of such a representation is significant, and in the end, I judged the requirement for converging positions to be too obscure to justify that level of extra complexity and memory use. <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">(source)</a></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi Editor</a> used a CRDT as its data model to allow different processes (syntax highlighter, type checker, ..) to concurrently access the editor state without blocking the process. They reverted to a synchronous model because ..</p><blockquote>[..] CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">(source)</a></blockquote><p>Apparently, everyone recognizes that CRDTs have a lot of potential, but concluded that the memory overhead of using them must be too expensive for real-world applications.</p><p>They bring up a fair point. Most CRDTs assign a unique ID to <em>every character</em> that was ever created in the document. In order to ensure that documents can always converge, the CRDT model preserves this metadata even when characters are deleted.</p><p>This seems to be particularly expensive in dynamic languages like JavaScript. Other languages allow you to efficiently represent all those characters and IDs in-memory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a> (e.g. C or Rust). In JavaScript, everything is represented as an <code>Object</code> - basically a key-value map that needs to keep track of all its keys and values. CRDTs assign multiple properties to every single character in the document to ensure conflict resolution. The memory overhead of merely representing a document as a CRDT could be immense.</p><p>Every user-interaction creates more metadata that the CRDT needs to retain in order to ensure conflict resolution. It is not uncommon that CRDTs create millions of objects to store all this metadata. The JavaScript engine manages these objects on the heap, checks if they are referenced, and, if possible, garbage collects them. Another major problem is that with an increasing number of object creations, the cost of creating additional objects increases exponentially. This is shown in the following graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png 600w"><figcaption>Average time to create one object increases with the number of objects on the heap <a href="https://jsperf.com/cost-of-objects">(Data Source)</a></figcaption></figure><p>So the question arises if CRDTs are actually suitable for shared editing on the web, or if they impose a too significant cost to be viable in practice.</p><p>In case you don't know me, I'm the author of a CRDT implementation named <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs">Yjs</a>, that is specifically designed for building shared editing applications on the web.</p><p>In this article, I will introduce you to a simple optimization for CRDTs and examine the exact performance trade-off of using Yjs for shared editing. I hope to convince you that the overhead is actually very small even for large documents with long edit histories.</p><h2 id="yjs">Yjs</h2><p>Yjs is a framework for building collaborative applications using CRDTs as the data model. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions that enable shared editing using different editors (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-prosemirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/prosemirror">ProseMirror</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remirror/extension-yjs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror">Remirror</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-quilljs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/quill">Quill</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/codemirror">CodeMirror</a>, ..), different networking technologies (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket">WebSocket</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-webrtc">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-hyper">Hyper</a>, ..), and different persistence layers (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-indexeddb">IndexedDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-leveldb">LevelDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-redis">Redis</a>, ..). Most shared editing solutions are tied to a specific editor and to a specific backend. With Yjs, you can make any of the supported editors collaborative and exchange document updates through your custom communication channel, over a peer-to-peer WebRTC network, or over a scalable server infrastructure. My vision for this project is that you can simply compose your collaborative application using the technologies that make sense for your project. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs"><div><p>yjs/yjs</p><p>Peer-to-peer shared types.

Yjs is by far the fastest web-based CRDT implementation with the most efficient encoding. In this article I will often refer to specific benchmarks contained in the <code>crdt-benchmarks</code> repository as, for example, "<a href="https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks/#b1-no-conflicts">[B1.11]</a>".</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks"><div><p>dmonad/crdt-benchmarks</p><p>A collection of CRDT benchmarks.

If not, and you want to dive into this rabbit hole, I recommend this fun interactive series:</p><figure><a href="https://lars.hupel.info/topics/crdt/01-intro/"><div><p>CRDTs: Part 1</p><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/profile.jpg"><span>Lars Hupel</span><span>Lars Hupel</span></p></div><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/topics/crdt/world.jpg"></p></a><figcaption>A fun interactive series about CRDTs</figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://crdt.tech/resources"><div><p>CRDT Resources • Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</p><p>Resources and community around CRDT technology — papers, blog posts, code and more.</p><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/favicons/favicon-192x192.png"><span>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</span></p></div><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/img/crdt-favicon.png"></p></a><figcaption>Good entry point to find more CRDT related resources</figcaption></figure><p>The concept paper that describes Yjs' conflict resolution algorithm YATA is available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types">Researchgate</a>. The concepts discussed here are pretty generic and could be extended to almost any CRDT.</p><p>In order to determine the performance cost, we are are going to examine how Yjs maintains data. Please bear with me while I describe how the CRDT model is represented using JavaScript objects. This will be relevant later.</p><p>Similarly to other CRDTs, the YATA CRDT assigns a unique ID to every character. These characters are then maintained in a doubly linked list.</p><p>The unique IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp"> Lamport Timestamps</a>. They consist of a unique user identifier and a logical clock that increases with each character insertion.</p><p>When a user types the content "ABC" from left to right, it will perform the following operations: <code>insert(0, "A") • insert(1, "B") • insert(2, "C")</code>. The linked list of the YATA CRDT, which models the textual content, will look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/crdt-datamodel.svg" alt=""><figcaption>CRDT model of inserting content "ABC" (assuming the user has the unique client identifier "1")</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how every character can be uniquely identified by the combination of the unique client-id and an ever-increasing <code>clock</code> counter.</p><p>Yjs represents the items of the linked list as <code>Item</code> objects that contain some content (in this case a String), a unique ID, the links to the adjacent <code>Item</code> objects, and additional metadata that is relevant for the CRDT algorithm.</p><p>All CRDTs assign some kind of unique ID and additional metadata to every character, which is very memory-consuming for large documents. We can't get rid of metadata as it is necessary for conflict resolution. Yjs also uniquely identifies each character and assigns metadata, but represents this information efficiently. Larger document insertions are represented as a single <code>Item</code> object using the character-offset to uniquely identify each character individually. The below <code>Item</code> uniquely identifies character <code>"A"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 0 }</code>, character <code>"B"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 1 }</code>, and so on..</p><figure><pre><code>Item {
    id: { client: 1, clock: 0 },
    content: 'ABC',
    ...
}</code></pre><figcaption>Yjs's internal representation of items in the linked list</figcaption></figure><p>If a user copy/pastes a lot of content into the document, the inserted content is represented by a single <code>Item</code>. Furthermore, single-character insertions that are written from left to right can be merged into a single <code>Item</code>. It is just important that we are able to split and merge items without losing any metadata.</p><p>This type of compound representation of the CRDT model and its split-functionality have first been described in <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-a-string-wise-crdt-algorithm-for-smart-and-large-scale-collaborative-editing-sys.html">"A string-wise CRDT algorithm for smart and large-scale collaborative systems"</a>. Yjs adapts this approach for YATA and also includes functionality to merge <code>Item</code> objects.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-operations">The Cost of Operations</h2><p>With this simple optimization in mind, let's have a look at how the number of modifications on a document relates to the amount of metadata that needs to be retained. We will measure metadata by the amount of <code>Item</code> objects created and later examine what the cost of a single <code>Item</code> is.</p><p>Every user interaction with a text editor can be expressed as either an <strong>insert</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong> operation.</p><ul><li><code>insert(index: number, content: string)</code><strong> </strong>Insertions of any size create a single <code>Item</code> that is integrated into the document. In some cases the integration requires to split an existing <code>Item</code>. So we have a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations per insertion.</li><li><code>delete(index: number, length: number)</code> Deleting an <code>Item</code> only marks it as deleted. I.e <code>item.deleted = true</code>. Therefore, <code>Item</code> deletions are free and will reduce the amount of memory used because the <code>Item.content</code> can be removed. The <code>Item</code> doesn't need to retain the content for doing conflict resolution. But deleting a range of content might require to split two existing items. Therefore, the cost of deletions is a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations also.</li></ul><p>By using the compound representation of CRDTs, the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations produced by a user. Not to the amount of characters inserted. This makes a huge difference in practice. Most larger documents are created by copy-pasting existing content or by moving paragraphs to other positions. Any kind of operation, even copy-paste and undo/redo, only create at most two <code>Item</code> objects.</p><p>Yjs also supports rich-text and structured documents. The above statement, that the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations, still holds true for these kinds of documents. But measuring operation-cost for more complex operations is out of scope of this article. An interesting observation in practice is that the document size of long-running …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

		<p><em><span>A</span></em><span><em><span>n Ecology of Mind</span></em></span><span> </span><span> is a film portrait of Gregory Bateson, celebrated anthropologist, philosopher, author, naturalist, systems theorist, and filmmaker, produced and directed by his daughter, Nora Bateson.</span></p>
		<p><span>T<span>he</span></span><span> film includes footage from Bateson’s own films shot in the 1930s in Bali (with Margaret Mead) and New Guinea, along with photographs, filmed lectures, and interviews.  His youngest child, Nora, depicts him as a man who studied the interrelationships of the complex systems in which we live with a depth motivated by scientific rigor and caring integrity.</span></p>
		<p><span>N<span>ora</span></span> Bateson’s rediscovery of his work documents the vast – and continuing – influence Bateson’s thinking has had on the work of an amazingly wide range of disciplines.  Through contemporary interviews, along with his own words, Bateson’s way of thinking reveals practical approaches to the enormous challenges confronting the human race and the natural world.</p>
		<p><span>G<span>regory</span></span> Bateson’s theories, such as “the double bind” and “the pattern which connects”, continue to impact the fields of anthropology, psychiatry, information science, cybernetics, urban planning, biology, and ecology, challenging people to think in new ways.   </p>
		<p><span>U</span><span>ntil now, his work has been largely inaccessible to most of us.  Through this film, Nora Bateson sets out to show that his ideas are not just fodder for academic theory, but can help instruct a way of life. She presents his thinking using a richly personal perspective, focusing on the stories Bateson used to present his ideas and how the beauty of life itself provided the framework of his life’s pursuits.</span></p>
		<p><span>T</span><span>his film hopes to inspire its audience to see our lives within a larger system - glistening with symmetry, play, and metaphor. An invitation to ask the kinds of questions that could help thread the world back together from the inside.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

</section>
<p>When I graduated from college, my dream was to lead a team at a startup. Over the past decade, I’ve had the opportunity to serve in a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/work/">variety of engineering and management roles</a> with funded tech startups and, most recently I joined The Graide Network as their <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/joining-the-graide-network">Chief Technology Officer</a>.</p>
<p>The Graide Network was my dream job. I got to pick the tech stack, hire the team, make important decisions, and speak and write about all of it. It was challenging, exciting, and it felt like something I’d want to do forever.</p>
<p>In 2020, when Covid-19 struck, the business hit a wall. Our customers (K-12 schools) tightened their budgets, and like many early-stage startups, we had to let a few team members go. I had been managing the engineering team for four years, and now and after Covid, the team had contracted to just one other developer and me.</p>
<p>As I reflected on my career, I realized that it was time for a change. I had grown very comfortable as an early-stage startup CTO, and I was afraid that by continuing with The Graide Network (or finding a similar startup job), I would remain safely in my comfort zone forever.</p>
<h2 id="the-comfort-zone-the-most-dangerous-place-to-be">The Comfort Zone: The Most Dangerous Place to Be</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you opt for a safe life, you will never know what it’s like to win.”
<strong>- Richard Branson</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mECllQz.jpg" alt="Get out of your comfort zone"></p>
<p>Every leap forward I’ve made in my career has been followed by a visceral, gut-wrenching increase in anxiety.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember being brought into a meeting with the founders when I was at Packback and being told that our Head of Engineering was leaving and that I’d be taking over. I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t stop thinking, worrying, and asking myself what the hell I was going to do.</p>
<p>The same feeling carried me through <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/one-year-conference-summary">my first conference talk</a>. I had spoken in front of small audiences in meetings and informal settings, but being on stage with lights and a microphone, and a timer was sickening. I basically blacked out and, at some point, walked off stage while people clapped politely.</p>
<p>But, after leading small engineering teams for over five years at early stage startups, the job had become mundane. I had a process for everything, I knew what the most likely technical and business challenges were going to be, and I was getting great reviews from my teammates. I’m not saying I was the world’s best engineer or manager, but I had reached a level of adequacy that allowed me to be very comfortable.</p>
<p>While living in my comfort zone, I wasn’t having sleepless periods of frantic anxiety, but I also wasn’t growing.</p>
<h2 id="the-hedgehog-concept">The Hedgehog Concept</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hedgehog Concept comes from the Greek fable about the fox and the hedgehog: while the wily fox knows many things, the simple hedgehog only knows one thing, but that one knowledge bite is highly impactful in protecting itself against danger.
<strong>- Jim Collins</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing that I needed to be chasing growth, I began contemplating a more significant career pivot, and <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html">Jim Collins’ Hedgehog Concept</a> kept coming to mind. The Hedgehog Concept says that to build something <em>great</em>, you have to focus on the intersection of these three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are you deeply passionate about?</li>
<li>What can you be the best in the world at?</li>
<li>What drives your economic engine?</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D7CA14F8F5FDBCC0CAA5D1A347773A815DA981E958DB2DB5DE1BEBB0452535C7_1597613694050_hedgehog.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Collins was talking about building companies, but it’s true for careers as well. My job as an engineering leader had allowed me to earn good money, but I wasn’t going to be the best in the world at it, and I wouldn’t call engineering my life’s passion. When I think about what people might say at my funeral, it’s not, “Oh, Karl, he was a great engineer.”</p>
<p>As I started exploring my options, talking to friends and mentors, and weighing various business ideas, I kept wondering what I really wanted to be the “best in the world at?”</p>
<h2 id="the-best-at-one-thing-or-pretty-good-at-two-things">The Best at One Thing or Pretty Good at Two Things?</h2>
<p>Several years ago, I read <a href="https://amzn.to/2BEjOWx"><em>How To Fail at Almost Everything And Still Win Big</em></a>, by Dilbert creator Scott Adams. While I don’t agree with much of Adams’ politics, the book is full of sage advice for anyone who thinks differently from the mainstream.</p>
<p>One of my biggest takeaways was Adams’ idea about combining skills:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:</p>
<ol>
<li>Become the best at one specific thing.</li>
<li>Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility…I don’t recommend anyone even try. The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.
<strong>-</strong> <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html"><strong>Scott Adams</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adams goes on to talk about how he was never going to be the best cartoonist, but he was pretty good at it and had a business background that was unique in the field. He realized that he didn’t want to compete with the best cartoonists, but instead to compete with the <em>very few</em> people who were good cartoonists with a prior career in business.</p>
<p>This simple yet brilliant idea makes becoming successful an order of magnitude easier.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>As I thought about my skills, passions, and the things that people would pay me for, I started to think about <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/writing/">writing</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved writing. It’s therapeutic and allows me to help, teach, and encourage others. My final internship in college was as a technical writer, and a few companies had approached me about writing for their blogs. I figured that if I could find a few clients to pay me to write, I’d make a go of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-two-months">The First Two Months</h2>
<p>In May 2020, I <a href="https://github.com/malgamves/CommunityWriterPrograms">found a list of freelance technical writing opportunities</a>, and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/start-freelance-blogging">I started applying</a>. By June, I had written for six different clients, and I was starting to trade out some of my lower-paying clients for higher-paying ones. I wasn’t making as much as I would as a developer, but I started to see a path forward.</p>
<p>I talked to my CEO at The Graide Network to let her know that <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-gave-my-notice-im-going-full-time-b37d46266b">I’d be transitioning out</a> by the end of the summer. I offered to ramp down slowly and stay on as a part-time advisor if she thought it would help. This eased the transition and allowed me to start thinking about how I could make a real living as a writer.</p>
<h2 id="the-fish-start-biting">The Fish Start Biting</h2>
<p>After writing a few articles and continuing to comb through my network, I had more work than I could handle.</p>
<p>I found out that companies have a really hard time finding experienced software engineers who are also good writers and started to wonder if the market might be bigger than I first thought. I was doing almost zero outbound sales and still being approached by 2-3 new clients per week. Several of my early clients had mentioned job opportunities, and people referred business to me from all over.</p>
<p>So, I did the logical thing and kept raising my rates.</p>
<p>While this priced out some of my early clients, they understood that I needed to make a living.</p>
<h2 id="so-this-is-product-market-fit">So this is Product-Market Fit?</h2>
<p>As I continued to field interest, I kept thinking about Justin Jackson’s essay, <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jump"><em>What Does Product-Market Fit Feel Like?</em></a> In it, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without you having to try too hard, customers should be showing up to buy your product…Many of the problems entrepreneurs face are related to <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/niche"><strong>targeting a niche</strong></a> where there aren’t a lot of fish, or the fish aren’t biting.
<strong>- Justin Jackson</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had worked with several startups where sales were <em>by far</em> the biggest challenge. Reflecting on those experiences, I realized that <strong>my past startups were trying to convince people to pay for something completely new.</strong> While this path makes sense for funded startups, I expected to spend months finding my first few clients, and instead, I had stumbled into a pond filled with hungry fish. It was exciting and a little bit scary.</p>
<p>I started to think about what it would take to scale this business up.</p>
<h2 id="productize-and-scale">Productize and Scale</h2>
<p>I’ve been listening to <a href="http://bootstrappedweb.com/">Brian Casel’s Bootstrapped Web podcast</a> for the past year. Brian runs a business called <a href="https://audienceops.com/">AudienceOps</a>, a “productized” content writing service where he’s been able to serve more clients and grow a profitable lifestyle business that runs mostly without him.</p>
<p>While I enjoy writing, I was nervous about freelancing full-time forever. What happens if I want to take a month off? If I have to keep increasing my rates, will I only be able to work with huge, boring clients? Will I get sick of writing variations on the same few technical topics for years?</p>
<p>One of my long-term career goals has always been to start a business. Freelancers may be self-employed, but they’re really just working several small jobs, so I knew I wanted to do something bigger than that.</p>
<p>In July, I stopped taking clients who wanted to hire me specifically and started redirecting them to my fledgling agency, <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft</a>. While I imagine I’ll continue doing much of the writing this year, hiring other writers allows me to continue focusing on hard (to me) problems like sales, marketing, and building processes.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-corner-store">The New “Corner Store”</h2>
<p>Compared with the ambitious, venture-funded startups I worked for in the past, Draft is so…simple. There are customers with a need, and I have a skill that helps them meet that need. If I’m smart, I’ll be able to operationalize it and get out of the day-to-day within a few years. To me, that sounds like a fascinating problem to solve, even if it’s not something worthy of outside investment.</p>
<p>I see online lifestyle businesses like mine as the “corner store” of our generation. Our grandparents could lease a storefront, and (with a little luck and hard work) ride the wave of growing prosperity in their neighborhood to make a living. I’m not going to build the next Facebook, but there’s enough growth in the technology sector to make a living in lots of little niches you might not have expected.</p>
<p>So that’s why I left my career as a startup CTO to become a writer. <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Find me on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://mailchi.mp/a183cf10b418/startups">sign up for my newsletter</a> if you want to follow along.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>In this post we'll write a Python to C compiler in Python. This is
especially easy to do since Python has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">builtin parser
library</a> and because a
number of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/">CPython internals are exposed for extension
writers</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of this post, in a few hundred lines of Python, we'll be able to
compile and run the following program:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat tests/recursive_fib.py
def fib(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n

    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)


def main():
    print(fib(40))
$ python3 pyc tests/recursive_fib.py
$ ./bin/a.out
102334155
</code></pre>
<p>This post implements an extremely small subset of Python and
<strong>completely gives up on even trying to manage memory</strong> because I
cannot fathom manual reference counting. Maybe some day I'll find a
way to swap in an easy GC like Boehm.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/pyc">Source code for this project is available on Github.</a></p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3><p>We'll need Python3, GCC, libpython3, and clang-format.</p>
<p>On Fedora-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dnf install gcc python3-devel clang-format python3
</code></pre>
<p>And on Debian-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install gcc python3-dev clang-format python3
</code></pre>
<p>
  This program will likely work as well on Windows, Mac, FreeBSD,
  etc. but I haven't gone through the trouble of testing this (or
  providing custom compiler directives). Pull requests welcome!
</p><h3 id="a-hand-written-first-pass">A hand-written first-pass</h3><p>Before we get into the compiler, let's write the fibonacci program by
hand in C using libpython.</p>
<p>As described in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html#very-high-level-embedding">Python embedding
guide</a>
we'll need to include libpython and initialize it in
our <code>main.c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Py_Initialize();

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To compile against libpython, we'll use
<a href="https://helpmanual.io/man1/python3-config/">python3-config</a> installed
as part of <code>python3-devel</code> to tell us what should be linked
at each step during compilation.</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -c -o main.o $(python3-config --cflags) main.c
$ gcc $(python3-config --ldflags) main.o
$ ./a.out; echo $?
0
</code></pre>
<p>Cool! Now as we think about translating the fibonacci implementation,
we want to keep everything as Python objects for as long as
possible. This means passing and receiving
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html">PyObject*</a> to and from
all functions, and converting all C integers to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html">PyLong</a>, a "subtype" of
<code>PyObject*</code>. You can imagine that everything in Python is
an <code>object</code> until you operate on it.</p>
<p>
  For more information on objects in Python, check out
  the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">Data
  model</a> page in Python docs.
</p><p>To map a C integer to a <code>PyLong*</code> we use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_FromLong">PyLong_FromLong</a>. To
map in reverse, we use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_AsLong">PyLong_AsLong</a>.</p>
<p>To compare two <code>PyObject*</code>s we can use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html#c.PyObject_RichCompareBool">PyObject_RichCompareBool</a>
which will handle the comparison regardless of the type of the two
parameters. Without this helper we'd have to write complex checks to
make sure that the two sides are the same and if they are, unwrap them
into their underlying C value and compare the C value.</p>
<p>We can use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Add">PyNumber_Add</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Subtract">PyNumber_Subtract</a>
for basic arithmetic, and there are many similar helpers available to
us for operations down the line.</p>
<p>Now we can write a translation:</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

PyObject* fib(PyObject* n) {
  PyObject* zero = PyLong_FromLong(0);
  PyObject* one = PyLong_FromLong(1);
  if (PyObject_RichCompareBool(n, zero, Py_EQ) || PyObject_RichCompareBool(n, one, Py_EQ)) {
    return n;
  }

  PyObject* left = fib(PyNumber_Subtract(n, one));

  PyObject* two = PyLong_FromLong(2);
  PyObject* right = fib(PyNumber_Subtract(n, two));

  return PyNumber_Add(left, right);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Py_Initialize();

  PyObject* res = fib(PyLong_FromLong(7)); // Should be 13

  return PyLong_AsLong(res);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -c -o main.o $(python3-config --cflags) main.c
$ gcc $(python3-config --ldflags) main.o
$ ./a.out; echo $?
13
</code></pre>
<p>That's great! But we cheated in one place. We assumed that the input
to the <code>fib</code> function was an integer, and we propagated
that assumption everywhere we wrote <code>PyNumber_*</code>
operations. When we write the compiler, we'll need to check that both
arguments are an integer before we call a numeric helper, otherwise we
may need to call a string concatenation helper or something else
entirely.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-architecture">Compiler Architecture</h3><p>We'll break the code into four major parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>libpyc.c</code>: helper functions for generated code</li>
<li><code>pyc/context.py</code>: utilities for scope and writing code in memory</li>
<li><code>pyc/codegen.py</code>: for generating C code from a Python AST</li>
<li><code>pyc/__main__.py</code>: the entrypoint</li>
</ol>
<p>
  When I'm writing a new compiler using an existing parser I almost
  always start with the entrypoint and code generator so I can explore
  the AST. However, it's easiest to explain the code if we start with
  the utilities first.
</p><p>We'll also want an empty <code>pyc/__init__.py</code>.</p>
<h3 id="libpyc.c">libpyc.c</h3><p>This C file will contain three helper functions for safely adding,
subtracting, and printing. It will be concatenated to the top of the
generated C file. We'll only support integers for now but this
structure sets us up for supporting more types later on.</p>
<p>We'll use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_Check">PyLong_Check</a>
before calling number-specific methods.</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

inline PyObject* PYC_Add(PyObject* l, PyObject* r) {
  // TODO: allow __add__ override

  // Includes ints and bools
  if (PyLong_Check(l) &amp;&amp; PyLong_Check(r)) {
    return PyNumber_Add(l, r);
  }

  // TODO: handle str, etc.

  // TODO: throw exception
  return NULL;
}

inline PyObject* PYC_Sub(PyObject* l, PyObject* r) {
  // TODO: allow __add__ override

  // Includes ints and bools
  if (PyLong_Check(l) &amp;&amp; PyLong_Check(r)) {
    return PyNumber_Subtract(l, r);
  }

  // TODO: handle str, etc.

  // TODO: throw exception
  return NULL;
}

inline PyObject* PYC_Print(PyObject* o) {
  PyObject_Print(o, stdout, Py_PRINT_RAW);
  printf("\n");
  return Py_None;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! We could generate these as strings in Python but it gets
hairy to do so. By using a dedicated C file, we can take advantage of
syntax highlighting since this file is only C code. And since we've
marked all functions as <code>inline</code>, there's no runtime cost
to using not embedding these as strings in Python.</p>
<h3 id="pyc/context.py">pyc/context.py</h3><p>This file will contain a <code>Context</code> class for managing
identifiers in scope and for proxying to a <code>Writer</code> class
that contains helpers for writing lines of C code.</p>
<p>We'll have two instances of the <code>Writer</code> class in
<code>Context</code> so that we can write to a body (or
current/primary) region and an initialization region.</p>
<p>The initialization region is necessary in case there are any variables
declared at the top-level. We can't initialize these variables in C
outside of a function since every <code>PyObject*</code> must be
created after calling <code>Py_Initialize</code>. This section will be
written into our C <code>main</code> function before we enter a
compiled Python <code>main</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>import copy


class Writer():
    content = ""

    def write(self, exp: str, indent: int = 0):
        self.content += ("  " * indent) + exp

    def writeln(self, stmt: str, indent: int = 0):
        self.write(stmt + "\n", indent)

</code></pre>
<p>This is all pretty boring boilerplate. Let's move on.</p>
<h3 id="pyc/<strong>main</strong>.py">pyc/<strong>main</strong>.py</h3><p>The entrypoint is responsible for reading source code, parsing it,
calling the code generator, writing the source code to a C file, and
compiling it.</p>
<p>First, we read and parse the source code:</p>
<pre><code>import ast
import os
import subprocess
import shutil
import sys

from context import Context
from codegen import generate

BUILTINS = {
    "print": "PYC_Print",
}


def main():
    target = sys.argv[1]
    with open(target) as f:
        source = f.read()
    tree = ast.parse(source, target)
</code></pre>
<p>Then we write <code>libpyc.c</code> into the body, register builtins,
and run code generation:</p>
<pre><code>
...

def main()
    ...

    ctx = Context()
    with open("libpyc.c") as f:
        ctx.body_write(f.read() + "\n")

    for builtin, fn in BUILTINS.items():
        ctx.register_global(builtin, fn)

    generate(ctx, tree)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create a clean output directory and write
<code>main.c</code> with the generated code and a <code>main</code>
function to initialization Python and any global variables:</p>
<pre><code>...

def main():
   ...

    # Create and move to working directory
    outdir = "bin"
    shutil.rmtree(outdir, ignore_errors=True)
    os.mkdir(outdir)
    os.chdir(outdir)

    with open("main.c", "w") as f:
        f.write(ctx.body.content)

        main = ctx.namings.get("main")["name"]
        f.write(f"""int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {{
  Py_Initialize();

  // Initialize globals, if any.
{ctx.initializations.content}
  PyObject* r = {main}();
  return PyLong_AsLong(r);
}}""")
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we run <code>clang-format</code> and <code>gcc</code> against
the generated C code:</p>
<pre><code>...

def main():
    ...

    subprocess.run(["clang-format", "-i", "main.c"])

    cflags_raw = …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <article>
          

<p>Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200809222648/https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/">writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pretty hard, but Google has been at it a while. Let’s see how well Google is doing by asking it for some basic factual information, like the slowest animal.</p>

<p>Google says it’s the three-toed sloth:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-google.png" alt="Google search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>To see just how wrong this is, take a look at this video of a sloth climbing a tree:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNnWhQPQRFQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Can you imagine a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest_organisms#Animals">1 millimeter snail</a> moving this quickly? A sponge? A coral? A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">tardigrade</a>? A 100-micron long mite?</p>

<p>It takes almost no research at all to see that the sloth wouldn’t even be invited to the slowest animal Olympics, let alone win the gold medal.</p>

<p>Google has plenty of company though.</p>

<p>Siri guesses that it’s the <em>two-toed</em> sloth:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-siri.png" alt="Siri search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Bing returns images of sloths, but text saying it’s the seahorse:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-bing.png" alt="Bing search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Cortana returns text saying three-toed sloth while its first image is a Gila monster:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-cortana.png" alt="Cortana search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Although DuckDuckGo doesn’t elevate an editorial snippet, it returns 8 images of sloths and 1 image of a loris:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-duckduckgo.png" alt="DuckDuckGo search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>YouTube’s top hit for animals used to say seahorse, but today says the three-toed sloth:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-youtube.png" alt="YouTube search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>WolframAlpha gets it the closest yet, returning the brown garden snail and explicitly states that it reinterpreted my query as the slowest <em>land</em> animal:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-wolfram-alpha.png" alt="Wolfram Alpha search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>Wikipedia returns an article with slowest animal by phylum and class, including coral with a speed of 0 m/s:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-wikipedia.png" alt="Wikipedia search for slowest animal"></p>

<p>I find it quite interesting that of the 8 websites I asked, the only website that got the answer partially correct was the also the only website that’s a non-profit.</p>

<p><strong>2020 update:</strong> Despite being higher quality than all results returned by search engines, the Wikipedia article was deleted for being too low quality. Alas.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.tedsanders.com/images/the-slowest-animal-wikipedia-deletion.png" alt="Wikipedia deletion notice"></p>

<!--
If you [ask Google for a shirt without stripes](https://github.com/elsamuko/Shirt-without-Stripes), it shows you shirts *with* stripes:

To be fair, 'without' is a pretty tricky word. Amazon and Microsoft fail at this too. -->

<h4>Just another twelve-hundred</h4>
<p>Ok, another day another job 🙂</p>
<p>This time it is Amiga 1200 which is a super cool retro computer sought by a lot of folks nowadays.</p>
<p>Obviously, I’ve bought this unit in a non-working state. It was a bit dirty, with some scratches on the case but as it later turned out, required a bit more work inside 🙂</p>

<h4>Decrunching …</h4>
<p>Disassembly followed quickly. </p>
<p>It slowly started to become obvious that this poor Amiga was heavily corroded.</p>

<h4>Fixing electronics</h4>
<p>In order to progress with this repair, I had to remove all ports, RF modulator, and replace electrolytic capacitors.</p>

<p>Some SMD pads on a PCB didn’t make it because of the corrosion 🙁</p>
<p>I’ve managed to fix that pad with a drop of resin. Once the resin cured, I could gently connect this pad to a trace with a bit of solder.</p>

<p>Finally, I could clean the whole board of dust, flux residue, and other gunk. Below, some pictures after cleaning.</p>

<p>Next, I’ve cleaned all ports with a steel brush on a rotary tool.</p>

<p>I already knew that I will be replacing the RF modulator with the <a href="https://retrohax.net/shop/amiga/amiga-600-and-1200-s-video-adapter/">S-Video module</a>. It outputs way better video than Color Composite and is often a cool alternative if you have a monitor or TV with an S-Video input.</p>
<p>To install it, I usually use two M3 screws. Connecting it fairly straightforward as it takes 5V and GND from RF modulator vias. It also needs LUMA and CHROMA signals from CXA1145.</p>

<p>Fully recapped motherboard S-video mod and ports in place 🙂</p>

<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>Few of the keycaps had broken studs. I’ve gently removed studs that were stuck in plungers and bound them to corresponding keys by inserting a steel wire and used cyano-acrylic glue to hold them in place. </p>

<p>The keyboard membrane was damaged and a lot of pads worn out so I’ve decided to replace it with <a href="https://retrohax.net/shop/amiga/amiga-1200-keyboard-membrane/">a brand new keyboard membrane.</a></p>

<h4>Metal shielding</h4>
<p>I had to get rid of all rust that covered the metal shielding. <a href="https://retrohax.net/extreme-refurbishing-episode-4-vampiric-amiga-500/">I’ve used an electrolytic method that I’ve described already in one of my previous posts.</a> Below a video with rust being removed from A500 shielding.</p>
<figure><p><span><iframe width="900" height="507" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L2h-X8FOv0M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>
<p>It worked like a charm so I’ve spray-painted.</p>

<h4>Case</h4>
<p>Finally, I had to clean all of the rust from a plastic case. To do it, I’ve covered all stains with Phosphoric Acid which nicely binds to Iron Oxide.</p>

<h4>Gotek and putting it all together</h4>
<p>Finally, I was ready to assemble it. I’ve replaced the original 3.5″ floppy drive with a GOTEK interface that was installed on a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2788991">3D printed </a>bracket.</p>

<p>Regular readers have probably noticed my extremely low posting frequency lately. I would usually explain this with some excuse about being busy, but this time, I actually have a good reason behind it. I’ve been spending the past couple of months building a site of my own.</p>
<p>For years, I’ve been frustrated by the state of online discussions, and the platforms that host them. For years, I just sat back and complained, but this time, I thought I should take a stab at it myself, and try to build something better. I’m now proud to say that the site’s version-1 <a href="http://www.thecaucus.net/#/content/my_digest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is now complete</a>!</p>
<p>For those of you wondering why you should visit this site, and what makes it unique, here’s a summary of the guiding principles behind the site. I’m sure you’ll agree that this is indeed an ambitious project, never been attempted before, and I’m very curious to see how it shapes out.</p>

<p>How often have you seen content that is highly rated online, despite being inaccurate, misleading or inflammatory?</p>
<p>How often have you seen an online discussion resembling an echo chamber, with dissenting views being systematically silenced and suppressed?</p>
<p>How often have you seen a great online community crumble because its very success attracts swarms of new members who do not share the community’s values?</p>
<p>These are the problems that caucus was specifically designed to solve. By applying sophisticated Reputation-System based algorithms to rank crowd-sourced content, we aim to develop healthy online communities, and foster truly constructive and thought provoking dialogue.</p>
<h2>Our Principles</h2>
<div id="abouthow">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><em><span>Reputation Matters</span></em></p>
<p>The success of real world communities derives ultimately from reputation, and reputation-enhanced speech. The advice given by the wise is awarded greater reverence and prominence, than that of an angsty troublemaker. The converse of this, in the reputation-free internet, is vitriol and lowest-common-denominator mob rule. We believe that in order to effectively build online communities, and foster constructive discussion, we need digital reputations as well, and reputation-enhanced online speech.</p>
<p><em><span>Discussion Matters</span></em></p>
<p>Constructive discussion keeps the world spinning. Both the spreading of verified knowledge, as well as the discussion and synthesis of new ideas. Announcing to the world that you love Vanilla, is a very safe and popular thing to say. But there has to be more to life than simply discussing how awesome Vanilla is. The most important things in life can also be contentious. And that is exactly why they need to be discussed. Popular content is worth highlighting, but so too is controversial content. Only with a mix of both, can we engage in true dialogue.</p>
<p><em><span>Community Matters</span></em></p>
<p>In our increasingly anonymous online world, communities still matter as much as ever. Systems work best when people are allowed to self-organize into communities. Communities that have their own distinct principles, personalities, values and reputations. Communities composed of regulars, who embody the character of the community itself. Communities that are free to welcome outsiders who are a good cultural fit, and safeguard themselves against outsiders who are not. Communities that socially compete with one another, in order to provide its members with the best experience. And out of this competition, the greatest benefit for individuals: The freedom to pick and choose a community that best reflects her values and needs.</p>

<h2>Site Features</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><em><u>Crowd-sourced Content Ranking</u></em></p>
<p>Through voting, <strong>you</strong> decide which content is worth being on the front page, and which content should be buried in the archives.</p>
<p><em><u>Earned Reputation</u></em></p>
<p>By posting content, and getting votes from others in the community, you can over time, build up your own reputation.</p>
<p><em><u>Reputation Enhanced Speech</u></em></p>
<p>The extent to which content is highlighted will depend on the reputation of the people posting and voting for it. We trust those, who are trusted by their community.</p>
<p><em><u>Fair Airtime</u></em></p>
<p>Some people post every thought that comes into their head, and others are more deliberate about posting things that are well thought out. Some people have an opinion on everything, and others only vote on things that they feel strongly about. We account for such posting/voting patterns to ensure that every person gets a fair voice in the community.</p>
<p><em><u>Merit Based Scoring</u></em></p>
<p>Some content may have accumulated more votes simply because it was posted at a better time, and thus, seen by more people. We normalize for such biases and ensure that every content is judged fairly on its own merit.</p>
<p><em><u>Promoting Controversy</u></em></p>
<p>Popular content has its place, but so too does controversial content. Only with a mix of both, can we engage in true, informative dialogue.</p>
<p><em><u>Community Specific Reputation</u></em></p>
<p>A person’s reputation is specific to each community. Together with reputation-enhanced-speech, this ensures that communities can retain their own unique culture, and not be deluged by outsiders.</p>

                    <p>I’ve been a software engineer a while now and I can say this with confidence - it is fun. It’s great and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. It’s so much fun that some folks try to capture the most enjoyable elements and put them into games.</p>

<p>I’ve played two such games. The first is <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/">Shenzhen.io</a></strong>. This one looks similar to what an engineer working on embedded devices would see. You solve puzzles by writing assembly code on low power devices. What makes this game great is that they remove the annoying parts of writing and shipping code.</p>

<ul>
<li>The requirements are clear, rarely true on the job.</li>
<li>The edit-debug-compile loop is lightning quick. That combined with a great test suite means you can try several potential solutions in a minute.</li>
<li>The platform your code depends on (the game itself) doesn’t have bugs. You don’t need to fix your dependencies before you start on your own code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should a software engineer play Shenzhen.io? The gameplay isn’t for everyone. For some people it feels too much “like work”. At the end of the day you want to relax, not work at tasks that feel similar to what you did for 8 hours. Despite that, I think it’s worthwhile just to see how much more fun a task becomes when the requirements are clear and developer tools are fast. Everyone knows that investing in our direction and our tools will help, but having fun playing this game reinforces that feeling.</p>

<!-- There's a great article about Shenzhen.io that I couldn't quite work in - https://probablydance.com/2016/11/07/lessons-learned-from-shenzhen-io/ -->

<p>The second game is <strong><a href="https://factorio.com/">Factorio</a></strong> which released last Friday, though it has been available as an early access preview for about 4 years now. Those who’ve played it are probably scratching their heads right now - this is a game about building a factory, not coding. You work with conveyor belts, metals, oil products to craft products necessary to make a spacecraft.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqaAjgpsoW8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>And yet, this game reminds me of software engineering more than any other. Let me explain why.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technical debt</strong>. Do we hack it for now or do we implement it right? The answer as always - it depends. Hacking it gets us closer to our goals right now but we have to pay off the debt eventually. Novice players (like me!) start out connecting various parts of our base by conveyor belts till our base resembles spaghetti, similar to poorly maintained codebases. Eventually we learn techniques to tame this complexity so our base/codebase becomes easier to reason about.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</strong>. One of those techniques is reducing duplication. If you have a component that’s needed in multiple places, do you make it once and use it everywhere or do you copy paste in each place it’s needed? The answer is “it depends”. As an engineer, sometimes you use a library while other times you copy paste. It depends on the complexity of the component - a couple of functions can be copy pasted while something complex probably shouldn’t. So it is in Factorio, a certain component (electronic circuits) was being produced in 4-5 places. I eventually replaced them all with one centralised production array to simplify the factory.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling</strong>. A repeated theme in this game is building a production array and later finding we need 3-5x the throughput. The first few times this happens, it requires redoing from scratch. After we wise up, we start design our arrays with space for scaling up. So it is with software - our systems need to scale to many more users, sometimes without much warning. We design our systems keeping that in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Rebuilding</strong>. When we’re rebuilding a component in a single player game or a personal software project we don’t usually care if the component or the whole system stops working briefly. I was playing multiplayer with friends though, so I tried to make sure components I was working on didn’t break anything else. I created a new oil refinery system, shifted existing customers to the new one before decommissioning the old one. Zero downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging</strong> to find root causes. Our factory is far from perfect, so something is always breaking as we add stuff to it. Finding the root causes of these issues is tricky, especially when fixing those leads to other problems, like playing whack-a-mole. An example from yesterday - We don’t have enough electricity, so we add more boilers, but now the water pipes need fixing. Then the water is fine, but we don’t have enough coal. That mirrors real life</li>
<li><strong>Teamwork</strong>. Most things are possible solo given enough time. But it’s quicker and more fun working with a team you like. We were able to move fast by splitting responsibilities among the team. We have one oil guy (me), one trains guy, one secretary of defense, among other roles. The others don’t care about the internals of the refinery system, just the interface - they use the outputs and let me know if it’s broken. It’s the same on large software projects - everyone can’t learn the intricacies of the whole system. Instead everyone learns the APIs of all components while a few are responsible for the implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Researching</strong>. We spend most of our time exploiting our existing knowledge to keep us in our local maxima of output. However, a smart player dedicates some time to learning new techniques. In our game, coal power wasn’t working out for us and I had dismissed nuclear power as an option because we didn’t have enough uranium ore. I looked into it again when we were desperately short of power and producing too much pollution. Turns out even a little ore is enough to power the base for a 100 hours if we do it right. It’s the same with software - our existing stack probably works well, but it’s smart to see what’s out there and possibly learn from others. New team mates can help here too - everything is new to them so they’re spending more time than you on learning. They can come across stuff that we didn’t know about and use that knowledge to find a higher maxima. A fresh pair of eyes is always good.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>. You can do most things manually, it just takes time. But if you’re doing something repeatedly, it should be automated. The game gently eases you towards this idea by requiring a few items be automated. It gets better later in the game you unlock construction robots. You can tell them the layout of the production array you’ve designed, give them the materials and they will construct it for you. This reminded me of AWS CloudFormation and similar tools - although it’s possible to set up servers by hand, it’s quicker and less error prone to specify the end state and let a tool do it for us. But if you’ve developed software, you know that automation isn’t just a means to an end - it’s an end in and of itself. We do it because it makes us happy, even if we do too much of it and <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">forget what we were doing in the first place</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Putting out fires</strong>. Sometimes it’s hard to implement new features because we’re being pulled away to deal with alerts - all too common on software engineering teams. The typical solution is to have one team member deal with alerts while the rest focus on adding features. That’s we did in the game too.</li>
</ul>

<p>But more than any one thing, the game is about managing complexity. Designing a specification and implementing systems that fulfill that specification. Maintaining and growing that system over time.</p>

<p>IMO, playing Factorio will not make you a better software engineer. But if you’re a software engineer, you’ll likely find the game fun. And conversely, if you’re good at the game you should give software engineering a shot.</p>

<p>You can get Factorio at on the <a href="https://factorio.com/">official website</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/">Steam</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://factorio.com/download">free demo</a>, in case you’d like to try before you buy. (Just one thing - don’t wait for a sale. This game has never gone on sale and possibly never will.)</p>

	<p>
		If you're around my age, you'll remember Windows Minesweeper. It was one of several games included with Windows back in the day to try to train users in the use of the then-newfangled â€˜mouseâ€™. It doesnâ€™t come with Windows any more. You can get Minesweeper for Windows 10, but the developers haveâ€¦ made some choices.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you havenâ€™t played it, Minesweeper is a grid of squares, some of which have mines underneath, and your job is to click on all the others. If you click on a mine, you lose. You can also flag squares with the right mouse button to record that you think they are a mine. Your only clue as to where the mines are is that when you click on a square that isnâ€™t a mine, it tells you how many of the eight adjacent squares are mines. If that number is zero, the game automatically clicks on all the adjacent squares for you so you can get a little patch to start from. Hopefully that will include a 1 in a tight corner so thereâ€™s only one place its mine can go, and that will complete a nearby 1 so you can get some more numbers to work from, eventually leading you to complete the game.
	</p>
	<p>
		If youâ€™re not so lucky, you might not get a solvable board. A common situation is that you get down to the last two spaces and you know one of them is a mine but thereâ€™s no wat to predict which one. You have to guess. Heads you win, tails you just wasted 10 minutes carefully clearing the whole board only to be scuppered by a forced guess.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/mines.html">Thereâ€™s a version of Minesweeper that guarantees you never have to guess</a>, which is very nice. It neatly solves the problem of unwinnable games, and while I find that always knowing you can make a deduction can be too big a clue, in regular Minesweeper you could even lose straight off the bat â€” you have to guess the first move and maybe itâ€™ll be a mine. In this case, Windows Minesweeper quietly chooses a different arrangement of mines and pretends like you got lucky after all â€” but it doesnâ€™t do that if youâ€™re stuck at the <em>end</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		So what if we went further? Below is a version of Minesweeper where you will <em>never</em> be penalised when forced to guess. Any time there simply isnâ€™t enough information to deduce a safe move, weâ€™ll pull Windowsâ€™s trick and quietly rearrange the mines so you donâ€™t get penalised.
	</p>
	<p>
		But since that would on its own make the game too easy, the flip side of this coin is that if you <em>can</em> in theory deduce a safe move but guess anyway, the code will quietly rearrange the mines so that your unnecessary risk backfires and you lose.
	</p>
	<p><label>Width </label>
		<label>Height </label>
		<label>Mines </label>
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This game is also rigged to give you a zero on your first click rather than simply a non-mine space. To be honest this is mostly to avoid situations that are computationally difficult â€” this is not what I would call carefully optimised code. If I wanted to expand this I would (eg) make it precalculate things while youâ€™re staring at the screen instead of waiting for you to choose a square and then trying to work out what to do about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		More importantly, I would like to make the game recognise when thereâ€™s a forced guess _coming_ â€” currently if thereâ€™s a 50/50 chance in one corner of the grid that youâ€™re clearly going to have to take eventually, you have to wait until thatâ€™s <em>all</em> there is. If you take the chance when there was a safe space available elsewhere, youâ€™ll always lose.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I was feeling especially mean, I could insist that the player choose the square with the best odds of being safe, rather than simply judging whether or not each square is theoretically knowable. But I think that would be taking things too far.
	</p>

  <div>
    <p>COVID-19 has changed several of my habits. Below, I write about which ones that have changed and a prediction on their permanency.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shopping</strong>: I buy &gt; 90% of my non-perishables online. I never liked in-person shopping and I haven’t had a car for twelve years so this trend was already in motion. When COVID hit, I subscribed to Amazon Prime which is big driver behind this percentage. The bulk of my in person shopping is done at the grocery store for buying produce. I predict this to be a permanent change because of the convenience factor of clicking a button and getting it two days later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fitness</strong>: I live a one minute bike ride away from a 24 Hour Fitness Super Sport Gym. I no longer weight lift and because of that, my muscles have shrunk and I have gained weight. I now run but do not enjoy it as much. I go on atleast one walk everyday—something I never did before. I will go to gyms when they reopen so I can get back to weight lifting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Home</strong>: For my entire adult life, I never invested in a nice home because I never spent time there. Prior to COVID, I’d be out of the house from 10 to 8 because of work and networking events. Now I am home all the time and have bought a desk lamp, a bigger monitor, and rearranged my furniture. I don’t know whether this shift will be permanent because I don’t know what in-person work will look like post COVID.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cooking</strong>: Of my 14 lunch + dinner meals a week, I used to eat out ~10 times. Now, I cook that many times and eat out the rest. It’s been a real joy to try new cuisines, eat healthier, and just be more creative with food. This won’t be a permanent change for me because of time (I spend ~1hr/day cooking) but my cook to eat out ratio will probably settle to an event split when we’re back to normal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>In-person meetings</strong>: I moved to the Bay Area to meet smart people. The bulk of that happened at conferences, bars, and restaurants. I no longer go to any those. This will not be a permanent change because the substitute—virtual gatherings—are not even 25% comparable to an in-person experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Podcasts</strong>: Prior to COVID, I had never listened to a podcast. Now, I cook a lot more and make the 6 hour car drive to my parents house every so often. Podcasts make those long tasks enjoyable. I plan to continue listening because I love the medium - no ads, long format, deep intellectual discussions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> Neuroscientists at EPFL and the University of Edinburgh have discovered that the degree of motivation and the stamina to keep it up depends on the ratio between the neurotransmitters glutamine and glutamate in the nucleus accumbens of the brain.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>There is no question that motivation is one of the hardest and yet important factors in life. It’s the difference between success and failure, goal-setting and aimlessness, well-being and unhappiness. And yet, why is it so hard to get motivated – or even if we do, to keep it up?</p><p>That is the question that scientists led by Professor Carmen Sandi at EPFL and Dr Gedi Luksys at the University of Edinburgh have sought to answer. The researchers worked off previous knowledge that told them two things: First, that people differ a lot in their capacity to engage in motivated behavior and that motivational problems like apathy are common in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Second, to target an area of the brain called the “nucleus accumbens”.</p><p>Sitting close to the bottom of brain, the nucleus accumbens has been the subject of a lot of research. The reason is that it was quickly found to be a major player in functions like aversion, reward, reinforcement, and motivation.</p><p>To test and quantify motivation, the EPFL team designed what is known as a “monetary incentive force task”. The idea is that participants perform a task with increasing – and measurable – effort and get paid sums of money that correspond to their effort. Basically, do more and get paid more.</p><p>In this study, 43 men were scanned to measure–metabolites in the nucleus accumbens in their brains with a sophisticated brain-imaging technique called “proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy”, or <sup>1</sup>H-MRS. This can specifically measure the abundance of neurochemicals in the brain, such as neurotransmitters and metabolites. Because of this <sup>1</sup>H-MRS is used even in clinical settings to determine neurological disorders.</p><p>Subsequently, each participant was asked to squeeze a device that measures force – a dynamometer – to a given level of contraction in order to earn either 0.2, 0.5, or 1 Swiss franc. This procedure was repeated for a number of 120 consecutive trials, which made performance in the task quite demanding.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Du-EkGwPRnA?rel=0" width="640"></iframe></p><p><em>Illustration of the hand-grip force exertion task. In the experiment, participants were first asked to squeeze the grip at their maximal force or capacity. Then, during task performance, in each trial, they had to squeeze it up to a force threshold of 50% of their maximal voluntary contraction and maintained at that force for another 3 seconds in order to earn the particular monetary incentive ascribed to each trial. The task consisted of 80 consecutive trials.

The scientists also ran the experiment under isolation and group conditions to investigate the influence of competition on performance.</p><p>Once they had gathered the behavioral data, the researchers processed it through a computational model that estimated the most appropriate parameters that should be measured with regard to utility, effort, and performance functions. This allowed them to interrogate whether particular neurotransmitter levels predicted specific motivational functions.</p><p>The analysis revealed that the key to performance – and, by extension, motivation – lies within the ratio of two neurotransmitters in the nucleus accumbens: glutamine and glutamate. Specifically, the ratio of glutamine to glutamate relates to our capacity for maintaining performance over a long period of time – what the researchers term “stamina”.</p><p>Another discovery was that competition seems to boost performance even from the beginning of the task. This was especially the case for individuals with low glutamine-to-glutamate ratios in the nucleus accumbens.</p><p>“The findings provide novel insights in the field of motivation neuroscience,” says Carmen Sandi. “They show that the balance between glutamine and glutamate can help predict specific, computational components of motivated performance. Our approach and data can also help us develop therapeutic strategies, including nutritional interventions, that address deficits in effort engagement by targeting metabolism.”</p><p><em>Professor Carmen Sandi’s lab is part of EPFL’s </em><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/bmi/"><em>Brain Mind Institute</em></a><em>, situated in the </em><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv"><em>School of Life Sciences</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Other contributors</strong></p><ul><li>EPFL Center for Biomedical Imaging</li><li>EPFL Laboratory of Functional and Metabolic Imaging</li><li>ICM Institute for Brain and Spinal Cord</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><!-- .entry-header --><div><p>Recently I migrated this website over to WordPress.org. I tried to set it up so I could use my WordPress site with Github Pages. This post details the tribulations I faced while doing so.

I liked this old setup because it was simple and free. I also liked Jekyll’s plain, minimal look. Jekyll’s visual style is very barebones and that’s exactly what I wanted.</p><p>My old workflow for editing and publishing posts was simple. I’d open a text editor, write a post in Markdown, and build and run my website locally to test the changes. Next, I’d push the new post to Github, where I’d re-deploy my website with the changes.</p><p>I first started to get annoyed with this setup when I had to re-remind myself how Jekyll glued together and rendered my site each time I wanted to publish a post. I got even more annoyed when I wanted to make changes to the layout. For example, I tried and failed multiple times to add a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag to the head of my <code>index.html</code> file. This theoretically should have been a very simple change.&nbsp;</p><p>If this happened once or twice, I’d be fine with it. The bigger problem is that the purpose of my website is to encourage me to write more. I started to procrastinate writing because there was always some small thing I wanted to fix with Jekyll first. Then, when I made time to tinker around with Jekyll, I was annoyed that I spent more time doing that than actually writing.</p><h2 id="requirements"><strong>Requirements for a new solution</strong></h2><p>So, I decided to make it was time to change my setup. My new setup had to fulfill just two requirements:</p><ol><li><strong>Easy content management. </strong>I really like the idea of just writing something, editing it, and then hitting a button to publish it once it’s ready. I didn’t like diving into Ruby files just to fix configuration issues, deploy issues, UI issues, etc. (what was happening with Jekyll).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be a writing first experience. </strong>I’ve never quite liked writing in text editors. Something about it just doesn’t <em>feel</em> right, though I can’t put my finger on exactly what.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I decided to go with WordPress because it seemed like it fulfilled both of those requirements really well. Also <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> is free, unlike Webflow and Ghost, two alternatives I considered that are both quite pricey ($20/month for Webflow and $29/month for Ghost) and loaded with a bunch of features I don’t need yet.</p><h2 id="mistakes"><strong>Two big initial mistakes</strong></h2><p>As mentioned above, previously I used Github/Github Pages to host and serve my website. Github was free and worked great, so I wanted to rig up my WordPress setup to also use Github and Github Pages.&nbsp;</p><p>The only requirement to use Github Pages is that your site has to be static. Some light Googling showed me that there were a few plugins that converted WordPress site files to static pages. There were even <a href="https://www.hywel.me/static/site/wordpress/2016/07/17/fast-free-static-website-with-wordpress-and-github-pages.html">a few tutorials</a> describing how to do this, so I was confident this would be possible. That was my first big mistake.</p><p>Next, I began figuring out how to get WordPress to run locally. That was my second big mistake. My logic here was simple. Previously with Jekyll, I’d run my website locally, add my changes, and then push the new version of my website to Github to redeploy it. Thus, if I wanted to use WordPress with Github and Github Pages, then I should run my WordPress site locally, add my changes, and then push the new version of the site to Github.&nbsp;</p><p>While this logic wasn’t bad, I really should have tested the core assumption that it relied on first (the fact that the WordPress site <em>could</em> be converted into a static website). Or I should have done a bit more research than just some “light Googling” before venturing into a solution and stubbornly refusing to give up.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="warning"><strong>A warning (because hindsight is 20/20)</strong></h2><p>Here’s what I know now: running WordPress locally is a nightmare. Successfully figuring it out was way harder than it should have been. If you’re trying to do this yourself, don’t. You most likely don’t need to, and there’s probably another solution you can use to get to what you want.&nbsp;</p><p>(I should also caveat that I know almost nothing about Apache, MySQL, FTP, and PHP. If you’re familiar with them, then you might not have the same issues. However, I really don’t think I should have needed to learn about all of those technologies just to set up WordPress locally.)</p><h2 id="run-locally"><strong>The treacherous journey to run WordPress locally</strong></h2><p>First, I downloaded WordPress.org and installed it locally. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/installing-wordpress-on-your-own-computer/">official WordPress installation page</a> implied that I also needed some combination of Apache, MySQL, and PHP. A few of the links on that page were broken, a red flag that I promptly ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>I read a few other tutorials and subsequently downloaded and installed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/">XAMPP</a>, making sure to include Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin in the installation. I opened up XAMPP and pressed the “Start Application” button. That took me to an error page.</p><p>I clicked through some XAMPP tabs and pressed a few more buttons that started Apache, MySQL, and ProFTD. Now pressing “Start Application” took me to an XAMPP page. This seemed promising, but I still got an error page when trying to access my WordPress site which should have been running locally.</p><p>I bopped around a bit more and figured out that I had to enable local forwarding in XAMPP on an available port. I roll my eyes and question why XAMPP is so difficult to use.</p><p>Now that I could <em>see</em> my WordPress site locally, I still couldn’t do anything (e.g. create post). I learned that I needed to create a database locally via phpMyAdmin. Again, this is something that should have been easy, but the interface SUCKED. I had such difficulty performing such a simple action. I mean…just look at it:&nbsp;</p><figure><img width="1024" height="544" src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png" alt="phpMyAdmin home screen" srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png 1024w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-300x159.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-768x408.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1536x817.png 1536w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-2048x1089.png 2048w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-600x319.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png" data-srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png 1024w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-300x159.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-768x408.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1536x817.png 1536w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-2048x1089.png 2048w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-600x319.png 600w"><figcaption><em>phpMyAdmin home screen</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img width="1022" height="486" src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png" alt="bad database creation UI" srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png 1022w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-300x143.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-768x365.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-600x285.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png" data-srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png 1022w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-300x143.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-768x365.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-600x285.png 600w"><figcaption><em>phpMyAdmin “Create Database” page</em></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at these screenshots now makes me annoyed all over again.</p><h2 id="annoying-issues"><strong>More annoying issues I faced</strong></h2><p>I then ran into some issues that took me a long time to figure out. Surprisingly, there was not a lot of advice out there on good solutions. I spent more time than I’d like to admit on WordPress support forums and arcane blogs. I’ll include the two most annoying issues here for posterity and in the event that another poor soul is also sifting through Google searching for a solution.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Annoying error #1: “to perform the requested action WordPress needs to access your web server”</em></strong></p><p>To fix this, add <code>define( 'FS_METHOD', 'direct' );</code> to your <code>wp-config.php</code> file.</p><p><strong><em>Annoying error #2: fix the file and folder permissions error in WordPress / “installation failed could not create directory”</em></strong></p><p>To fix this, you need to give XAMPP write access to the local directory you have WordPress set up in. I spent awhile messing around with quite a few config files (like .htaccess) and FTP permission codes to no avail. The solution was ultimately simple: right-click on your local WordPress directory, click “Get Info”, scroll to “Sharing &amp; Permissions”, and change the permissions on your directory to “Read and Write (anyone)”.</p><h2 id="is-it-working"><strong>Finally, it’s working?</strong></h2><p>At long last, all of this is finally working and I now have WordPress running locally.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, the next step is to install a plugin to convert my site into a bunch of static pages. I go with <a href="https://www.simplystatic.co/">SimplyStatic</a>, the most popular and highly recommended plugin to do this.</p><p>I immediately run into quite a few errors with SimplyStatic. After progressively resolving each one, I ultimately run into one I can’t fix. I search some more and realize that it’s because SimplyStatic was only compatible with an earlier version of WordPress than the one I was running. I dig further and realize that the plugin hasn’t been updated for over two years. And there don’t seem to be <em>any</em> currently updated plugins that do this conversion. Epic FAIL.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn’t want to sink in even more time to learn how to convert the WordPress PHP files into static pages. I decided to cut my losses right there and abandon ship.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="conclusion"><strong>The Conclusion</strong></h2><p><strong><span>TL;DR? Don’t try to run WordPress locally, and don’t try to use WordPress with Github Pages to host and serve it. It won’t work.</span></strong></p><p>I ultimately ended up going with <a href="http://siteground.com/">Siteground</a> for managed hosting. Siteground’s interface is awful, but after poking around a bit I got most of it set up. I had a few minor configuration issues when enabling HTTPS and spent ~30 minutes chatting with a customer support agent, who was actually quite helpful.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="postscript"><strong>Postscript: I’m never satisfied and here are a few more things about WordPress that I’m annoyed with</strong></h2><ol><li>Unless you want your WordPress site to look bad or just like everyone else’s, you’ll probably want to customize an existing theme to your own liking. <strong>To do this, you’ll still need to hack around with code<em> </em></strong><em>(in this case, a combination of HTML, CSS and PHP)</em>. Theoretically, you could probably install a plugin to help you do this, but that’d probably slow down your site and further obscure how things actually work.&nbsp;</li><li>Getting used to WordPress itself was a bit of a curve. The main dashboard, for instance, is completely useless to me. I’ve just been ignoring all parts of the interface I don’t need, which thus far has been working pretty well.&nbsp;</li></ol><hr><p>If you liked this post, add your email address below to stay updated whenever there’s a new one.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

	
				<p>Have you ever had wrist-pain from using a mouse all day? I have. And recently it got a lot worse.</p>
<p>A while ago, my employer had sent me a shiny iMac to work from home.&nbsp;For security reasons, they&nbsp;required that I use it for work. Unfortunately for my wrist, this also meant that I would be stuck at a desk, whereby my hand and wrist would be in the same unnatural position&nbsp;for 40 hours a week. Gone&nbsp;were&nbsp;the days that I could freestyle around my room with my laptop, switching between my desk and my bed.</p>
<p>Within weeks, my wrist started to hurt. I was in pain every day. So I bought a vertical mouse.</p>
<p><a href="http://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-bluetooth-mouse.jpg"><img src="http://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-bluetooth-mouse-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-bluetooth-mouse-225x300.jpg 225w, https://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-bluetooth-mouse-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"><br>
</a><span id="more-3989"></span></p>
<p><strong>Evoluent<br>
</strong>The folks at Evoluent have been making ergonomic mice since 1994. Their <a href="https://evoluent.com/" target="_blank">websites</a> is ugly as hell, and their branding is terrible. Yet they charge about $110 for a mouse. I had never tried an ergonomic mouse before, and I was afraid it would take me months to get used to it. But&nbsp;I desperately needed one, as I was in pain every day.&nbsp;I wanted to buy a product that had already&nbsp;withstood the test of time.</p>
<p>I looked for second hand ones, and I found one that fit my requirements. It was the&nbsp;<em>Evoluent VerticalMouse 4 Bluetooth</em>.&nbsp;I haggled the price down to $40 shipped! I figured I could easily resell it for more if I didn’t like it.</p>
<p>The upside of being a Middle Easterner is that you learn to negotiate everything from a young age. My mom even negotiates on prices in the supermarket, and she often wins. Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth vs USB mini receiver<br>
</strong>When it comes to wireless mice, Bluetooth is superior to mice that&nbsp;rely on radio-frequency USB mini receivers, as&nbsp;they often&nbsp;have interference, causing your mouse to lag, shake up or briefly loose connection. I’ve experienced this a lot, even with expensive Logitech mice. Perhaps my desk is too messy or has too many peripherals on it. And with Bluetooth, you don’t need to take out the USB receiver when switching to another computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-vertical-mouse-wireless.jpg"><img src="http://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-vertical-mouse-wireless-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-vertical-mouse-wireless-300x225.jpg 300w, https://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-vertical-mouse-wireless-768x576.jpg 768w, https://eftegarie.com/wp-content/uploads/evoluent-ergonomic-vertical-mouse-wireless-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p><strong>Verdict<br>
</strong>Now let’s get to the point: As soon as I first used the mouse, I was relieved to find out how easy it was to use. I was able to control the pointer just as good as my normal mouse, right from the get-go. Phew, my biggest fear was gone! Note that during my research, I read online that some people took weeks or even months to get used to it, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>As of now, I’ve been using it for about a week, so I cannot comment on the battery life. But overall I am satisfied with this mouse. And most importantly; my wrist pain is gone completely. From daily pain to no paint at all.</p>
<p>I will cherish this mouse for as long as I can.</p>
<p>P.S.<br>
Evoluent has been neglectful of their brand and their product for years now. Their drivers are incompatible with modern Mac computers. Their website and product photography is ugly. There are barely any YouTubers reviewing their products. They are leaving a hole open in the market.</p>
<p>Someone should create a much better experience. There’s a tiny company here that I wish existed. I can summarize&nbsp;the business plan in one sentence:&nbsp;<em>“An ergonomic mouse that looks like it was designed and branded by Steve Jobs, for roughly half the price of an Evoluent”.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>So if anyone wants to explore this further with me, feel free to&nbsp;<a href="https://eftegarie.com/contact">contact me</a>. I have experience in designing physical products, branding and manufacturing.</p><p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Most WebAssembly tutorials and examples you will find online focus on using it inside the browser in order to accelerate various functionality of a website or web app.<br>
However, there is an area where WebAssembly is really powerful but not talked too much about: outside the browser usage scenarios. That is what we’ll focus on in this series of posts.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-webassembly">What is WebAssembly?</h2>
<p>Web people are on a roll of giving bad names to things (web-gpu is another example).<br>
WebAssembly is neither web or assembly, but a bytecode that can be targeted from languages like C++, C#, Rust and others. This means you can write some Rust code, compile it into WebAssembly and run that code in a WebAssembly virtual machine.</p>

<p>This is powerful because you won’t have to deal with garbage collected scripted languages anymore, and essentially use Rust or C++ as your <em>scripting language</em>.  WebAssembly enables predictable and stable performance because it doesn’t require garbage collection like the usual options (LUA/JavaScript).</p>

<p>It’s a relatively new product and there are a lot of rough edges, especially for out-of-browser scenarios. One of the roughest ones in my experience has been documentation for out-of-browser scenarios and this is the reason for my blog posts, to document my findings and hopefully help some people that may be interested in this subject.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-we-want-to-run-webassembly-outside-of-a-browser">Why would we want to run WebAssembly outside of a browser?</h2>
<p>For out of browser scenarios, one of its main advantage is that it provides system level access without compromising on security. This is done through WASI, the Web Assembly System Interface. <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a> is a collection of C-like functions that provide access to functionality such as <code>fd_read</code>, <code>rand</code>, <code>fd_write</code>, threads (WIP), in a safe way.</p>

<p>Here are a few scenarios where you would be able to use web-assembly outside of a browser:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A scripting language for a video game.</li>
  <li>To run some code with minimal overhead as Fastly/Cloudflare are doing with their compute-at-edge scenarios.</li>
  <li>To run some easy to update code on IoT devices safely and with minimal runtime overhead.</li>
  <li>Extreamly fast programs in environments where you can’t JIT for <em>reasons</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>For the best experience in this adventure, I suggest using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as your IDE and install the following extensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>rust-analyzer</code>: for autocomplete and other great features.</li>
  <li><code>Code-LLDB</code>: For debugging with LLDB (even works on Windows)</li>
  <li><code>WebAssembly by the WebAssembly foundation</code>: Allows you to disassemble and inspect <code>.wasm</code> binaries.</li>
</ul>


<p>First you need a Virtual Machine (VM) that can run your WebAssembly program. This VM needs to be embeddable, so you can add it in your game engine, or what we will call from now on <strong>host program</strong>. There are a few to pick from: <a href="https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3">WASM3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime">WAMR</a>, and many others. They have various characteristics, such as supporting JIT, using as little memory as possible and so on and you have to choose one one that fits your target platform and scenario.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter too much what VM you’re choosing besides runtime properties, with the exception of debugging. The only VM that allows for a seamless debugging experience that I’ve found is Wasmtime (this is another one of those rough edges). So even if you don’t plan on deploying that anywhere due to other constraints, I suggest using it as the <strong>debug VM</strong>. Whenever you’d want to debug some WASM code you can launch it with Wasmtime.</p>



<p>First, we need to create a new <code>lib</code> project:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>cargo new <span>--lib</span> wasm_example
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In <code>Cargo.toml</code> add the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can edit <code>lib.rs</code> and export the following <code>C</code> FFI compatible function from it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[no_mangle]</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"From WASM: Sum is: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
    <span>s</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This a function that takes two numbers, adds them, then prints the result before returning their sum.<br>
WebAssembly doesn’t define a default function that’s executed after a module is loaded, so in the host program you need to get a function by it’s signature, and run it (quite similar to how <code>dlopen</code>/<code>dlsym</code> works).</p>

<p>We expose this <code>sum</code> function (and any other functions we want to call from the host VM) as a function that’s callable from <code>C</code>, using <code>[#no_mangle]</code> and <code>pub extern "C"</code>. If you’re coming here from some WASM for the browser tutorials, you may notice we don’t need to use <code>wasm-bindgen</code> at all.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-compile-it">How do we compile it?</h2>
<p>Rust supports two targets for WebAssembly: <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> and <code>wasm32-wasi</code>. The first one is bare-bones WebAssembly. Think of it like the <code>[#no-std]</code> of WebAssembly. It’s the kind you’d use for the browser that doesn’t assume any system functions are available.</p>

<p>At the other end, <code>wasm32-wasi</code> assumes that the VM exposes the <code>WASI</code> functionality, allowing a different implementation of the standard library to be used (the implementation that depends on the WASI functions to be available).</p>

<p>You can take a look at the available implementations for the Rust’s stdlib here: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys</a>  <br>
This is the implementation that assumes WASI functions are available to the rust program when running in a WebAssembly VM: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys/wasi">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys/wasi</a>.</p>

<p>To comile for wasm32-wasi run:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Run this just once</span>
rustup target add wasm32-wasi

<span># Compile for the wasm32-wasi target.</span>
cargo build <span>--target</span> wasm32-wasi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="but-how-does-println-work">But how does <code>println!()</code> work?</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that we’re calling <code>println!()</code> and expecting the program to work and print to the console, but how does a WebAssembly program knows how to do that?</p>

<p>This is why we’re using <code>wasm32-wasi</code>. This target selects for the rust stdlib the version that assumes some functionality to be there (the <code>WASI</code> functions). Printing to the console means just writing to a special file descriptor. Most VMs allow that by default so we don’t need to do any special settings, besides compiling the correct <code>wasm32-wasi</code> target.</p>

<p>If you have installed the required extensions for vscode, you can now right click on <code>target/wasm32-wasi/debug/wasm_example.wasm</code> and select <code>Show WebAssembly</code> and you should have a new file open in vscode that looks like this:</p>

<p>This is a <code>wat</code> file. <code>wat</code> stands for WebAssembly text format. It’s kind of like looking at x64/ARM ASM instructions when disassembling a binary, just uglier and harder to understand. I have read that this was because the creators of WebAssembly couldn’t decide on a text format so they just left it in this ugly s-expression form.</p>

<p>The import statements here tell us that the WASM program needs the following functions <code>proc_exit</code>, <code>fd_write</code>, <code>environ_get</code>, <code>environ_sizes_get</code> to exist in the <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> namespace.<br>
All imported or exported functions from a WebAssembly module require a namespace. <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> is the WASI namespace so you can think of it as a reserved namespace for these functions. <code>println!</code> needs <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1::fd_write</code> to write to stdout.</p>

<h2 id="the-host-program">The host program</h2>
<p>You can pick any VM that has WASI available. I will use Wasmtime because later on I want to show you how to debug WebAssembly and this VM is the only one where debugging works at the moment.</p>

<p>The program loads the wasm binary file from the path: <code>examples/wasm_example.wasm</code>.<br>
This is the file you have previously compiled that you can find in <code>wasm_example/target/wasm32-wasi/debug/wasm_example.wasm</code>. <strong>Make sure you move it in the right place before running the host program.</strong></p>

<p>Here is the full listing of the host VM rust program that initializes the Wasmtime VM, loads the module, links against WASI and loads and executes the exported <code>sum</code> function from the WASM module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>error</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>;</span>

<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>This paper is an attempt to explain all the matrix calculus you need in order to understand the training of deep neural networks. We assume no math knowledge beyond what you learned in calculus 1, and provide links to help you refresh the necessary math where needed. Note that you do <b>not</b> need to understand this material before you start learning to train and use deep learning in practice; rather, this material is for those who are already familiar with the basics of neural networks, and wish to deepen their understanding of the underlying math. Don't worry if you get stuck at some point along the way---just go back and reread the previous section, and try writing down and working through some examples. And if you're still stuck, we're happy to answer your questions in the <a href="http://forums.fast.ai/c/theory">Theory category at forums.fast.ai</a>. <b>Note</b>: There is a <a href="#reference">reference section</a> at the end of the paper summarizing all the key matrix calculus rules and terminology discussed here.</p>






<h2 id="intro">Introduction </h2>


<p>Most of us last saw calculus in school, but derivatives are a critical part of machine learning, particularly deep neural networks, which are trained by optimizing a loss function. Pick up a machine learning paper or the documentation of a library such as <a href="http://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> and calculus comes screeching back into your life like distant relatives around the holidays.  And it's not just any old scalar calculus that pops up---you need differential <i>matrix calculus</i>, the shotgun wedding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">linear algebra</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus">multivariate calculus</a>. </p>

<p>Well... maybe <i>need</i> isn't the right word; Jeremy's courses show how to become a world-class deep learning practitioner with only a minimal level of scalar calculus, thanks to leveraging the automatic differentiation built in to modern deep learning libraries. But if you really want to really understand what's going on under the hood of these libraries, and grok academic papers discussing the latest advances in model training techniques, you'll need to understand certain bits of the field of matrix calculus.</p>

<p>For example, the activation of a single computation unit in a neural network is typically calculated using the dot product (from linear algebra) of an edge weight vector <span>w</span> with an input vector <span>x</span> plus a scalar bias (threshold): <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-EEDCFA4252D0992243A283CE0EB777A6-depth003.31.svg">. Function <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-C599D931407509E0FA08F8686B205B6D-depth003.25.svg"> is called the unit's <i>affine function</i> and is followed by a <a href="https://goo.gl/7BXceK">rectified linear unit</a>, which clips negative values to zero: <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-66258AA93A4746DA10D306190271DE4B-depth003.25.svg">. Such a computational unit is sometimes referred to as an “artificial neuron” and looks like:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/neuron.png" alt="neuron.png" width="250"></p>
</center>

<p>Neural networks consist of many of these units, organized into multiple collections of neurons called <i>layers</i>. The activation of one layer's units become the input to the next layer's units. The activation of the unit or units in the final layer is called the network output.</p>

<p><i>Training</i> this neuron means choosing weights <span>w</span> and bias <span>b</span> so that we get the desired output for all <span>N</span> inputs <span>x</span>.  To do that, we minimize a <i>loss function</i> that compares the network's final <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-7971D42A6C6C6A28D6443F0645E4A036-depth003.25.svg"> with the <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-E146B831A1E53B95E4C63775285D62CF-depth003.25.svg"> (desired output of <span>x</span>) for all input <span>x</span> vectors. To minimize the loss, we use some variation on gradient descent, such as plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">stochastic gradient descent</a> (SGD), SGD with momentum, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Adam">Adam</a>.   All of those require the partial derivative (the gradient) of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-7971D42A6C6C6A28D6443F0645E4A036-depth003.25.svg"> with respect to the model parameters <span>w</span> and <span>b</span>. Our goal is to gradually tweak <span>w</span> and <span>b</span> so that the overall loss function keeps getting smaller across all <span>x</span> inputs.</p>

<p>If we're careful, we can derive the gradient by differentiating the scalar version of a common loss function (mean squared error):</p>
<p><img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/blkeqn-A129949CD1EF7BE2CA8BD424D34F9930.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>But this is just one neuron, and neural networks must train the weights and biases of all neurons in all layers simultaneously.  Because there are multiple inputs and (potentially) multiple network outputs, we really need general rules for the derivative of a function with respect to a vector and even rules for the derivative of a vector-valued function with respect to a vector.</p>

<p>This article walks through the derivation of some important rules for computing partial derivatives with respect to vectors, particularly those useful for training neural networks. This field is known as <i>matrix calculus</i>, and the good news is, we only need a small subset of that field, which we introduce here.  While there is a lot of online material on multivariate calculus and linear algebra, they are typically taught as two separate undergraduate courses so most material treats them in isolation.  The pages that do discuss matrix calculus often are really just lists of rules with minimal explanation or are just pieces of the story. They also tend to be quite obscure to all but a narrow audience of mathematicians, thanks to their use of dense notation and minimal discussion of foundational concepts. (See the annotated list of resources at the end.)</p>

<p>In contrast, we're going to rederive and rediscover some key matrix calculus rules in an effort to explain them. It turns out that matrix calculus is really not that hard! There aren't dozens of new rules to learn; just a couple of key concepts.  Our hope is that this short paper will get you started quickly in the world of matrix calculus as it relates to training neural networks. We're assuming you're already familiar with the basics of neural network architecture and training. If you're not, head over to <a href="http://course.fast.ai/">Jeremy's course</a> and complete part 1 of that, then we'll see you back here when you're done. (Note that, unlike many more academic approaches, we strongly suggest <i>first</i> learning to train and use neural networks in practice and <i>then</i> study the underlying math. The math will be much more understandable with the context in place; besides, it's not necessary to grok all this calculus to become an effective practitioner.)</p>

<p><i>A note on notation</i>: Jeremy's course exclusively uses code, instead of math notation, to explain concepts since unfamiliar functions in code are easy to search for and experiment with. In this paper, we do the opposite: there is a lot of math notation because one of the goals of this paper is to help you understand the notation that you'll see in deep learning papers and books. At the <a href="#notation">end of the paper</a>, you'll find a brief table of the notation used, including a word or phrase you can use to search for more details.</p>

<p>There are other rules for trigonometry, exponentials, etc., which you can find at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus">Khan Academy differential calculus course</a>.</p>

<p>When a function has a single parameter, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-50BBD36E1FD2333108437A2CA378BE62-depth003.25.svg">, you'll often see <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-6BDA8AF54C40BC23ED858E9E9F5C11D2-depth002.72.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-74CAF4D1EC90D3A36EA7C7BBFE65B516-depth003.25.svg"> used as shorthands for <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-5BA9D16419154B1BDBECA39D99E8E809-depth004.58.svg">. We recommend against this notation as it does not make clear the variable we're taking the derivative with respect to. </p>

<p>You can think of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg"> as an operator that maps a function of one parameter to another function.  That means that <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-EC0CEC5F9488EC510F8D688E7003222D-depth004.58.svg"> maps <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-50BBD36E1FD2333108437A2CA378BE62-depth003.25.svg"> to its derivative with respect to <span>x</span>, which is the same thing as <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-07A5EA519C4CEA1A3539E3A7FC289163-depth004.58.svg">. Also, if <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-FD91C508F91C2C84498680BD337C1D7A-depth003.25.svg">, then <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-B1ED3CF9BA4D6F25A5A4F481C45EC658-depth004.58.svg">. Thinking of the derivative as an operator helps to simplify complicated derivatives because the operator is distributive and lets us pull out constants. For example, in the following equation, we can pull out the constant 9 and distribute the derivative operator across the elements within the parentheses.</p>
<p><img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/blkeqn-A1EC7F214318E08949CC8BFCED138D94.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>That procedure reduced the derivative of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-FDFD125C741CD062B2CA779DDE0524BE-depth003.25.svg"> to a bit of arithmetic and the derivatives of <span>x</span> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-32F5240D0DBF2CCBE75EF7F8EF2015E0-depth000.14.svg">, which are much easier to solve than the original derivative.</p>


<h2 id="sec3">Introduction to vector calculus and partial derivatives</h2>


<p>Neural network layers are not single functions of a single parameter, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-50BBD36E1FD2333108437A2CA378BE62-depth003.25.svg">. So, let's move on to functions of multiple parameters such as <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-3BAF1600AE50930A155F58AE172B51BD-depth003.25.svg">. For example, what is the derivative of <span>xy</span> (i.e., the multiplication of <span>x</span> and <span>y</span>)? In other words, how does the product <span>xy</span> change when we wiggle the variables? Well, it depends on whether we are changing <span>x</span> or <span>y</span>.  We compute derivatives with respect to one variable (parameter) at a time, giving us two different <i>partial derivatives</i> for this two-parameter function (one for <span>x</span> and one for <span>y</span>).  Instead of using operator <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg">, the partial derivative operator is  <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-4D6C379F66675645B3FFE28A15306857-depth004.67.svg"> (a stylized <span>d</span> and not the Greek letter <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-77A3B715842B45E440A5BEE15357AD29-depth000.22.svg">). So, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-08DCCFBE629A14FCCD9FB9A20F2E367C-depth004.67.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-1FDCF7A9F137AE48FA25EE34A69F8201-depth006.34.svg"> are the partial derivatives of <span>xy</span>; often, these are just called the <i>partials</i>.  For functions of a single parameter, operator <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-4D6C379F66675645B3FFE28A15306857-depth004.67.svg"> is equivalent to <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg"> (for sufficiently smooth functions). However, it's better to use <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-624FEBB9A49A3FC96353C861D175C806-depth004.58.svg"> to make it clear you're referring to a scalar derivative.</p>

<p>The partial derivative with respect to <span>x</span> is just the usual scalar derivative, simply treating any other variable in the equation as a constant.  Consider function <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-D6DEAE7E403381C2C425D4B40CCA936E-depth003.25.svg">. The partial derivative with respect to <span>x</span> is written <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-F063B8EC812DF3D204F9327F5D094073-depth004.67.svg">. There are three constants from the perspective of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-4D6C379F66675645B3FFE28A15306857-depth004.67.svg">: 3, 2, and <span>y</span>. Therefore, <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-D981BA4BD14AC44C43A4E4E0EC750B4A-depth004.67.svg">. The partial derivative with respect to <span>y</span> treats <span>x</span> like a constant: <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-55A3A400FAD3326FEF1BB9DDD2658383-depth006.34.svg">.  It's a good idea to derive these yourself before continuing otherwise the rest of the article won't make sense.  Here's the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/partial-derivative-and-gradient-articles/a/introduction-to-partial-derivatives">Khan Academy video on partials</a> if you need help.</p>

<p>To make it clear we are doing vector calculus and not just multivariate calculus, let's consider what we do with the partial derivatives <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-84D799755A7F73945BD58B2E057121AB-depth004.67.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-A2DE2EC029172B84A0A0E8A8D00F5A6F-depth006.34.svg"> (another way to say <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-75645E70B6C95F7466C353E9C2306FE0-depth004.67.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-B20FF70C037320C2D0B710F4B592927E-depth006.34.svg">) that we computed for <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-D6DEAE7E403381C2C425D4B40CCA936E-depth003.25.svg">.  Instead of having them just floating around and not organized in any way, let's organize them into a horizontal vector. We call this vector the <i>gradient</i> of <img src="https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/images/eqn-3BAF1600AE50930A155F58AE172B51BD-depth003.25.svg"> and …</p></div>

		<p>Dear New Developer,</p>
<p>Congratulations! Let’s take a moment to celebrate the decision you’ve made to launch or redirect your career. What lies ahead is a lot of hard work, satisfaction, the occasional desire to throw your laptop out a window, and a ton of learning. That’s true of most professions, so you’re also in good company.</p>
<p>As a developer, you will solve a thousand puzzles, and then a thousand more. Your brain will stretch and grow. You will dream about databases or pixels or curly braces. I once had a dream where I was walking down a hallway, but the hallway <em>was my code</em>. It was a good dream. I found a bug.</p>
<p>Greg LeMond, a pro cyclist and three-time Tour de France winner, once said something about cycling that I want to share with you: <img data-attachment-id="6422" data-permalink="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/04/27/it-never-gets-easier-you-just-go-faster/lemond/" data-orig-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png" data-orig-size="355,239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lemond" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=355" src="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=1100" alt="lemond" srcset="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png 355w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=150 150w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></p>
<p>“It never gets easier, you just go faster.”</p>
<p>In so many ways, that describes a career in software. The puzzles you struggle with today will be easy in a month or a year. You’ll learn new patterns and best practices. Then you’ll take on new, harder challenges. You’ll struggle with those and learn and grow. Then you’ll start the cycle (pun intended) all over again.</p>
<p>Something I’ll add, though, is that you’ll be able to approach later challenges with more experience and confidence. What we bring to our jobs is an accumulation of skills and experience. This isn’t linear. It sometimes goes smoothly, sometimes it’s faster than we imagine possible. Then there are stretches where it feels like we’re clambering around in the dark.</p>
<p>For instance, I was once asked to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP</a> application (think super early mobile apps before smart phones existed). I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and I was mostly left alone on the project. I started by drawing some screens, took a deep breath, and started building. It was really tough going, but so many lessons have stuck with me from that experience. My skills at breaking down challenges and approaching them bit by bit really improved. I became comfortable throwing away code because the first code I wrote was atrocious. Plus, the project was eventually canceled, which was entirely the right business decision. Through that, I learned about evaluating tradeoffs in terms of business value—my time was better spent on higher priority projects.</p>
<p>In my current adventure, nearly 20 years later, I’m once again writing a mobile app and applying all of those lessons. Picking up languages and frameworks that I haven’t used before is far less daunting. Ensuring that I’m working on the most important thing is a constant recalibration, but one that is comfortable now. Working through stumbling blocks one at a time and having patterns for getting through them is second nature.</p>
<p>Just like learning isn’t linear, neither are careers. Your path will be your own. What you are doing today may or may not be what you’re doing in ten years. You might go into any number of other areas in software, or stay the course as a developer. It’s your life and all those choices are equally valid. One of my former colleagues quit to make hand-built microphones; another makes goat cheese in the Catalan Pyrenees. My personal philosophy is that at each opportunity to make a career decision, you should pick the direction that interests you most. Just like you learn faster when you are interested in your subject, you will ship better software (or make better cheese) when you are interested in your job.</p>
<p>There’s much more I’d love to tell you, but this letter is growing long. I’ll add some concise tidbits before I end.</p>
<ul>
<li>You belong here. Try not to doubt that.</li>
<li>Get really good at debugging. It’s a skill and you will need it.</li>
<li>If you don’t respect your boss, or if they don’t respect you back, go find a new one.</li>
<li>Learning is part of your job. Make time for it.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to put your code in production.</li>
<li>Be a good team member. You will accomplish more and learn faster.</li>
<li>Ask lots of questions. Someone else probably wants to hear the answer.</li>
<li>And finally, have fun! You’ve got this!</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish you all the luck in the world!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rebecca Campbell</p>

<p id="b9a9">Natural Language Processing (NLP) per Wikipedia:</p>
<p id="34cf">“Is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.”</p>
<p id="7dd8">The field has seen tremendous advances during the recent explosion of progress in machine learning techniques.</p>
<p id="b5f8">Here are some of its more impressive recent achievements:</p>
<p id="cb15"><strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;The Winograd Schema is a test of common sense reasoning- easy for humans, but historically almost impossible for computers- which requires the test taker to indicate which noun an ambiguous pronoun stands for. The correct answer hinges on a single word, which is different between two separate versions of the question. For example:</p>
<p id="512d"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.</em></p>
<p id="ece3"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.</em></p>
<p id="0ddf">Who does the pronoun “They” refer to in each of the instances?</p>
<p id="d33c">The Winograd schema test was originally intended to be a more rigorous replacement for the Turing test, because it seems to require deep knowledge of how things fit together in the world, and the ability to reason about that knowledge in a linguistic context. Recent advances in NLP have allowed computers to achieve near human scores:(<a href="https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/</a>).</p>
<p id="0a43"><strong>B)</strong>&nbsp;The New York Regent’s science exam is a test requiring both scientific knowledge and reasoning skills, covering an extremely broad range of topics. Some of the questions include:</p>
<p id="a36d"><em>1.Which equipment will best separate a mixture of iron filings and black pepper? (1) magnet (2) filter paper (3) triplebeam balance (4) voltmeter</em></p>
<p id="9797"><em>2. Which form of energy is produced when a rubber band vibrates? (1) chemical (2) light (3) electrical (4) sound</em></p>
<p id="966a"><em>3. Because copper is a metal, it is (1) liquid at room temperature (2) nonreactive with other substances (3) a poor conductor of electricity (4) a good conductor of heat</em></p>
<p id="6d70"><em>4. Which process in an apple tree primarily results from cell division? (1) growth (2) photosynthesis (3) gas exchange (4) waste removal</em></p>
<p id="3a8a">On the 8th grade, non-diagram based questions of the test, a program was recently able to score 90%. (&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<p id="2f49"><strong>C)</strong></p>
<p id="267a">It’s not just about answer selection either. Progress in text generation has been impressive. See, for example, some of the text samples created by Megatron:&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf</a></p>
<p id="b8f7"><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p id="db13">Much of this progress has been rapid. Big progress on the Winograd schema, for example, still looked like it might be decades away back in (from memory) much of 2018. The computer science is advancing very fast, but it’s not clear our concepts have kept up.</p>
<p id="1a6c">I found this relatively sudden progress in NLP surprising. In my head- and maybe this was naive- I had thought that, in order to attempt these sorts of tasks with any facility, it wouldn’t be sufficient to simply feed a computer lots of text. Instead, any “proper” attempt to understand language would have to integrate different modalities of experience and understanding, like visual and auditory, in order to build up a full picture of how things relate to each other in the world. Only on the basis of this extra-linguistic grounding could it deal flexibly with problems involving rich meanings- we might call this the multi-modality thesis. Whether the multi-modality thesis is true for some kinds of problems or not, it’s certainly true for far fewer problems than I, and many others, had suspected.</p>
<p id="5a4d">I think science-fictiony speculations generally backed me up on this (false) hunch. Most people imagined that this kind of high-level language “understanding” would be the capstone of AI research, the thing that comes after the program already has a sophisticated extra-linguistic model of the world. This sort of just seemed obvious- a great example of how assumptions you didn’t even know you were making can ruin attempts to predict the future.</p>
<p id="f943">In hindsight it makes a certain sense that reams and reams of text alone can be used to build the capabilities needed to answer questions like these. A lot of people remind us that these programs are really just statistical analyses of the co-occurence of words, however complex and glorified. However we should not forget that the relationships between words are isomorphic to the relations between things- that isomorphism is why language works. This is to say the patterns in language use mirror the patterns of how things are(1). Models are transitive- if x models y, and y models z, then x models z. The upshot of these facts are that if you have a really good statistical model of how words relate to each other, that model is also implicitly a model of the world.</p>
<p id="12db">It might be instructive to think about what it would take to create a program which has a model of eighth grade science sufficient to understand and answer questions about hundreds of different things like “growth is driven by cell division”, and “What can magnets be used for” that wasn’t NLP led. It would be a nightmare of many different (probably handcrafted) models. Speaking somewhat loosely, language allows for intellectual capacities to be greatly compressed. From this point of view, it shouldn’t be surprising that some of the first signs of really broad capacity- common sense reasoning, wide ranging problem solving etc., have been found in language based programs- words and their relationships are just a vastly more efficient way of representing knowledge than the alternatives.</p>
<p id="1e8b">So I find myself wondering if language is not the crown of general intelligence, but a potential shortcut to it.</p>
<p id="beea"><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p id="0095">A couple of weeks ago I finished this essay, read through it, and decided it was not good enough to publish. The point about language being isomorphic to the world, and that therefore any sufficiently good model of language&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a model of the world, is important, but it’s kind of abstract, and far from original.</p>
<p id="e0e2">Then today I read&nbsp;<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this report</a>&nbsp;by Scott Alexander of having trained GPT-2 (a language program) to play chess. I realised this was the perfect example. GPT-2 has no (visual) understanding of things like the arrangement of a chess board. But if you feed it enough sequences of alphanumerically encoded games- 1.Kt-f3, d5 and so on- it begins to understand patterns in these strings of characters which are isomorphic to chess itself. Thus, for all intents and purposes, it develops a model of chess.</p>
<p id="1a14">Exactly how strong this approach is- whether GPT-2 is capable of some limited analysis, or can only overfit openings- remains to be seen. We might have a better idea as it is optimised — for example, once it is fed board states instead of sequences of moves. Either way though, it illustrates the point about isomorphism.</p>
<p id="a87a">Of course everyday language stands in a woolier relation to sheep, pine cones, desire and quarks than the formal language of chess moves stands in relation to chess moves, and the patterns are far more complex. Modality, uncertainty, vagueness and other complexities enter but the isomorphism between world and language is there, even if inexact.</p>
<p id="b6c0"><strong>Postscript- The Chinese Room Argument</strong></p>
<p id="f901">After similar arguments are made, someone usually mentions the Chinese room thought experiment. There are, I think, two useful things to say about it:</p>
<p id="3d7e">A) The thought experiment is an argument about understanding in itself, separate from capacity to handle tasks, a difficult thing to quantify or understand. It’s unclear that there is a practical upshot for what <em>AI can actually do.</em></p>
<p id="1f79">B) A lot of the power of the thought experiment hinges on the fact that the room solves questions using a lookup table, this stacks the deck. Perhaps we be more willing to say that the room as a whole understood language if it formed an (implicit) model of how things are, and of the current context, and used those models to answer questions? Even if this doesn’t deal with all the intuition that the room cannot understand Chinese, I think it takes a bite from it.</p>
<p id="96a9">— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —</p>
<p id="4642">(1)- Strictly of course only the patterns in true sentences mirror, or are isomorphic to, the arrangement of the world, but most sentences people utter are at least approximately true.</p>

– Tim Rocktäschel, 30/04/2018 – <i>updated 02/05/2018</i>
</p>

<p>
When talking to colleagues I realized that not everyone knows about <i>einsum</i>, my favorite function for developing deep learning models. 
This post is trying to change that once and for all! :)
Einstein summation (einsum) is implemented in <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html">numpy</a>, as well as deep learning libraries such as <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/einsum">TensorFlow</a> and, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/6307">Thomas Viehmann</a>, recently also <a href="http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torch.html?highlight=torch%20max#torch.einsum">PyTorch</a>. 
For background reading on einsum, I recommend the excellent blog posts by <a href="https://obilaniu6266h16.wordpress.com/2016/02/04/einstein-summation-in-numpy/">Olexa Bilaniuk</a> and <a href="http://ajcr.net/Basic-guide-to-einsum/">Alex Riley</a>.
While their posts discuss einsum in the context of numpy, I am going to illustrate how einsum is extremely useful for writing elegant PyTorch/TensorFlow models.<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>
<div id="outline-container-orge7a71ce">
<h2 id="orge7a71ce"><span>1</span> Einsum Notation<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup></h2>
<div id="text-1">
<p>
If you are anything like me, you find it difficult to remember the names and signatures of all the different functions in PyTorch/TensorFlow for calculating dot products, outer products, transposes and matrix-vector or matrix-matrix multiplications. 
Einsum notation is an elegant way to express all of these, as well as complex operations on tensors, using essentially a domain-specific language.  
This has benefits beyond not having to memorize or regularly looking up specific library functions.
Once you understand and make use of einsum, you will be able to write more concise and efficient code more quickly.
When not using einsum it is easy to introduce unnecessary reshaping and transposing of tensors, as well as intermediate tensors that could be omitted.
Furthermore, domain-specific languages like einsum can sometimes be compiled to high-performing code, and an einsum-like domain-specific language is in fact the basis for the recently introduced <a href="http://pytorch.org/2018/03/05/tensor-comprehensions.html">Tensor Comprehensions</a><sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> in PyTorch which automatically generate GPU code and auto-tune that code for specific input sizes. 
In addition, projects like <a href="https://github.com/dgasmith/opt_einsum">opt einsum</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Bihaqo/tf_einsum_opt">tf einsum opt</a> can be used to optimize tensor contraction order of einsum expressions.<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Let's say we want to multiply two matrices \({\color{red}\mathbf{A}}\in\mathbb{R}^{I\,\times\,K}\) and \({\color{blue}\mathbf{B}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\,\times\,J}\) followed by calculating the sum of each column resulting in a vector \({\color{green}\mathbf{c}}\in\mathbb{R}^{J}\).
Using Einstein summation notation, we can write this as
\[
{\color{green}c_j} = \sum_i\sum_k {\color{red}A_{ik}}{\color{blue}B_{kj}} = {\color{red}A_{ik}}{\color{blue}B_{kj}}
\]
which specifies how all individual elements \({\color{green}c_i}\) in \(\color{green}\mathbf{c}\) are calculated from multiplying values in the column vectors \(\color{red}\mathbf{A}_{i:}\) and row vectors \(\color{blue}\mathbf{B}_{:j}\) and summing them up.
Note that for Einstein notation, the summation Sigmas can be dropped as we implicitly sum over repeated indices (\(k\) in this example) and indices not mentioned in the output specification (\(i\) in this example).
So far so good, but we can also express more basic operations using einsum. For instance, calculating the dot product of two vectors \({\color{red}\mathbf{a}},{\color{blue}\mathbf{b}}\in\mathbb{R}^I\) can be written as
\[
{\color{green}c} = \sum_i {\color{red}a_i}{\color{blue}b_i} = {\color{red}a_i}{\color{blue}b_i}.
\] 
A problem that I encounter often in deep learning is applying a transformation to vectors in a higher-order tensor. For example, I might have a tensor that contains $T$-long sequences of $K$-dimensional word vectors for \(N\) training examples in a batch and I want to project the word vectors to a different dimension \(Q\).
Let \({\color{red}\mathcal{T}}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\,\times\,T\times\,K}\) be an order-3 tensor where the first dimension corresponds to the batch, the second dimension to the sequence length, and the last dimension to the word vectors. 
In addition, let \({\color{blue}\mathbf{W}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\,\times\,Q}\) be a projection matrix. The desired computation can be expressed using einsum
\[
{\color{green}C_{ntq}} = \sum_k {\color{red}T_{ntk}}{\color{blue}W_{kq}} = {\color{red}T_{ntk}}{\color{blue}W_{kq}}.
\]
As a final example, say you are given an order-4 tensor \({\color{red}\mathcal{T}}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\,\times\,T\times\,K\,\times\,M}\) and you are supposed to project vectors in the 3rd dimension to \(Q\) using the projection matrix from before. However, let's say I also ask you to sum over the 2nd dimension and transpose the first and last dimension in the result, yielding a tensor \({\color{green}\mathcal{C}}\in\mathbb{R}^{M\,\times,Q\times\,N}\).<sup><a id="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> Einsum to the rescue! 
\[
{\color{green}C_{mqn}} = \sum_t\sum_k {\color{red}T_{ntkm}}{\color{blue}W_{kq}} = {\color{red}T_{ntkm}}{\color{blue}W_{kq}}.
\]
Note that transposing the result of the tensor contraction is achieved by swapping \(n\) with \(m\) (\({\color{green}C_{mqn}}\) instead of \({\color{green}C_{nqm}}\)).

<div id="outline-container-orgcd1f902">
<h2 id="orgcd1f902"><span>2</span> All you Need: Einsum in numpy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow</h2>
<div id="text-2">
<p>
Einsum is implemented in <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html">numpy</a> via <code>np.einsum</code>, in <a href="http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torch.html?highlight=torch%20max#torch.einsum">PyTorch</a> via <code>torch.einsum</code>, and in <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/einsum">TensorFlow</a> via <code>tf.einsum</code>.<sup><a id="fnr.6" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> All three einsum functions share the same signature <code>einsum(equation,operands)</code> where <code>equation</code> is a string representing the Einstein summation and <code>operands</code> is a sequence of tensors.<sup><a id="fnr.7" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>
The examples above can all be written using an equation string. 
For instance, our first example \({\color{green}c_j} = \sum_i\sum_k {\color{red}A_{ik}}{\color{blue}B_{kj}}\) can be written as the equation string "\({\color{red}ik},{\color{blue}kj}\) -&gt; \({\color{green}j}\)". 
Note that the naming of the indices (\(i\), \(j\), \(k\)) is arbitrary but it needs to be used consistently. 
</p>

<p>
What's great about having einsum not only in numpy but also in PyTorch and TensorFlow is that it can be used in arbitrary computation graphs for neural network architectures and that we can backpropagate through it.
A typical call to einsum has the following form
\[
{\color{green}\textbf{result}} = \text{einsum}("{\color{red}\square\square},{\color{purple}\square\square\square},{\color{blue}\square\square}\,\text{-&gt;}\,{\color{green}\square\square}", {\color{red}\text{arg1}}, {\color{purple}\text{arg2}}, {\color{blue}\text{arg3}})
\]
where \(\square\) is a placeholder for a character identifying a tensor dimension.
From this equation string we can infer that \({\color{red}\text{arg1}}\) and \({\color{blue}\text{arg3}}\) are matrices, \({\color{purple}\text{arg2}}\) is an order-3 tensor, and that the \({\color{green}\textbf{result}}\) of this einsum operation is a matrix.
Note that einsum works with a variable number of inputs.
In the example above, einsum specifies an operation on three arguments, but it can also be used for operations involving one, two or more than three arguments.
Einsum is best learned by studying examples, so let's go through some examples for einsum in PyTorch that correspond to library functions which are used in many deep learning models.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi everybody, happy Friday! I am Aaron Klotz, a Staff Software Engineer on the GeckoView team at Mozilla Corporation.</p>
<p>I have worked at Mozilla since the fall of 2012 and have worked on three different teams across that time: Performance, Platform Integration &amp; Security Hardening, and finally GeckoView.</p>
<p>Given the recent news about layoffs, I thought it might be cathartic to do an AMA to share my experiences at Mozilla and try to set the record straight the best that I can. I would not dare try this in other forums, but since the Tildes community is capable of civil discussion, I'll do it here! I provided some proof a long time ago when I first joined Tildes, and I'd like to think that many people in this community are willing to vouch for me at this point, but if you want more, I can add it.</p>
<p>Obviously I cannot discuss issues that are covered by my NDA (but fortunately most issues are <em>not</em> covered), and some details I might want to avoid out of sensitivity for people who were laid off. AMAA!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Also to make clear (if it wasn't obvious): These opinions are mine and mine alone, do not reflect the opinion of any Mozilla entity, etc. etc.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I'm logging off for the night, but I'll try to follow up throughout the weekend if I have time. Thanks for all the questions! Hopefully I've cleared up some things for you!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong> Okay, I think I've gone through the other questions asked over the weekend, but I'm going to stop now! Thanks for your interest! Now, I've got a mobile browser to help build!</p>

<div>
	<p>The <a href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/">Trunk Based Development website</a> says “[…] a source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called “trunk” and resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.”</p>
<p>That sounds great… but what exactly is it, and why should you care about it? For a bit, let’s forget about code and branches and use an analogy that is easier to understand — the transit system of a city.</p>

<h4>When is the next train?</h4>
<p>Imagine a city with lots of different train stations. The network can run using lots of trains at different frequencies. Let’s consider three different scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>A train passes through each station once every day</li>
<li>Trains pass through each station six times every day</li>
<li>Trains pass through each station a hundred times every day</li>
</ul>

<p>What will be the effect of the three different possibilities on the people living in the city?</p>
<p><b>In the first case</b>, if a person misses the train there is no other way to reach the destination until the next train, which unfortunately will arrive on the next day.</p>
<p><b>In the second case</b>, if a person misses one train they can catch another train in a few hours and won’t have to wait for an entire day to reach their destination. This means people don’t care about the schedule of the trains as much as they do in the first case. It is possible to reach the destination in a few hours — late, but possible.</p>
<p><b>In the last case</b>, if a person misses a train they can easily catch another train in a few minutes. It’s easy to imagine that people will stop caring about the train schedule altogether and focus on what they want to do at the destination. The transit system becomes an artifact that recedes in the background, letting people concentrate on what they actually want to do — living their lives and getting things done!</p>
<p>Now let’s go back to building and delivering software.</p>

<h4>Feature-driven delivery a.k.a. Unpredictability</h4>
<p>In a lot of teams, the frequency of releases is determined by “when this Important List of Features gets done”. That leads to unpredictable releases with large delays between deployments. Although such teams try to “fix” a release date and try to cut scope so that the Very Important Date can be met, it rarely works.</p>
<p>Engineers working on different feature branches rush to get their tasks done before The Date. Merging all of those feature branches becomes a painful ritual as people discover all sorts of changes that have happened in the repository over the past few weeks that they were working on their own branch. Merge meetings are scheduled and a War Room is created to tackle issues that stand in the way of meeting The Date. Inevitable, The Date starts to move. Seven “medium priority” bugs that customers have been complaining about need to be fixed. The CEO’s personal favourite feature request has to be part of this release even though the team heard of it a week ago.</p>
<p>Every little thing is important because who knows when the next release will go out? The entire team — nay the org — rallies around The Date even though it has changed three times and the original date has been forgotten.</p>
<p>There are some themes that emerge in this familiar scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge hell</b>, as discussed above, since multiple, long-running feature branches become part of the primary codebase very close to The Date.</li>
<li><b>Massive changesets</b> to review, or what happens in reality, no code review at all. Reviewing a three-thousand line diff that has been worked on for two weeks is an exercise in frustration.</li>
<li><b>Favouring the Rockstar Programmer</b> over the team, since it is considered acceptable and natural that a great engineer will disappear for a few days or weeks, and come back with all the work done in a branch far, far away from the rest of the codebase. Merging is the team’s collective problem, unfortunately.</li>
<li><b>Emotional turmoil</b> and a high probability of burnout for everyone in the team especially as The Date inches closer.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what is the solution to this problem? We need to increase the frequency of the trains, of course. Hundreds of them every day!</p>

<h4>Timeline-driven Delivery a.k.a. Daily Success</h4>
<p>For software engineering, that implies…</p>
<ul>
<li>We increase the frequency of production releases to as frequent as possible — daily, or even hourly!</li>
<li>We drastically reduce the size of changes that are merged into the trunk. As each merge request becomes small, reviewing it becomes far easier.</li>
<li>Since each merge integrates only a small number of changes, the possibility of conflicts also rapidly goes down. When conflicts do happen, resolving them is fast and painless.</li>
<li>Changes arrive into the codebase on a daily basis, which means the team is aware of the state of work that is in progress. Any impact from the changes being done is felt very early in the process, giving the team ample time to reach a resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this sounds great in theory and it makes sense. How about in practice?</p>
<ul>
<li>TBD promotes <b>short-lived feature branches</b> and frequent merges with the trunk. A branch usually has only one developer, it doesn’t last more than a day or two before it gets merged into the trunk.</li>
<li>This automatically pushes teams towards <b>Continuous Integration</b>. Every commit that lands on the trunk goes through the CI pipeline, confirming that it is indeed ready for integration.</li>
<li>Once continuous integration is in place, it is natural to follow it up with <b>Continuous Delivery</b>. Since all commits that land on trunk have been marked “stable” by the CI pipeline, they can be deployed immediately.</li>
<li>Since an approved code review means the code will be available on trunk immediately, <b>teams rally together to review code</b> as fast and as many times as possible.</li>
<li>Not everything can be done within a day, and features can take a long time to build. In those cases, <b>work-in-progress code is “hidden” behind a feature flag</b>. Flags ensure that incomplete features can be reviewed and still land on the trunk.</li>
<li>Flags can also <b>act as a remote control</b> for making features available at a later time. Features can be fully developed and be part of the codebase, and then be remotely toggled on (or off). Once a feature has been “enabled”, the alternative code path and flags can be deleted from the codebase.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this comes together to ensure the codebase is releasable on demand. Bug fixes are deployed as soon as the fix is available on the trunk. Teams stop coordinating releases to figure out which commits are “safe” to release.</p>
<p>Developers go back to focusing on what is important — building features and eliminating bugs — rather than being burdened with a release date.</p>

August 16, 2020 | https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/function-types/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/function-types/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>This article builds on my earlier articles on <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/roles-as-adts-in-raku/">algebraic data types</a> in on <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a> and their use in the practical example of <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/list-based-parser-combinators/">list-based parser combinators</a>. </p>

<p>In this article I want to look at function types in some detail, and show a way to create well typed functions in Raku. If you are not familiar with functional programming (or with <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a>), I suggest you read my introduction <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/decluttering-with-functional-programming/">"Cleaner code with functional programming"</a>. If you are not familiar with algebraic data types, you might want to read the other two articles as well. For most of the article, I provide examples in Raku, Python, Rust and Haskell. There is also some C and even some Fortran. </p>

<h2>Type signatures</h2>

<p>A function's type signature consists of the types of each of its arguments and the return type. In most typed languages, the type is part of the function signature. </p>

<p>For example in C</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span></span><span>int</span> <span>sqsum</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>sqsum</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>or in Fortran</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fortran"><span></span><span>integer </span><span>function </span><span>sqsum</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
    <span>integer</span> <span>::</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span><span>y</span>
    <span>sqsum</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>
<span>end function</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>or in Rust</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>sqsum</span><span>((</span><span>x</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>)</span>: <span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>i32</span><span>))</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>sqsum</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span>x</span><span> </span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>|</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>};</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>or in Raku</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>sqsum</span>(<span>Int</span>, <span>Int</span> --&gt; <span>Int</span>) {...}
<span>sub</span> <span>sqsum</span>(<span>Int</span> \<span>x</span>, <span>Int</span> \<span>y</span> --&gt; <span>Int</span>) { <span>x*x+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span> }

<span>my</span> <span>&amp;sqsum</span> = <span>sub</span> (<span>Int</span> \<span>x</span>, <span>Int</span> \<span>y</span> --&gt; <span>Int</span>) { <span>x*x+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span> };
</code></pre></div>
<p>or in Python, using the <code>typing</code> module:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>sqsum_</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span>  
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>

<span>sqsum</span> <span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span>int</span><span>],</span> <span>int</span><span>]</span>  <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span><span>y</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>The type of a function of functions</h2>

<p>But what happens if we want to provide a function argument that is itself a function, or return a function (so-called <em>higher-order functions</em>)?</p>

<p>This is possible in most languages, but what I am interested in is the type information: what is the type signature of such a function of functions?</p>

<p>C supports functions-of-functions indirectly through function pointers, by creating a function type through a <code>typedef</code>. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>int</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Fun</span><span>)(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>ten_times</span> <span>(</span><span>Fun</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>{...};</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Maybe surprisingly, venerable old Fortran does support passing functions and subroutines as arguments. Functions are typed by their return type; subroutines are not typed. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fortran"><span></span><span>program </span><span>fof</span> 
    <span>external</span> <span>::</span> <span>sqsum</span>
    <span>call </span><span>ten_times</span><span>(</span><span>sqsum</span><span>)</span>
<span>end program </span><span>fof</span>

<span>subroutine </span><span>ten_times</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
    <span>integer</span> <span>::</span> <span>f</span>
    <span>! ...</span>
<span>end subroutine </span><span>ten_times</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Rust you can provide the complete type of a function-as-argument: </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>ten_times</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>f</span>: <span>F</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>F</span>: <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span><span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>ten_times</span><span>(</span><span>sqsum</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Python we can use <code>Callable</code>, which also allow for the complete type to be expressed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>ten_times</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>],</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
<span># ...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The same example in Raku becomes</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>ten_times</span> (<span>Sub</span> \<span>f:</span>(<span>Int</span>,<span>Int</span> --&gt; <span>Int</span>)) {
<span>#...</span>
}

<span>ten_times</span>(<span>sqsum</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<p>So we can also pass the complete type. An equivalent way to write this is using the <code>&amp;</code> sigil <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-sigil_&amp;">which imposes the <code>Callable</code> type constraint</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>ten_times</span> (<span>&amp;f:</span>(<span>Int</span>,<span>Int</span> --&gt; <span>Int</span>)) {
<span>#...</span>
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The types can be nested too, e.g. <code>((Int, Int --&gt; Int), (Int, Int --&gt; Int) --&gt; Int))</code> is a valid type signature.</p>

<h2>Introducing the arrow</h2>

<p>All of the above ways to express function type signatures are perfectly adequate in their respective languages. However, with the exception of Raku, they all share the problem that these function-of-function type signatures don't compose very well: what if we want to write a function-of-function-of-function type? This is less far-fetched than it may seem.
I would like to introduce a notation used in type theory. It is at the same time simple and powerful. If you are familiar with functional languages like Haskell, Idris or Agda, you already know it. </p>

<p>Instead of mixing the type with the function declaration, it is written separately. The name of the function is followed by a colon and the list types of the arguments and the return value. Each argument is separated by an arrow. The above example of a function of two integer arguments returning an integer would be:</p>

<p>The function-of-a-function introduced above has as type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>ten_times</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>Int</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>⟶</span>  <span>Int</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The parentheses group the type of the function that is the only argument of <code>ten_times</code>.</p>

<p>In this notation, the arrow can be interpreted as an operator which creates a function type from the two types that are its arguments. The important property of this operator is that it is right associative. What this means is that for example </p>

<p>is the same as</p>

<p>and as</p>

<p>and for completeness</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>f</span> <span>:</span> <span>t1</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>(</span><span>t2</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>(</span><span>t3</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>t4</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>A detour into partial application</h2>

<p>The above groupings imply that our function <code>f</code> can be interpreted in three ways, as a function of:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 arguments of types <code>t1</code>,<code>t2</code>,<code>t3</code>, returning a result of type <code>t4</code>;</li>
<li>2 arguments of types <code>t1</code>,<code>t2</code>, returning a result of type <code>t3 -&gt; t4</code>; </li>
<li>1 argument of types <code>t1</code>, returning a result of type <code>t2-&gt;t3-&gt;t4</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's say we have values <code>v1</code>,<code>v2</code>,<code>v3</code> for the arguments and <code>v4</code> as the result:</p>

<p>But suppose we only apply <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text"><span></span>pf1 : t3 ⟶ t4
pf1 = f v1 v2
</code></pre></div>
<p>We get a new function <code>pf1</code> which takes a single argument <code>v3</code>: </p>

<p>And in the same way we can create <code>pf2</code> and <code>pf3</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>pf2</span> <span>:</span> <span>t2</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>t3</span> <span>⟶</span><span>t4</span>
<span>pf2</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span> <span>v1</span>

<span>pf3</span> <span>:</span> <span>t3</span> <span>⟶</span> <span>t4</span>
<span>pf3</span> <span>=</span> <span>pf2</span> <span>v2</span>

<span>v4</span> <span>=</span> <span>pf3</span> <span>v3</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Because <code>pf1</code>, <code>pf2</code> and <code>pf3</code> are functions and the above is true for all values of <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code>, <code>v3</code> and <code>v4</code>, it follows that</p>

<p>For completeness, we can also apply <code>pf2</code> directly to two arguments:</p>

<p>This concept of creating a new function by not providing values for some of the arguments is called <em>partial application</em>, and many languages support it. Here are examples in Haskell, Raku, Python and Rust.</p>

<h3>Haskell</h3>

<p>In case you are not familiar with Haskell, this is what you need to know: it is whitespace-sensitive like Python, but has a markedly different syntax. Because everything is a function, there is no keyword to mark a function. Because there is only lexical scope, there is no need for any special scope identifiers. Function arguments are separated by spaces. Lambda functions (anonymous functions) start with a <code>\</code>,  chosen because it looks a bit like the Greek letter lambda, λ. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>-- named function of 2 arguments</span>
<span>sqsum</span> <span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>
<span>-- lambda function bound to a named variable</span>
<span>sqsum</span> <span>=</span> <span>\</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The type of <code>sqsum</code> is 
<code>haskell
sqsum :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
</code>
(Haskell uses <code>::</code> rather than <code>:</code> for the type signature)</p>

<p>In Haskell, partial application works exactly as in the examples above. So our function <code>sqsum</code> can be partially applied like this: </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>sqsum4</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>sqsum4</span> <span>=</span> <span>sqsum</span> <span>4</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can apply <code>sqsum4</code> to the remaining argument:</p>

<p>This is very neat. But suppose you want to apply the second argument, rather than the first one? The Haskell Prelude library provides the function <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:flip">flip</a>, which simply flips the arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>flip</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>c</span> 
<span>flip</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>\</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>y</span> <span>x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That is fine as far as it goes, but let's do a somewhat contrived example. Let's say we have a function of four arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>g</span> <span>::</span> <span>t1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t2</span> <span>-&gt;</span><span>t3</span> <span>-&gt;</span><span>t4</span> <span>-&gt;</span><span>tr</span>
<span>g</span> <span>x1</span> <span>x2</span> <span>x3</span> <span>x4</span> <span>=</span> <span>x1</span><span>*</span><span>x3</span><span>-</span><span>x2</span><span>*</span><span>x4</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and we want to apply the 1st and 4th argument but not the others, something like <code>g v1 _ _ v4</code>.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to create yet another function (of course!):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>apply14</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>t1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t3</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t4</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>tr</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t4</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>t2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>t3</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>tr</span><span>)</span>
<span>apply14</span> <span>f</span> <span>x1</span> <span>x4</span> <span>=</span> <span>\</span><span>x2</span> <span>x3</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>x1</span> <span>x2</span> <span>x3</span> <span>x4</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And with this function we can partially apply the 1st and 4th argument of <code>g</code>:</p>

<p>This example mainly serves to illustrate the power of the arrow-based function type notation: it lays out the type of <code>apply14</code> clearly and concisely. </p>

<h3>Raku</h3>

<p>Raku provides the method <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/assuming">assuming</a>, which acts as a generalised version of our <code>apply14</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>&amp;g14</span> = <span>&amp;g</span>.<span>assuming</span>( <span>v1</span>, *, *, <span>v4</span>);

<span>g14</span>(<span>v2</span>,<span>v3</span>); 
</code></pre></div>
<p>The return type of <code>assuming</code> is a <code>Callable</code>. This is a role for objects which support calling them. Thus, <code>g14</code> can be called as if it was a regular function.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p>Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html">functools</a> provide the <code>partial</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>from</span> <span>functools</span> <span>import</span> <span>partial</span>
<span>g14</span> <span>=</span> <span>partial</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>,</span> <span>x1</span><span>=</span><span>v1</span><span>,</span><span>x4</span><span>=</span><span>v4</span><span>)</span>

<span>g14</span><span>(</span><span>v2</span><span>,</span><span>v3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The return type of <code>partial</code> is a <code>partial</code> object, which has an attribute <code>partial.func</code>, a callable object or function. Calls to the partial object will be forwarded to func with new arguments and keywords, so you can say <code>g14(v2,v3)</code> instead of <code>g14.func(v2,v3)</code>.</p>

<h3>Rust</h3>

<p>Rust provides the <code>partial!</code> macro via its <a href="https://docs.rs/partial_application/0.2.1/partial_application/">partial_application</a> crate. Its behaviour is very similar to our <code>apply14</code>: "<code>partial!(some_fn =&gt; arg0, _, arg2, _)</code> returns the closure <code>|x1, x3| some_fn(arg0, x1, arg2, x3)</code>". </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span></span><span>#[macro_use]</span><span></span>
<span>extern</span><span> </span><span>crate</span><span> </span><span>partial_application</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>g</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>x2</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>x3</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>x4</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x1</span><span>*</span><span>x3</span><span>-</span><span>x2</span><span>*</span><span>x4</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>v1</span><span>=</span><span>...;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>v2</span><span>=</span><span>...;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>v3</span><span>=</span><span>...;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>v4</span><span>=</span><span>...;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>g14</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>partial</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>v1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>v4</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>g14</span><span>(</span><span>v2</span><span>,</span><span>v3</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Back to the function types</h2>

<p>Suppose we want a type like the one we defined in C using a <code>typedef</code>, which encapsulates the function type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>int</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Fun</span><span>)(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Haskell, that would be</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>Fun</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fun</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and we can generalise this to be a generic function of two arguments by using type variables instead of concrete types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So how would we use this? Let's create an instance</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>ft</span> <span>::</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>a</span>
<span>ft</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>(</span><span>\</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is fine, but to apply the function we first must unwrap the type constructor:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>((</span><span>\</span><span>(</span><span>Fun2Args</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>ft</span> <span>)</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That is not very handy. A better way is to use the record type syntax which gives us an accessor function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>{</span> <span>unF</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>}</span>
<span>ft</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fun2Args</span> <span>(</span><span>\</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>unF</span> <span>ft</span><span>)</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now I have applied this to integer, but the type of the function is <code>Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code>, so this works for any type in the <code>Num</code> typeclass.</p>

<h2>Named function types for Raku</h2>

<p>In Raku, we can follow a similar approach of wrapping a function signature in a type, and it is actually simpler than in Haskell. We create a parametric role which takes the function as a parameter, and has a method with the signature of the function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>role</span> <span>Fun2NumArgs</span>[<span>&amp;b</span>] {
    <span>method</span> <span>unF</span>( <span>Numeric</span> \<span>x</span>,  <span>Numeric</span> \<span>y</span> --&gt; <span>Numeric</span>) {
        <span>&amp;b</span>(<span>x</span>,<span>y</span>);
    }
}

<span>my</span> \<span>ft</span> = <span>Fun2NumArgs</span>[ -&gt;\<span>x</span>,\<span>y</span> {<span>x*x+</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span>} ].<span>new</span>;

<span>say</span> <span>ft</span>.<span>unF</span>(<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>); 
</code></pre></div>
<p>But what is the benefit of doing this? Surely we could just have done</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>&amp;f</span> =  -&gt; <span>Numeric</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div>

<p>I'm a science fiction writer, so I quite enjoy thinking about self-driving cars. They make for really interesting analogies about data, liability, self-determination, information security and openness.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write fiction about this! Deakin University commissioned "Car Wars," a short story about the sociotechnological issues raised by autonomous vehicle thought-experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>(they also got a faculty member to write a quiz for it whose correct answers take a 180' different view to my own!)</p>
<p>And without any spoilers here, I'll say that subverted, lethal autonomous vehicles are a key plot point in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book, coming out in Oct.</p>
<p><a href="https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/">https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/</a></p>
<p>But I'm a science fiction writer and that means I can tell the difference between "thought experiments" and "real things." Alas, the same cannot be said of corporate America.</p>
<p>For example, according to its own IPO filings, Uber can only be profitable if it invents fully autonomous vehicles and replaces every public transit ride in the world with them.</p>
<p>Elon Musk – a man whose "green electric car company" is only profitable thanks to the carbon credits it sells to manufacturers of the dirtiest SUVs in America, without which those planet-killing SUVs would not exist – makes the same mistake.</p>
<p>Musk wants to abolish public transit and replace it with EVs (he says that public transit makes you sit next to strangers who might be serial killers, which tells you a lot about his view of humanity).</p>
<p>Now, both Uber and Musk are both wrong as a matter of simple geometry. Multiply the space occupied by all those AVs by the journeys people in cities need to make by the additional distances of those journeys if we need road for all those cars, and you run out of space.</p>
<p>It's a trivially modelable Red Queen's Race, in which the more cars you add, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need…</p>
<p>Indeed, these fairy tales require so much credulity to be taken seriously that they strain even the car-addled imaginations of American automotive culture, and also rely on the irrational exuberance inspired by imaginary self-driving cars to propagate and persist.</p>
<p>But that exuberance is sorely misplaced. Machine learning systems have brittle and unpredictable failure modes that can be triggered by accident or deliberately. The unconstrained problem of navigating busy cities with unquantifiable human activities is insoluble with ML.</p>
<p>Or, at least, it's insoluble if you care about whether cars kill even more people in even less predictable ways than they do now.</p>
<p>This is a lesson that Ford CEO Jim Hackett just learned the hard way.</p>

<p>After investing heavily in the technology and boasting about how Ford's future was a bet on the imminent arrival of AVs, Hackett has had to admit that "We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles."</p>
<p>The company has sunk $4b into the technology. But there's gotta be a pony under there somewhere:</p>

<p>Genomist Adam Rutherford is a gifted science communicator; the podcast he co-hosts, "The Curious Cases of Rutherford and Fry" is one of the best popular science programs I've ever heard: charming and informative at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads</a></p>
<p>His 2017 book "A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived" used a survey of the state of the art in genomics to present an account of what we knew about human relatedness.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html">https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html</a></p>
<p>The most compelling part of "Brief History" was Rutherford's skewering of junk DNA sciecne, especially the home ancestry/genetic testing industry, with its claims of being able to tell you if you're 32% viking and if so, which red wine you're genetically programmed to enjoy.</p>
<p>These sections are written with Rutherford's characteristic empathy – as someone who'd dedicated his life to genomics, he understands the impulse to connect your DNA with your life story – but they also warn about the harms arising from these false beliefs.</p>
<p>These harms are the subject of his new book, HOW TO ARGUE WITH A RACIST, a bestseller in the UK, just published in the US with new forematter updated in light of both the pandemic and the BLM uprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/">https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/</a></p>
<p>Superficially, the "race science" promulgated by white supremacists – often repeated by people who should know better, sometimes internalized by racialized people who are harmed by this pseudoscience – has the ring of plausibility.</p>
<p>Whether that's the fairy tales about "race" and ability ("Jews are smart because of medieval money-lending laws" or "Black people perform well in sports because of the slave trade's selective breeding") or the studies grouping humanity into races based on genetic divergence.</p>
<p>Chances are you've encountered this stuff and not known what to make of it but thought it benign or at least neutral. But sociologists have scraped white nationalist message-boards to document the centrality of this stuff to the rise of a new movement of would-be genociders.</p>
<p>"How to Argue" is a point-by-point rebuttal to these race realists. Despite the title, Rutherford doesn't really expect that you'll convince someone who's obsessed with whether they have "Jewish genes" or who worships their ability to break down lactose with his arguments.</p>
<p>Those people, after all, are motivated reasoners. They've started from the end-point – "appearances and life circumstances notwithstanding, I am superior and deserve better" – and worked their way backwards to justify that story to themselves.</p>
<p>As Jonathan Swift wrote (and as Rutherford quotes): "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into."</p>
<p>But it's not just motivated reasoners who absorb this garbage. There's a whole business model built on selling people junk DNA science that makes "race science" regrettably spreadable.</p>
<p>That's where Rutherford is aiming: people who've assumed that 23andme and its rivals wouldn't be able to make millions selling you diagnoses of the precise quantity of viking DNA in your blood if there wasn't something to it.</p>
<p>And here Rutherford shines. He is, after all, a gifted science communicator. This is one seriously <em>charming</em> book, funny and witty and just flat-out fascinating.</p>
<p>Rutherford doesn't merely want to disabuse you of the fantastical claims of Junk DNA Science – he wants to excite you about the incredible NEW things we're learning thanks to the rapid advances in genomics.</p>
<p>Like the fact that Africa is the most genetically diverse place on Earth, with two members of the Sen tribe from different regions being more genetically divergent than a Swede and an Australian Aboriginal person.</p>
<p>And the fact that you only need to go back 11 generations before you reach an ancestor whose DNA is likely completely missing from your own genome. Or the small number of centuries you have to look back before you find the first common ancestor of every European.</p>
<p>And the amount of genetic outflow and backflow between seemingly isolated places – Bronze Age Africa and Europe, say – and the waves of migration we can trace through genomes that eliminate any claim to national genetic commonality in any land.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what role genomics plays in the dominance of people from east Africa in footraces, or the number of Jewish Nobelists, Rutherford's here for you, unpicking what we know about the role of genes in these attainments (spoiler: they're not that important).</p>
<p>All leavened with gentle and devastating dunks on "race science" believers and the wit of Douglas Adams in his prime.</p>
<p>It may not help you win arguments with racists – they cannot be reasoned out of what they weren't reasoned into.</p>
<p>But it a powerful innoculant against the ideas drifting out of their foetid pits and into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the globe, lots of people are stuck
at home, either working remotely or sitting around without much to do. The
previous afternoon, I had stumbled across an online announcement that the
<a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2020/march/dl-access-during-covid-19">ACM Digital Library has been made free to all to read and download</a> to
help foster research, discovery, and learning during this time of crisis.
Feeling curious, and having previously wanted to read certain research papers
from the ACM DL previously, I took the opportunity to peruse through its library
and read as much content as I could. As I was doing so, I stumbled across a very
useful paper called <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3167132.3167261"><strong>"Syntax error recovery in parsing expression
grammars"</strong></a> by (Medeiros, S. and Fabio Mascarenhas, 2018) that I would
like to share, and I'll be testing some of its concepts using a prototype parser
written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> with the help of the <a href="https://docs.rs/nom"><code>nom</code></a> crate.</p>
<h2 id="some-background">Some background</h2>
<p>Language parsing is a very broad and interesting topic, with a swathe of varying
approaches and tools to choose from depending on the requirements of the task at
hand, but the basic premise is simple: the goal of a parser is to consume some
data as input, break it down into its component parts according to some grammar,
and derive meaning or understanding from it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">wiki</a>). I personally happen to
enjoy working with <em>parsing expression grammars</em> (PEGs) and <em>parser combinators</em>
when writing my own projects.</p>
<p>In case you are not familiar, PEG is a kind of declarative formal language for
describing other languages in terms of string pattern matching. That is, PEG
allows the parser author to declare the grammar of the language they wish to
parse using sets of expressions like those shown below:</p>
<pre><span>expr    ← sum
sum     ← product (('+' / '-') product)*
product ← value (('*' / '/') value)*
value   ← [0-9]+ / '(' expr ')'
</span></pre>
<p>These PEG rules would then be able to describe the rules to a simple arithmetic
language that behaves like this:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Input</th><th>Parsed syntax tree</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>123</code></td><td><code>Value(123)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>1 + 2</code></td><td><code>Sum(Value(1), Value(2))</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>1 + 2 * 3</code></td><td><code>Sum(Value(1), Product(Value(2), Value(3)))</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>(1 + 2) * 3</code></td><td><code>Product(Sum(Value(1), Value(2)), Value(3))</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Any PEG expression can be converted directly into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent parser</a>,
either automatically using a parser generator or crafted by hand in the
programming language of your choice.</p>
<p>I really enjoy using parser combinator frameworks like <a href="https://docs.rs/nom"><code>nom</code></a> as a nice middle
ground between the two options, since they grant you the freedom and flexibility
of writing your parser fully in the host language (in this example, Rust), but
the resulting code is succinct, fairly declarative, and looks somewhat PEG-ish,
if you tilt your head and squint hard enough.</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>expr</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>sum</span><span>(input)
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> op = </span><span>alt</span><span>((</span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>+</span><span>'), </span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>-</span><span>')));
    </span><span>recognize</span><span>(</span><span>pair</span><span>(product, </span><span>many0</span><span>(</span><span>pair</span><span>(op, product))))(input)
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>product</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> op = </span><span>alt</span><span>((</span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>*</span><span>'), </span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>/</span><span>')));
    </span><span>recognize</span><span>(</span><span>pair</span><span>(value, </span><span>many0</span><span>(</span><span>pair</span><span>(op, value))))(input)
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>value</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>recognize</span><span>(</span><span>alt</span><span>((digit1, </span><span>delimited</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>(</span><span>'), expr, </span><span>char</span><span>('</span><span>)</span><span>')))))(input)
}
</span></pre>
<p>Each of the four parsers above corresponds to a PEG rule, and since each one is
represented as a pure function, they compose nicely in code and each one can
easily be tested in isolation from the others, e.g. with inline unit tests. All
in all, I enjoy working with PEG and parser combinators!</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I've been hacking on a parser and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a> for the <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix programming
language</a> as a side project (<a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/nix-language-server">GitHub</a>) for some time now, and this extended
period of being stuck at home renewed my interest in working on it. This
language server aims to supply code analysis, and auto-completion for compatible
third-party text editors and IDEs. This project has been very challenging for me
to work on, in a good way, because language servers tend to have very strict
requirements of their underlying parsers.</p>
<p>Most compilers and static analysis tools are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_program">batch programs</a> which act like a
dumb pipe, consuming source code in one end and spitting an executable out the
other (yes, incremental compilation and artifact caching bends this analogy a
bit, but the basic premise still holds). This means that their parsers and
resulting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">abstract syntax trees</a> are optimized for very different things than
what an interactive IDE would want.</p>
<p>Since the user is continuously modifying the source text and entering keystrokes
into their editor, the parser providing syntax checking for their editor is very
frequently exposed to incomplete or downright invalid snippets of code more
often than not. This means that halting parsing and bailing with an error
message whenever the first error is encountered, like many traditional parsers
do, is <em>simply not an option</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/76758522-1ee9ad80-678a-11ea-84cd-111739ecd379.gif" alt="rust-analyzer in action">
<em>Source: <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/thisweek/2020/03/16/changelog-16.html">rust-analyzer Changelog #16</a></em></p>
<p>Instead, the parser needs to be as fault-tolerant as possible, always producing
a syntax tree of some kind on every single parse and deriving as much syntactic
and semantic meaning as it can from user input, however malformed it might be.
Your editor should still be able to provide meaningful code completion, hover
documentation, go-to-definition, and symbol searching regardless of whether
there is a missing semicolon somewhere halfway down the page.</p>
<h2 id="a-naive-approach">A naive approach</h2>
<p>When I first started working on this project, I had chosen to implement my Nix
parser in Rust using <code>nom</code> 5.0, since that was the tool I was most comfortable
using for writing parsers at the time.</p>
<p>As I was writing up my parsers, I very quickly realized that bailing early from
parsing with an <code>Err(nom::Err::Error(_))</code> or <code>Err(nom::Error::Failure(_))</code>
wasn't a good idea for emitting errors. The former triggers a backtrack, which I
didn't always want, and the latter would halt parsing altogether with an error,
which I never wanted. <code>Err(nom::Error::Incomplete(_))</code> sounded promising due to
the name, but it too ended up being useless given the design constraints I had
in mind. I needed some way to log that a non-fatal parse error had been
encountered and resume parsing as though nothing had happened, but
unfortunately, there seemed to be nothing in the vast <code>nom</code> parser combinator
toolbox that could help me deal with this.</p>
<p>Given that <code>nom</code> parser combinators are pure functions whose signatures are
structured like this:</p>
<pre><span>impl </span><span>Fn(Input) -&gt; IResult&lt;Input, Output, Error&gt;
</span></pre>
<p>which maps to:</p>
<pre><span>impl </span><span>Fn(Input) -&gt; Result&lt;(Remaining, Output), Error&gt;
</span></pre>
<p>I decided to carry these non-fatal parse errors through the <code>Output</code> instead of
returning them through <code>Result::Err(nom::Error::Error(_))</code> using a custom data
structure which I had named <a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/nix-language-server/blob/master/nix-parser/src/parser/partial.rs#L64-L68"><code>Partial</code></a>. This was a monadic data structure which
was essentially:</p>
<pre><span>pub struct </span><span>Partial&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>value</span><span>: Option&lt;T&gt;,
    </span><span>errors</span><span>: Vec&lt;Error&gt;,
}

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T&gt; Partial&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>map</span><span>&lt;U, F&gt;(</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>f</span><span>: F) -&gt; Partial&lt;U&gt;
    </span><span>where</span><span>
        F: FnOnce(T) -&gt; U
    { ... }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>flat_map</span><span>&lt;U, F&gt;(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>f</span><span>: F) -&gt; Partial&lt;U&gt;
    </span><span>where</span><span>
        F: FnOnce(T) -&gt; Partial&lt;U&gt;
    { ... }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>value</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt; {
        ...
    }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>errors</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; &amp;[Error] {
        ...
    }

    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>verify</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;T, Vec&lt;Error&gt;&gt; {
        ...
    }
}
</span></pre>
<p>This data structure was complemented with a bunch of custom <code>nom</code> combinators,
e.g. <code>map_partial()</code>, <code>expect_terminated()</code>, and <code>skip_if_err()</code>, which would
allow me to compose these fault-tolerant parsers together while accumulating
errors in the <code>errors</code> field.</p>
<p>The consumer of this data structure would then choose to either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assert that they need a valid AST without errors by calling <code>expr.verify()</code>,
transforming the <code>Partial&lt;T&gt;</code> into a <code>Result&lt;T, Vec&lt;Error&gt;&gt;</code>. This option
would be useful for traditonal batch compiler authors, as well as for testing
and debugging.</li>
<li>Extract and examine the contents of the <code>value</code> and <code>errors</code> field
separately. This is what the language server would do: publish the
accumulated errors to the user's editor in the form of diagnostics and then
perform further analysis on the syntax tree contained in <code>value</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All the parser combinators would have this function signature instead:</p>
<pre><span>impl </span><span>Fn(Input) -&gt; IResult&lt;Input, Partial&lt;Output&gt;, Error&gt;
</span></pre>
<p>While this approach seemed to work well initially, it spiralled out of control
once the parser grew beyond a certain size. The number of <code>Partial</code> specific
combinators grew, the parser logic got hairier, more imperative, and trickier to
debug, and the performance implications of carrying around a heavy stack of
errors from function to function <a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/nix-language-server/commit/4cd939a2917709a527bd1967f4a29bfd9f2767cc">were astonishingly awful</a>. It didn't
look and feel that much like PEG anymore.</p>
<p>I will admit I learned a lot about a breadth of topics during this time, from
benchmarking functions with <a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs"><code>criterion</code></a> to generating flamegraphs with
<a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/flamegraph"><code>cargo-flamegraph</code></a>, and going to extreme lengths to avoid heap allocations to
make the parser as fast as possible. I used <a href="https://docs.rs/nom_locate"><code>nom_locate</code></a> to retain string span
information and be as zero-copy as possible when constructing the syntax tree.
But ultimately, I couldn't fix all the warts and fundamental flaws. I needed a
new approach.</p>
<h2 id="the-paper-s-solution">The paper's solution</h2>
<p>Finally, back to the paper that originally inspired this article! I shelved this
project some months ago due to work and personal life matters, but came back
to it last month with some fresh ideas and a better intuition of where to look.
Discouraged by the previous setbacks, I was questioning whether parser
combinators in general were flexible enough to express parsers which were both
permissive and fault-tolerant, while also emitting good hand-crafted
diagnostics. But then I stumbled upon the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3167132.3167261">"Syntax error recovery in parsing
expression grammars" (2018)</a> paper while scouring the ACM DL search
engine for interesting articles last night.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper actually managed to get pretty great results parsing
the <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua programming language</a> using a set of extended PEGs, producing excellent
tailor-made diagnostics rivaling the automatic error recovering capabilities of
their control, a top-down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser">LL parser</a>…</p></article></section></div>

<p>This is a quick writeup of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganographic</a> tool
that I threw together: <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/steg86"><em>steg86</em></a>. It uses a quirk of the
x86 instruction encoding format to hide messages in pre-existing binaries with no size or
performance overhead.</p>

<p>You can play with it yourself by fetching it with <code>cargo</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>cargo <span>install </span>steg86
<span>$ </span>steg86 <span>--help</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="a-quick-steganography-refresher">A quick steganography refresher</h2>

<p>Steganography is the practice of concealing data within other data. A variety of different
common formats open themselves up to steganographic channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Image formats: using the least significant bits of the color space</li>
  <li>Audio formats: hiding information in background noise, or hiding an image
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a></li>
  <li>Plain text: using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">homographs</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner">special spacing characters</a> to encode information</li>
</ul>

<p>On its own, steganography is <em>not</em> a replacement for cryptography: it’s strictly
obfuscatory, and does not provide any deniablity of the embedded message if revealed.</p>

<p>That being said, there exist a variety of use cases for steganographic schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coupled with strong cryptography, they <em>do</em> allow for deniability: depending on the format,
an extracted message can be made indistinguishable from random noise prior to decryption.</li>
  <li>Steganography can be used for fingerprinting and asset management.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Identification_Code">Commercial printers</a> are well-known for doing this;
video games have also used it to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/09/steganography_i_1.html">track users and their machines</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="doing-steganography-on-computer-programs">Doing steganography on computer programs</h2>

<p>There are two obvious avenues for doing steganography on compiled programs. <em>steg86</em> does
<strong>neither</strong> of these, but for the sake of completeness:</p>

<h3 id="instrumenting-the-program-via-the-compiler">Instrumenting the program via the compiler</h3>

<p>Compilers perform instruction selection to lower their internal representations into machine code.
Instruction selection can be informed by any number of weights, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">register pressure</a>, individual instruction
performance (clock cycles, use of shared units), and feature availability
(e.g., selecting an older version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a>
to be compatible with more CPUs).</p>

<p>In this approach, the steganographer would control the compiler and its instruction selection
weights, encoding information in particular selections of instructions (or other parts of
code generation, like stack object order).</p>

<p>This affords a great deal of flexibility and control, but also makes it more difficult for the
compiler to perform optimal selections. It also requires the steganographer to maintain
their (forked) compiler. Not a bad idea, but requires a decent amount of effort.</p>

<h3 id="instrumenting-the-container-format">Instrumenting the container format</h3>

<p>Another approach is to ignore the compiled instructions themselves, and focus on the binary
container: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O">Mach-O</a>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable">PE</a>, among others.</p>

<p>These formats afford many opportunities for embedding information: the order
(both file and virtual address) of segments and sections, the order and layout
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_(computing)">relocation tables</a> and the composition of
their internal rules, and so on.</p>

<p>Instrumenting the binary format rather than the executable code means not having
to muck with instruction selection, but is also less bountiful in terms of
information density. It’s also not portable, e.g. tricks for hiding information
in ELF relocation entries would have to be tweaked for PEs.</p>

<h2 id="how-steg86-works">How <em>steg86</em> works</h2>

<p>Instead of controlling instruction selection or tweaking the details of the containing binary
format, <em>steg86</em> takes a third route: it uses the presence of <em>semantic duals</em> in the x86 and AMD64
instruction formats to selectively rewrite a program <em>after</em> compilation.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-duals">Semantic duals</h3>

<p>Like every ISA, x86 (and AMD64) have multiple ways to encode the semantics of a particular
(higher level, conceptual) operation. For example, clearing a register:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>; xor'ing a register with itself clears all bits</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>eax</span>

<span>; and'ing a register with 0 also clears all bits</span>
<span>and</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>

<span>; we could also set 0</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>

<span>; ...or subtract</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>eax</span>

<span>; ...or load a "computed" address that's always 0</span>
<span>lea</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…among many others. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work exactly as we’d like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each of these alternatives may have a different length when encoded, e.g. 2 bytes for
<code>xor eax, eax</code> versus 6 for <code>lea eax, [0]</code>. Consequently, rewriting one in terms of another
might entail a length change and subsequent relocation and displacement fixups.</li>
  <li>Each of these alternatives has subtle microarchitectural differences: they set and clear
different arithmetic flags, have different implicit segmentation behavior, and so on.
We don’t know perfectly whether the original operations took advantage of those details,
so many of our potential alternatives run the risk of subtle breakage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, this is <strong>not</strong> what <em>steg86</em> does.</p>

<p>Instead, <em>steg86</em> takes advantage of one of the quirks of the x86 instruction encoding: the ModR/M
byte:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/modrm.png" alt="The ModR/M byte."></p>

<p>The ModR/M byte is normally used to encode one or more explicit register and/or memory operands
to an opcode<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>: it’s how x86 can supply the rich range of source-to-sink modes that it has
(register-to-memory, memory-to-register, register-to-register, immediate-to-register, &amp;c).</p>

<p>Because register-to-memory and memory-to-register are both valid source-sink combinations for
many opcodes, many have encoding forms like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>; xor register with register/memory32 and store register/memory32</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>r</span><span>/</span><span>m32</span><span>,</span> <span>r32</span>

<span>; xor register/memory32 with register and store register</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>r32</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>/</span><span>m32</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Consequently, there are actually <strong>two</strong> ways to encode <code>xor eax, eax</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>; r/m32, r
31 C0

; r, r/m32
33 C0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These encodings are <em>semantic duals</em>: they have different opcodes, but belong to the same
instruction family, have the same length, and have the <em>exact same behavior and performance</em>.
We could replace every occurrence of <code>31 C0</code> with <code>33 C0</code> and our programs would happily chug along,
none the wiser.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there are actually quite a few of these duals on some of the most common
x86 instructions<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ADD r/m8, r8   &lt;=&gt; ADD r8, r/m8

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each dual represents one bit of information: we can arbitrarily assign one form
to be <code>true</code> and its counterpart to be <code>false</code>. Given enough of them in a target
program, we can hide a message by translating between the forms. The result:
a binary that’s exactly the same size as the original and with the same performance
characteristics, but with a hidden message.</p>

<p>That’s all <em>steg86</em> does: it locates every semantic dual in its target program, maps
its input message to a bitstring, and translates each dual depending on its corresponding
message bit. Because it only uses duals, it’s completely agnostic to its containing format:
the <code>steg86</code> CLI currently supports ELF, Mach-O, and PE/PE32+ binaries.</p>

<p>Here’s what that actually looks like, with (some of the) differing bytes highlighted in red:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/steg86_vbindiff.png" alt="vbindiff between bash and steg'd bash"></p>

<p>And, of course, try it for yourself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>steg86 profile /bin/bash
Summary <span>for</span> /bin/bash:
  175828 total instructions
  27957 potential semantic pairs
  27925 bits of information capacity <span>(</span>3490 bytes, approx. 3KB<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>steg86 embed /bin/bash test.steg <span>&lt;&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"hello world!"</span>
<span>$ </span>file test.steg

<span>$ </span>steg86 extract test.steg
hello world!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/steg86/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for prior work and
future refinements to <em>steg86</em>’s informational capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: An important note: because compilers and assemblers tend to select just one of the forms
above, <em>steg86</em> <strong>cannot</strong> provide deniability, even with strong encryption. Its transformations
will always look abnormal compared to a compiler-produced binary.</p>

            <h3>Body Weight Has Surprising, Alarming Impact on Brain Function</h3> 
			<h4>Higher BMI is linked to decreased cerebral blood flow, which is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and mental illness, according to a new study in JAD</h4>		</p><div> 
						            		
						<p>
							<em>August 5, 2020</em><br>
							<strong>Amsterdam, NL and Costa Mesa, CA, USA – As a person's weight goes up, all regions of the brain go down in activity and blood flow, according to a <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200655" target="_blank">new brain imaging study</a> in the <em><a href="http://j-alz.com/" target="_blank">Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</a></em>. One of the largest studies linking obesity with brain dysfunction, scientists analyzed over 35,000 functional neuroimaging scans using single-photon emission computerized tomography from more than 17,000 individuals to measure blood flow and brain activity. </strong>
						</p><p>Low cerebral blood flow is the #1 brain imaging predictor that a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease. It is also associated with depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, addiction, suicide, and other conditions. “This study shows that being overweight or obese seriously impacts brain activity and increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease as well as many other psychiatric and cognitive conditions,” explained Daniel G. Amen, MD, the study’s lead author and founder of Amen Clinics, one of the leading brain-centered mental health clinics in the United States</p>

<p>Striking patterns of progressively reduced blood flow were found in virtually all regions of the brain across categories of underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity, and morbid obesity. These were noted while participants were in a resting state as well as while performing a concentration task. In particular, brain areas noted to be vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease, the temporal and parietal lobes, hippocampus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and precuneus, were found to have reduced blood flow along the spectrum of weight classification from normal weight to overweight, obese, and morbidly obese.</p>

<p>Considering the latest statistics showing that 72% of Americans are overweight of whom 42% are obese, this is distressing news for America’s mental and cognitive health.</p>
<p>Commenting on this study, George Perry, PhD, Editor-in-Chief of the <em>Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease</em> and Semmes Foundation Distinguished University Chair in Neurobiology at The University of Texas at San Antonio, stated, “Acceptance that Alzheimer’s disease is a lifestyle disease, little different from other age-related diseases, that is the sum of a lifetime is the most important breakthrough of the decade. Dr. Amen and collaborators provide compelling evidence that obesity alters blood supply to the brain to shrink the brain and promote Alzheimer’s disease. This is a major advance because it directly demonstrates how the brain responds to our body.”</p>
<p>This study highlights the need to address obesity as a target for interventions designed to improve brain function, be they Alzheimer disease prevention initiatives or attempts to optimize cognition in younger populations. Such work will be crucial in improving outcomes across all age groups.</p>
<p>Although the results of this study are deeply concerning, there is hope. Dr. Amen added, “One of the most important lessons we have learned through 30 years of performing functional brain imaging studies is that brains can be improved when you put them in a healing environment by adopting brain-healthy habits, such as a healthy calorie-smart diet and regular exercise.”</p>

<p>The original AKAI MPC 3000 Classic released in 1994 as the step up from its predecessor, the MPC 60 (and the later MPC 60 mkII). MSRP was staggering, coming in at just under $4,000 in the early 90’s (a little over $7,000 in today’s money). It was clear that this machine was meant for professional studios and intended to be a tool for deliberate music applications.</p>

<p>The black AKAI MPC 3000 LE is a limited edition release of only 2000 individually numbered units in the year 2000. </p>



<p>There is a rumor that only 1400 units have been released to the public because as far as we know, the public has not seen any units numbered 1400 through 2000. Let it be known if you have one of these rare units.</p>

<h2>History of the AKAI MPC 3000</h2>



<h3>Roger Linn</h3>



<p>In 1980 Roger Linn designed and released the worlds first drum machine that uses samples called the LM-1, under his own company Linn Moffett Electronics with then partner Alex Moffett. Eventually Linn Electronics went out of business and the next chapter would be Roger Linn and Akai Professional linking up to create new products. The collaboration was a good fit because Akai needed a creative designer and Roger Linn wasn’t a fan of the manufacturing aspects of the business. In 1988 they would release the Akai MPC 60 and later followed by the updated MPC 60 MKII. In 1994 came the release of the MPC 3000, the celebrated upgrade from the MPC 60 line.</p>



<h3>MPC 60 vs MPC 3000</h3>



<ul><li>MPC 60: 12 bit audio – MPC 3000: 16 bit audio.</li><li>MPC 60 has 750KB of stock memory, expandable to 1.5 MB. The MPC 3000 has 2 MB of stock memory, expandable up to 32 MB.</li><li>The MPC 60 only has a single mono sampling input, while the MPC 3000 has dual stereo inputs.</li><li>MPC 60 has no filters whle the MPC 3000 comes equipped with a lowpass filter.</li><li>Both sound slightly different from eachother. Some prefer the 60, others prefer the 3000.</li></ul>



<p>Roger Linn’s vision for what a drum machine could be revolved around <em>grooves</em>. A drum machine had to have great groove to it. So he wanted it to be simple and be able to record exactly what you threw at it. This required the timing to be super tight in the MPC 3000. Linn made sure all the details were figured out for this on the backend and the result is a machine that grooves perfectly.</p>

</div><figcaption>Roger Linn talks about the AKAI MPC 3000.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hip-hop took an immediate kinship to the machine. Early notable users were producers like DJ Quik, Battlecat, Dr. Dre and J DIlla. The creation of the drum machine sampler ushered in innovation to a musical artform that was previously based around two turntables. The innovation of the sampler elevated the artform to a new frontier. Roger Linn himself has said that he did not anticipate this.</p>



<blockquote><p><em><span><b>”The AKAI MPC simultaneously </b></span><strong>digitized beat-making, progressed the pastiche musical form, and freed Hip-Hop from the confines of earlier technology.”</strong></em></p><cite><a href="https://happymag.tv/in-praise-of-the-akai-mpc-a-hip-hop-time-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HappyMag.Tv</a></cite></blockquote>



<h3>J Dilla</h3>



<p>J Dilla started to make a name for himself in the mid 90’s with classic records like Pharcyde’s “Runnin”, Janet Jackson’s “Got Til It’s Gone”, and Q-Tip’s “Breathe &amp; Stop”.</p>

<p>Out of Dilla’s music also spawned the R&amp;B sub-genre Neo-soul. Also connected to the MPC 3000 through J Dilla’s work.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that nobody else has displayed the MPC 3000’s groove capablities better than J Dilla. He was turning off the quantize setting during a time when literally everybody was relying on quantization for electronic music creation. He approached the MPC 3000 like a drummer would, and in turn he is regarded as one of the best drum programmers of all time.</p>

<h3>Dr. Dre</h3>



<p>After the release of the landscape-changing album <em>The Chronic 2001</em> in 1999 by Dr. Dre, more of the public started to take strong notice of the machine. Dr. Dre stated in an interview with Scratch Magazine that he used four or five different MPC 3000’s at one time for the creation of the album to avoid the drawbacks of using disks and memory. He shared that during this time his beats were layed down with the drums in the 3000 first, and everything else revolving around that.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts About the MPC 3000</h2>



<ul><li>There are no visual waveforms. You chop on the MPC 3000 with numbers, editing the start and end time of samples with numerical digits. Others would argue that you can chop by individually sampling each chop.</li><li>There is no EQ or FX in the MPC 3000. Only a lowpass filter and attack/decay, and delay.</li><li>You can only cutoff 2 other pads per pad. Compare this with modern drum machines where you can apply choke groups, etc. and cutoff any pad.</li></ul>



<h2>Why The MPC 3000 Is The Best Drum Machine of All Time</h2>



<p>To put it plainly, the simplicity.</p>



<p>Even though technically an MPC is a computer, the ushering in of personal computers as we know them today, and the fast innovation simply changed how music was being made. Workflow started to shift from unmanageably short sample times to hoards of collections of samples on hard drives. Modern workflow now allows freely auditioning any sized samples and endless decisions to be made with endless tools at your fingertips, effectively debilitating creativity very easily.</p>



<p>If Roger Linn had not been the first to incorporate sampling into drum machines, and then successfuly iterate on it leading into the release of the 3000, its safe to say that Hip-Hop and House music would not have taken it under their wing and catapulted the machine into the history books in the way that its heralded as a classic machine and musical instrument.</p>



<p>When you take a step back, its easy to realize that the 3000 was really where things peaked for drum machines. The MPC 3000 knocked it out of the park where it mattered most…. The sound, the timing, and the workflow. Drum machines that came after the MPC 3000 started to offer new abilities and functions, but traded them for things like the beefy analog sound and streamlined workflow.</p>



<p><strong>The Timing</strong></p>



<p>When you talk to fans of the MPC 3000, you hear them talk about “The Feel.” They will tell you that the feel of the 3000 is like no other drum machine or sampler that exists. This is due to the timing that Roger Linn built into the machine. The timing on the MPC 3000 is extremely tight and about as true as you can get. It will record exactly what you play. Essentially, it is the essense of what a “groovebox” is.<br>The sequencer on the MPC 3000 is second to none.</p>



<p><strong>The Sound</strong></p>



<p>Theres something about the sound of the MPC 3000. It’s the sampling engine, but it also seems to be more than that. For drums, while subtle… enthusiasts will tell you its unmatched. While the sampling engine will color sounds in its own way, the 3000 also seems to have a unique glue which provides subtle punch. Sounds will jump off of the track and manage to coexist beautifully on the 3000.</p>



<p><em>The low end on the MPC 3000 is amazing.</em></p>



<p>The MPC 3000 is very bottom heavy and thick in sound. Roger Linn has talked about how they tried to make it sound like a tape machine. And it clearly does. You can drive this machine extremely hot and loud without ever losing any bottom end.</p>



<p>You can’t really get a computer or any DAW to sound like an MPC 3000. Some claim its a matter of boosting the low end, and cutting some of the high end frequencies to match the sound of the 3000. This is simply false. There are much more nuances happening that have yet to be achieved on a computer… mostly the digitial to analog conversion. The DAC on the MPC 3000 is extremely unique. It’s a machine and it sounds like a machine, in a good way. In the best way possible.</p>



<p><strong>The Workflow</strong></p>



<p>The workflow is unmatched. It’s minimal, but it also gives you the proper buttons for only the functions and screens that you need. </p>



<p>The addition of a number pad is brilliant and is extremely useful allowing …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A question I often hear from teams - both new and established - is “should we host our stack on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>?”.  Given all the buzz it gets in the tech world a lot of people assume&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with k8s for several years - often with very powerful and complex platforms - and I think the truth is more&nbsp;nuanced.</p>
<p>Here’s my attempt at untangling that decision.  It’s geared toward startups and self-sufficient teams in wider organisations with responsibility for hosting their own products.  It might also have value to people in more traditional <span>IT</span> departments at larger&nbsp;organisations.</p>
<h3>How Can it Help&nbsp;Me?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t just a 2018-era buzzword.  It’s a robust, highly scalable system that allows you to construct application deployments out of well-considered primitives (<code>Pod</code>, <code>Service</code>, <code>Ingress</code> etc) then does its damnedest to make the reality match.  When applications crash it restarts them.  When whole swathes of underlying machines disappear it tries to replace them.  If you’re running numerous services (probably developed as a microservice architecture) and you’re looking for efficiency, resilience and a good story for deployment it can do a lot for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Want a basic degree of resilience in your service? (yes you do) - run <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/">multiple replicas</a> in your deployment then balance traffic between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>If your workload is ‘bursty’ (e.g. a lot of <span>API</span> traffic) you could build on this by rigging up <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/">autoscaling</a> to grow capacity when it’s needed.  This can save you a lot of money - instead of paying for peak capacity all of the time, provision a baseload amount to keep the platform ticking over and bring up more replicas when they’re needed.  And if you can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/custom-and-external-metrics">import the queue length</a> into your system autoscaling works for queue-based workloads&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Worried about your code breaking?  Configure liveness/readiness <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">probes</a> and Kubernetes will automatically restart your services when they fail.  Likewise for hardware failure - I’ve seen clusters who’ve lost half their nodes keep on trucking like nothing happened.  A well-configured and maintained Kubernetes cluster can be incredibly robust.  If you have the resources you might even try running a <a href="https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/">chaos-monkey</a>-like <a href="https://www.gremlin.com/chaos-monkey/chaos-monkey-alternatives/kubernetes/">tool</a> to make certain your stack will tolerate regular&nbsp;failures.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has excellent features for integrating with your <span>CI</span> workflow.  The most common pattern I see for this is a build (ideally standardised across all your projects) that pushes an image to a Docker registry then kicks your k8s cluster to load it.  Depending on taste that can be done by modifying the deployment to pull a new tag, or pointing the tag to the new image and triggering k8s to reload all pods.  In most cases (migrations ruin everything) deployment can be fully automated: if you trust your tests and feature flags it can be 100% automatic (aka <a href="https://www.continuousdelivery.com/">Continuous Delivery</a>); for the less brave a manual approval step after the build eases the pain.  Either way your developers should be able to release most builds to the cluster without any help from Kubernetes&nbsp;specialists.</p>
<p>In a similar vein to <span>CI</span> it can help you standardise logging and monitoring for your applications.  Doing this is by no means unique to Kubernetes, but having a single cluster-wide system that gathers together data about all your services in the same place can greatly ease the pain of debugging.  I’ve seen particularly good results come from using <a href="https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset">fluentd</a> to pipe json-structured logging output from applications into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/"><span>AWS</span> CloudWatch</a> and query it through <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html">Insights</a>.</p>
<p>Finally it can do a great deal to increase efficiency - both at the hosting layer (i.e. jamming as many applications onto those expensive <span>EC2</span> instances as possible) and also reducing the time your developers need to spend deploying software.  Humans cost more than computers so for most organisations the second of these will be the biggest win.  But Kubernetes isn’t magic - I’ve seen some beautiful, efficient clusters and some total gas guzzlers.  <em>You’ll only save money with Kubernetes if you invest in using it&nbsp;correctly.</em></p>
<h3>Where Does Kubernetes&nbsp;Shine?</h3>
<p>First of all think about your workload.  What kind of applications do you need to run?  How do they talk to each other and the outside world?  From experience I’d say the following attributes make your stack a good&nbsp;fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadly speaking have you followed a microservice architecture?  There’s little value in Kubernetes if your world only has one application.  You’ll need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/">Dockerize</a> your applications to deploy them to k8s; doing this from day 1 of any project is a good way to make yourself think about the boundaries between&nbsp;services.</li>
<li>Are your services exposed to each other and the outside world via <span>HTTP</span>(s) (probably yes, it’s 2020)?  This will fit k8s’ model nicely and you can use one of the normal <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controllers</a> to front&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Are your applications suitable to be load balanced?  No local state (use PostgreSQL / Redis / whatever for that), communication over known endpoints, fast startup/shutdown.  That isn’t to say you can’t keep shortlived state like a Redis cache in your cluster but for many cases you’d do better to use the boxed services a cloud provider&nbsp;offers.</li>
<li>Kubernetes is also well suited to headless applications like batch processing (through its <code>Job</code> <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/">controller</a>) and long-lived&nbsp;queue-consumers.</li>
<li>Is memory (and to a lesser extent <span>CPU</span>) usage predictable?  Kubernetes will try to host your applications on the same physical machines, so if one of them goes haywire and consumes all the <span>RAM</span> other workloads may be randomly killed.  In my experience this is the single biggest source of instability on Kubernetes clusters.  If you understand the resource usage of your applications you can declare a <code>resources.requests</code> and <code>resources.limits</code> to guarantee they’ll always get the memory they need and won’t be bad&nbsp;neighbours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely here are a few kinds of workload I <em>don’t</em> think you should use it&nbsp;for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static websites.  Typically you’d do this by baking your content into an <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/">Nginx</a>-derived image and exposing it via your cluster’s ingress controller.  That’s a terrible way to host static content: all those little copies of Nginx need to be maintained, it’s inefficient and far less resilient / performant than it could be at the network level.  Sure you could stick it behind a <span>CDN</span> but if you’re doing that, why not have a cloud service host the content as&nbsp;well?</li>
<li>Hosting untrusted code.  That could mean applications supplied by your customers or third party code with a history of security problems, e.g. Wordpress or a dodgy library from <span>NPM</span>.  By default Kubernetes’ features for isolating workloads aren’t great.  You can add things like <a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/">Calico</a> to control network access but it’s easy to screw up and your security model is always going to be 100% dependent on the container runtime.  The default for this (Docker, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">Linux cgroups</a>) offers a huge attack surface to compromised applications: if a codebase your cluster is running gets hacked an attacker will not find it hard to escalate their access to the rest of the cluster.  Interesting work is being doing on alternatives to cgroups (e.g. <a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a>) but it’s not yet mainstream enough to recommend to the average&nbsp;user.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your workload isn’t a good fit you may still have options for shoehorning it into Kubernetes (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/">volumes</a> can be used for long-lived state), but expect to spend a lot of engineering time working around the problems.  A lot of them are bad practices anyhow so your resources time might be better spent designing them out of the stack altogether - they’re only going to hurt you further down the&nbsp;line.</p>
<h3>No Magic&nbsp;Bullet</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t a magic bullet.  It can help to move the complexities of hosting applications into a well-designed layer of their own but it won’t make them go away.  You’re always going to have to secure and maintain your&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>To make a cluster useful for the average workload a menagerie of add-ons will be required.  Some of them almost everyone uses, others are somewhat niche.  Examples include (the Nginx <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controller</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">cert-manager</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler">cluster-autoscaler</a> to add extra nodes when you don’t have enough capacity.  Having a bespoke set of software operating key features of the environment makes your cluster a unique snowflake and it needs to be managed as such.  Also they need to be updated regularly and can sometimes be of questionable quality.  Configuration management tools like <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> or <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs">Terraform</a> are nigh-on mandatory: tinker with a cluster by hand at your peril, absent a declarative setup you’ll never be able to spin up another in exactly the same way.  I’ve seen this lead to no end of problems when operating or replacing more mature&nbsp;clusters.</p>
<p>When running any nontrivial stack on Kubernetes a degree of curation is always going to be required.  Letting anybody deploy whatever they like, however they like to your cluster can only lead to chaos.  You’ll end up with mess of inconsistently named applications scattered across dozens (or worse, one) namespaces with nobody knowing how they fit together.  Congratulations: you took your old spaghetti infrastructure and replaced it with a new flavour of spaghetti infrastructure, just served on a cooler kind of&nbsp;plate.</p>
<p>The most successful Kubernetes implementations I’ve seen are those where infrastructure specialist(s) work with developers to make sure workloads are well-configured, standardised, protected from one another and have defined patterns of communication.  They’ll handle the initial setup of an application on an infrastructure, hopefully wired up to a build/release system so dev teams can ship new versions of the code without help.  In a lot of ways this mirrors the wider culture of your organisation - if engineering is a chaotic free-for-all of bad communication and ill-defined responsibilities your hosting environment will mirror it.  At best this leads to unreliability; at worst an unreliable, unmaintainable, expensive&nbsp;mess.</p>
<h3>Cost of&nbsp;Ownership</h3>
<p>If you’re running applications on a large scale …</p></div></div>

          <section>
            <p>On our journey to true zero carbon hosting we want to explore if the world is ready for the next step: low power computing resources based on ARM.</p>

<p>For this reason we started this crowdfunding campaign that lasts 30 days and you can make an impact by choosing ARM or Intel for running your workload.</p>

<p>If only 50 people decide to go for ARM, we will build a new ARM hosting in our Zero Carbon Data Center here in Switzerland.</p>

<h2>Dedicated ARM computing</h2>

<p>We would like to take the next step and introduce <em>dedicated ARM compute resources</em>. Initially the offer will be for a Quad (4) core systems featuring 2 GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (microSD, class 10). These systems are using very little power and could shape the way how hosting is offered.</p>

<p>Using ARM, you will get a real, physical hardware instead of virtualised resources. The CPU will be based on the Allwinner A64 SoC running at 400 Mhz.</p>

<p>The choice of operating systems will be adjusted to ARM. Planned are Armbian, Arch Linux, Alpine Linux and NetBSD. More are likely to follow.</p>

<h2>The classic Intel/x86 way</h2>

<p>This crowdfunding also works as a vote. 
Do you prefer staying on x86_64, Intels 64 bit technology or do you want to switch to ARM?
While x86 is proven and virtualisation also helps to be energy efficient, the general design of x86 CPUs is more performance orientated and thus by design requiring more energy.</p>

<p>The choice of operating systems for the x86 VMs is the same ones as listed on <a href="https://datacenterlight.ch/">DataCenterLight.ch</a>.</p>

<h2>The offer</h2>

<p>If you can choose freely, what would you buy? We would love to know! We have created the following 4 offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dedicated IPv6 Only ARM, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB microsd storage for 159.5 CHF/year</li>
<li>Dedicated IPv6 ARM with dedicated NAT64 mapped IPv4 address, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB microsd storage for 258.5 CHF/year</li>
<li>IPv6 only x86 VM, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 10 GB CEPH SSD for 170.5 CHF/year</li>
<li>Dual Stack x86 VM, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 10 GB CEPH SSD for 269.5 CHF/year</li>
</ul>

<p>(all prices excluding VAT where applicable)</p>

<h2>Conditions</h2>

<p>If at least 50 people commit to ARM resources, we will setup dedicated ARM hosting in 2020. 
The one who participate in this crowdfunding campaign will be the first to get their hands on ARM resources.
ARM resources </p>

<p>If less than 50 people commit on ARM, all dedicated ARM servers will be refunded and no ARM infrastructure will be established in the Data Center Light.</p>

<p>The x86 based resources will be setup independently of whether or not the goal of ARM servers is reached. You can see real time on this crowdfunding page who is in favor for which technology.</p>

<h2>Get in touch with us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or would like to discuss the ARM offer, we welcome you in our <a href="https://chat.with.ungleich.ch/">Open Chat</a>. You can also reach us by mail at support -at- ungleich.ch.
You can also checkout the <a href="https://ungleich.ch/">ungleich homepage</a> and the <a href="https://datacenterlight.ch/">Data Center Light hosting</a>.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/fridge.jpg"></p>

<p>I had acquired all of the film one day when my printer sent me an email asking if I wanted to purchase 93 packs of Fujifilm FP-100c for 2,790.- CHF. That’s 30.- CHF per box, about three times what this film used to retail for and about one third of what it currently sells for<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. So I thought about the offer for five minutes, then said yes.</p>

<p>I figured I could sell half of the packs and recoup my costs, after various expenses, then I would have around 45 boxes that I could shoot a photo project with. So I picked the film up and thanked my printer. He even included the above fridge, three Polaroid cameras, and a bunch of accessories for free. So whichever way I spin this, even if a few packs went missing in the post, I would still be close to doubling my investment <em>at the least</em> if I decided to sell all the film. Not bad.</p>

<p>The film had been discontinued, at least announced to be, in early 2016. The film was still available on a wholesale level up until sometime in 2018 so people had started stockpiling it and the prices inevitably went up. The problem with photographic film is that it will start go off in a few years as the chemicals break down, so it needs to be cold stored. This is especially the case with instant film as there are chemicals not just to record the image but also the entire development process is included in each frame.</p>

<p><strong>Instant Film</strong></p>

<p>There’s a market for this stuff as there is a range of old cameras and backs for other cameras that can only function with it. The film comes in dedicated plastic packs that the cameras/backs are designed to work with. You load a pack, fiddle about a bit, and you are ready to shoot. Like other instant films you take the shot, pull out the frame, give it a minute or two, then “peel apart” the frame to reveal the image.</p>

<p>The film can still be bought “new” on auction sites, some analog specific photography stores, and private sellers; but all of the film is now expired as the last batch was marked to do so in early 2019, so there’s a risk involved in any purchase of this film if you want it “fresh”. To purchase a single box of the film from one of the last batches you should expect to pay around 100.- CHF. Ten times what it originally retailed for.</p>

<p>Given there are ten frames in each box, and due to the fickle nature of the cameras that shoot this type of film you can often lose one or even two frames due to mechanical or exposure issues, you’re paying in the region of 12.- CHF <em>per photo</em>.</p>

<p>This is not a case of having to learn how to load and use the film - sometimes you just have bad luck. The paper mechanism used to pull out the shot frame and prepare the next sometimes tears. Just last week I was using some and the first frame leader from the box tore, I had to open the camera to retrieve the next leader and lost another three frames in the process. Somehow the third frame managed to hide amongst the rest and turned up again between the 6th and the 7th frame, something I’ve not experienced before.</p>

<p>This is not fun, it’s quite ridiculous, and if I’m being honest I don’t see the point of this stuff and find it all very annoying. I say that as someone who is steeped in the film process. Sure I understand the aesthetic and the tangible nature of the process, but that’s not for me. I mean, if you really want to shoot it that’s fine, but at this price point I would now prefer to <a href="https://leejo.github.io/projects/bergbahnen/polaroids/">emulate it</a>, at least when the reason to do so is to have some sort of contextual point for the aesthetic. Each to their own of course.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/freezer.jpg"></p>

<p>Anyway, Fuji have got form with this. I’ve been using some of their film stocks for close to two decades so have seen product lines come and go, and my other fridge/freezer (above) contains some of those products that I do continue to use. Of course you can still purchase some of the discontinued film if you really want to. A few of those I use or used to are detailed below, and this is in no way an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_discontinued_photographic_films#Fujifilm">exhaustive list</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Neopan 1600</strong> - A mid to high speed black and white film that had a grain structure that I haven’t seen in other films. I used this quite a bit when shooting skate photos but it was never available in formats larger than 35mm so I stopped when I moved exclusively to medium format. You see this now and then for sale, but it won’t be good to shoot as it’s <em>at least</em> a decade expired and mid-high speed film doesn’t last more than a few years after expiry unless it’s frozen; and of course you can’t guarantee the storage history.</p>

<p>I have seen this selling for 30 to 50.- CHF for a <em>single</em> roll of 35mm, or 250.- CHF for ten packs. That’s five to ten times its original retail price.</p>

<p><strong>Fuji Fortia</strong> - a once/twice off colour slide film that was released around 2005. It was like Fuji’s Velvia 50 (detailed below) but with even more saturated reds. There were rumours that it was a batch of Velvia that didn’t pass quality control, so Fuji sold it as a special edition for the cherry blossom season in Japan. It was available for a couple of years so probably just a single run, which does backup the “it was a messed up Velvia batch” rumor.</p>

<p>You see rolls of this for sale now and then, with the price approaching ten times what it originally retailed for. This was available in medium format so I did shoot it and you can see what I mean about the saturation from the image below, which I actually had to <em>desaturate</em> a little in post as it was just too much.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/2008_poppies_cambs.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Acros 100</strong> - Another Fuji speciality, a medium to slow speed black and white film that offered four selling points: extremely fine grain for its box speed (100 ISO), very contrasty in normal development, very sharp, and very good reciprocity failure rates. You can shoot exposures up to several minutes long with little adjustment required, which may well be unique amongst all film stocks.</p>

<p>This was discontinued a couple of years ago but then came back as Acros II, however it is no longer Fuji manufacturing it and I believe it is a co-operation with Ilford<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This is probably a good thing, however the 4x5 version of the film is not being made and luckily I stocked up on this a few months before its original discontinuation was announced so I have enough to last me for a few years at least. I am using this film for a specific project, which is why I bought a few boxes; my current count is 12 remaining, that’s 240 frames.</p>

<p>I rarely see this for sale in its 4x5 version, and those I do see tend to not be from the final batches, which had expiry dates of 2019-10. This was selling for about 70.- CHF a box when it was available and I suspect those final batch boxes would go for at least twice that now.</p>

<p><strong>Velvia 50</strong> - The classic landscape (and Formula 1?<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>) photographer’s slide film. Very popular up until around, I dunno, 2005? It’s still going, but i suspect will be discontinued soon. It’s no longer available outside Japan in large format sizes, and Fuji have cut down on the number of options for it in smaller sizes. Also of note is that when I was stockpiling it the boxes had very short expiry dates, less than a year, suggesting that sales have slumped. Since then the price in Japan has gone up 50% so it’s no longer a compelling option.</p>

<p>I still shoot this, but it’s very fickle. It needs graduated neutral density filters in many cases (which I don’t have) and suffers from terrible reciprocity failure and very easy over/under exposure even if you know what you’re doing. You often have to bracket your exposures +/- a stop, which is not cheap when shooting large format film. When you get it right you understand why it was number one it its niche, again another shot that I had to pull back the saturation:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/fuji/lac_leman_2019.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>What Does This All Mean</strong></p>

<p>Discontinued film stocks are selling for twice to ten times their original retail price, so should you invest in film? Nah, not at all. Unless you discover a batch of Fuji FP-100c that’s been cold stored, is from 2018 or 2019, and selling at less than 40.- CHF a box, in which case go for it and double your investment. Clearly there is a market for discontinued photographic film emulsions, but they’re a niche within a niche and we’re now down to the products that don’t offer a unique selling point.</p>

<p>The discontinuation of the above stocks doesn’t mean much, really - you can just switch to another stock and adjust as necessary. Yeah it’s frustrating at first, but that’s the nature of film. The issue with Fuji FP-100c being discontinued is that it also renders an entire range (and more) of cameras unusable<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. There are no other options, or at least limited options, to continue using the cameras<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>That’s what’s kind of sad about this entire thing, although I guess that is the end state of all technology designed around using refills to function. Printers, things with fixed internal batteries, liquid fuel vehicles, SodaStreams? There’s more of these than you think. We will still have 35mm film for a long time I suspect, and 120 and 4x5 and 8x10 and so on; but some of the more niche products are approaching obsolescence and thus unavailability. We can retrofit some of the technology that require these refills, but eventually the expense isn’t worth it.</p>

<p>My reasons for shooting film are because it gives me access to alternative formats and some technical controls that I can’t get elsewhere, at least not at an affordable price point<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. Movements, a square or panoramic frame, an alternative way to interact with my subjects. An interesting observation about instant film is the reaction to it, compared to shooting a digital image that is effectively the same. The tangible nature of the process really is a hook.</p>

<p><em><strong>An Iverson ghost is an embedding of APL like array programming features in nonAPL languages and tools.</strong></em></p>
<p>You would be surprised at how often Iverson ghosts appear. Whenever programmers are challenged with processing large numeric arrays they rediscover bits of APL. Often they’re unaware of the rich heritage of array processing languages but in <code>NumPy's</code>&nbsp;case, they <em>indirectly</em> acknowledged the debt. In <a href="http://numpy.sourceforge.net/numdoc/numdoc.pdf"><em>Numerical Python</em></a> the authors wrote:</p>
<p><em>“The languages which were used to guide the development of NumPy include the infamous APL family of languages, Basis, MATLAB, FORTRAN, S and S+, and others.”</em></p>
<p>I consider “infamous” an upgrade from <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/ewd498.html">“a mistake carried through to perfection.”</a></p>
<p>Not only do developers frequently conjure up Iverson ghosts. They also invariably turn into little apostles of array programming that won’t shut up about how cutting down on all those goddamn loops clarifies and simplifies algorithms. How learning to think about operating on entire arrays, versus one dinky number at a time, frees the mind. Why it’s almost as if array programming <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm">is a tool of thought.</a></p>
<p>Where have I heard this before?</p>
<p>Ahh, I’ve got it, when I first encountered APL almost fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Yes, I am an old programmer, a fossil, a living relic. My brain is a putrid pool of punky programming languages. Python is just the latest in a longish line of languages. Some people collect stamps. I collect programming languages. And, just like stamp collectors have favorite stamps, I find some programming languages more attractive than others. For example, I recognize the undeniable utility of <code>C/C++</code>, for many tasks they are the only serious options, yet as useful and pervasive as <code>C/C++</code> are they have never tickled my fancy. The notation is ugly! Yeah, I said it; suck on it C people. Similarly, the world’s most commonly used programming language <code>JavaScript</code> is equally ugly. Again, <code>JavaScript</code> is so damn useful that programmers put up with its many warts. Some have even made a few bucks writing books about its <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">meager good parts</a>.</p>
<p>I have similar inflammatory opinions about other widely used languages. The one that is making me miserable now is <code>SQL</code>, particularly Microsoft’s variant&nbsp;<code>T-SQL</code>. On purely aesthetic grounds I find well-formed <code>SQL</code> queries less appalling than your average <code>C</code> pointer fest. Core <code>SQL</code> is fairly elegant but the macro programming features that have grown up around it are depraved. I feel dirty when&nbsp;forced to use them which is just about every other day.</p>
<p>At the end of my programming day, I want to look on something that is beautiful. I don’t particularly care about how useful a chunk of code is or how much money it might make, or what silly little business problem it solves. If the damn code is ugly I don’t want to see it.</p>
<p>People keep rediscovering array programming, best described in Ken Iverson’s 1962 book <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL.htm"><em>A Programming Language</em></a>, for two basic reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s an efficient way to handle an important class of problems.</li>
<li>It’s a step away from the ugly and back towards the beautiful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these reasons manifest in <code>NumPy</code>‘s resounding success in the Python world.</p>
<p>As usual, efficiency led the way. The authors of <em>Numerical Python</em> note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why are these extensions needed? The core reason is a very prosaic one, and that is that manipulating a set of a million numbers in Python with the standard data structures such as lists, tuples or classes is much too slow and uses too much space.</p></blockquote>
<p>Faced with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBAijg5Betw">“does not compute”</a> situation you can either try something else or fix what you have. The Python people fixed Python with <code>NumPy</code>. <a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-exact-difference-between-a-Pythoneer-and-a-Pythonista">Pythonistas</a> reluctantly embraced <code>NumPy</code> but quickly went <em>apostolic!</em> Now books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038481.do"><em>Elegant SciPy</em></a> and the entire <code>SciPy</code> toolset that been built on <code>NumPy</code> take it for granted.</p>
<p>Is there anything in <code>NumPy</code> for programmers that have been drinking the array processing Kool-Aid for decades? The answer is yes! <a href="http://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/NuVoc">J programmers</a>, in particular, are in for a treat with the new Python3 addon that’s been released with the latest J 8.07 beta. This addon directly supports <code>NumPy</code> arrays making it easy to swap data in and out of the J/Python environments. It’s one of those best of both worlds things.</p>
<p>The following <code>NumPy</code> examples are from the <code>SciPy.org</code> <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html">NumPy quick start tutorial</a>. For each <code>NumPy</code> statement, I have provided a J equivalent. J is a descendant of APL. It was largely designed by the same man: Ken Iverson. A scumbag lawyer or greedy patent troll might consider suing <code>NumPy</code>‘s creators after looking at these examples. APL’s influence is obvious. Fortunately, Ken Iverson was more interested in promoting good ideas that profiting from them. I suspect he would be flattered that APL has mutated and colonized strange new worlds and I think even zealous Pythonistas will agree that Python is a delightfully strange world.</p>

<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>In this episode of the “<a href="https://kislayverma.com/category/for-the-layman/">For the layman</a>” series, I am going to discuss what the “cloud” is. We’ve all heard of iCloud, AWS, cloud computing etc, and understand the power of their ubiquitous presence. Let’s understand the history and the mechanics of the Cloud a little more.</p>
<hr>
<p><span><strong>tl;dr –</strong> The Cloud is Uber for computers. It is made up of hundreds of thousands of computers (aka servers) that users can rent out to run their software in exchange for a regular fee – mostly based on usage. Cloud companies take care of running the hardware with all kinds of best practices so that software developers and software development companies don’t have to and can focus on their core work.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Have you ever seen one of those high intensity surgery scenes in movies where the doctor keeps shouting at the nurses “Give me a clamp” or “Give me 5cc of &lt;insert medicine name&gt;”? For the longest time, software development used to be like (only less high stakes for the most part). Programmers would write awesome <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">applications that could eat the world</a>. But running these awesome apps required big computers. So while the programmer finished writing the last line of code or polishing the last bit of documentation (HAHAHAHA), she would start screaming, “Give me a big computer”.</p>

<p>For many years, this meant going out and buying the computer, plugging it in, installing a bazillion things on it, and forever making sure no one pulled out the plug by mistake. I’m not even getting into the bureaucracy of procuring said computer. As companies started churning out more and more software, this got to be a real problem. With the rise of the cloud, today the application developer could herself set up a new computer with no more than a few clicks of the mouse. No fuss at all. <strong>The cloud has commoditized hardware and the operations around it.</strong></p>
<p>To understand the rise of cloud computing, let’s look a little bit at the history of computers and their use.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first programmable computer was (arguably) the one developed by Alan Turing’s team in Bletchley Park as part of the allied effort at intelligence gathering in WW2. “<strong>Programmable Computer</strong>” means that this was a machine that could be arranged to do any calculation. Configured one way, it could crack the Nazi ENIGMA code. Set up another way, it could compute the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/six-things-probably-didnt-know-pi/">value of Pi</a> to the umpy-umpth decimal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is remarkable by itself because most machines now or since do only one thing. A screwdriver, a bulldozer, an airplane, all of them do exactly one thing. Even the “swiss knife” is a collection of many machines, each for one purpose. So this “programmable computer” was a breakthrough in its own right because you could get it to do anything by programming it in different ways.</p>
<p>Anyhow, with a dazzling array of innovations in hardware and computer science, it came to be that computers became commonplace. They could be found in people’s homes, and what we know today as Silicon Valley was beginning to take shape. However, access to computers at the scale at which this new computing revolution wanted it was still not easy. You could easily buy a computer for your home or office, but buying 50 computers was still a pain. Marc Randolph recounts the story from the launch day of Netflix in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07QRVWBX2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B07QRVWBX2">That will never work</a> about how his team were constantly rushing out to buy more computers from a neighbourhood shop because of the unexpectedly large number of people visiting the website.</p>
<p>Since this buy-on-demand model did not work very well, software companies started buying and keeping computers in their office (this is still done widely and is called <strong>on-premise/on-prem</strong>). IT teams would set up the computers, power system, air conditioning, cable layouts, failsafes etc in some designated area in the office. This meant that the company always had a buffer stock of computing power at hand. The cost of this was the capital tied up in all the servers whether being used or not.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-1013x1024.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="519" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-1013x1024.jpg 1013w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-297x300.jpg 297w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-150x150.jpg 150w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-768x776.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments-1070x1081.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/on-prem-deployments.jpg 1233w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></figure></div>
<p>And you know what the sneaky software developers did (and have been doing since)? They found out that getting computers wouldn’t be so much of a pain anymore, so they started churning out even more software. Sooo much more of it. Easy supply further fuelled the hunger for computational resources.</p>

<p>The other problem for companies was that off-the-shelf computers came in certain specific sizes. Roughly speaking, <strong>a computer is made up of storage (Hard disk), computing power (CPU cores), memory (RAM) and the network (LAN/Internet)</strong>. But in the new digital age, all kinds of programs were being written which demanded each of these in different combinations. Some wanted a lot of network but didn’t do much computing (Netflix, Zoom), some stored a lot of data but didn’t have to be fast (data backup systems), and so on.</p>
<p>Most companies couldn’t afford to keep all combinations of such machines at hand. It was too expensive to buy and they would have had to keep a team of engineers for this alone. So some smart folks at IBM, the premier computing company of its time, came up with the idea of <strong>Virtualization</strong>. Virtualization allowed us to hide multiple computers and all their resources behind a curtain and think in terms of their aggregate resources. E.g. Ten 4 core computers with 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage each became a collection of 40 cores, 80 GB RAM, and 2560GB of storage which could be parcelled out into “<strong>virtual machines</strong>” as per the programmer’s requirement. e.g. All of the above mentioned resources could be combined to make 2 huge virtual machines (aka VMs) of 20 cores, 40 GB RAM, and 1280GB storage. Wide adoption of virtualization has since hidden the actual computers (aka <strong>bare metal</strong>) from the programmers view.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1024x753.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="338" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-300x220.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-768x564.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1536x1129.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization-1070x786.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtualization.jpg 1664w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>
<p>While virtualization gave organization’s huge leeway in terms of deploying computational resources efficiently, it also introduced a huge “<strong>Virtualization Layer</strong>” to the already complex stack of hundreds, sometimes thousands of computers they were running. Some companies were reaching the stage where they couldn’t house all their servers in their offices and had to open up <strong>data-centers</strong> (separate facilities for storing and operating all the servers). This was obviously a huge capital investment and distraction for these companies. They didn’t want to be in the business of running hardware, but they had no choice.</p>
<p>Around the dot com crash of the 90s, some companies (especially Amazon) had a lot of computers and expertise in operating them, and were looking to make some money. They realized that with the internet potentially connecting all computers of the world to each other, they could not only rent out their servers to people who needed to use them, but also sell their expertise in operating them reliably as a service with the hardware. This was the origin of the <strong>cloud</strong> (or <strong>cloud computing</strong> or <strong>cloud services</strong>) as we know it today.</p>
<p>The users of the cloud (the renters of the servers) essentially reach out into the Cloud to lay their hands on mostly Virtual Machines as per their computing needs without worrying about where they kept, which brand they are, and whether they are connected to the power supply or not. Cloud companies like AWS, Azure, GCP, Digital Ocean (where this blog is hosted) take care of all that so we can just focus on running the cool Facemash applications we have written. Users pay an hourly, or monthly, or some other sort of recurring charge based on their usage of these machines. No more scrambling around to buy computers, connect them etc etc. With heavy automation, today even individual developers can manage more computing power than entire teams not too long ago.</p>

<p>In the last decade, this process of cloudification has gone beyond hardware and even into the realm of software. Most cloud providers have “<strong>managed services</strong>” under which they provide well set up and maintained installations of the most commonly used software already running. We don’t even have to set up this software now – we just rent a running version of it for our own purposes -as if it was a physical thing. This is a huge blessing for startups since some of the most commonly used types of software like databases, firewalls, caches, message queues are available at only a few clicks notice and don’t have to be installed and operated. The barrier to entry in the software world has never been lower with more and more of the grunt work being moved off to the cloud.</p>
<p>Think of cloud hardware and software in terms of the “<a href="https://kislayverma.com/for-the-layman/for-the-layman-ep-1-what-is-a-distributed-system/">distributed car</a>” I had discussed in a previous article. The engine, the wheels, the fuel injection system etc are all in the cloud now, and you can have as many of them as you can pay for. As the car maker, you can now focus on your unique value addition – the branding, the interiors and leather seats, the new electric battery that only you hold the patent to, and so on.</p>
<p>Today, the cloud is part of the internet’s infrastructure like highways or schools for the real world. Most people want highways and schools as a means to an end. They don’t want to have to build them themselves. The cloud plays the same role for anyone that wants to build software. The result – omnipresent software and huge cloud provider bills 🙂</p>

	<p>Looking at Mozilla’s finances, it’s reasonable to conclude that Google is keeping them on life support to keep the anti-trust hounds at bay. Mozilla’s deal with Google will account for at least 70% of their revenues going forward. That’s over $400 million to be the default search provider in 4% of browsers. For 1 year. I’ll bet my next paycheck that Google reupped this rather generous agreement to avoid a repeat of Microsoft’s troubles over an Internet Explorer monopoly. My guess is that Google will decide it’s in their interest to pull the plug right around the time this latest wave of anti-trust talk blows over.</p>

<p>With the troubles at Mozilla, Google is one step closer to replicating the WeChat and Facebook walled-garden model on the Web. A quick survey a the field of play shows just how far Google has come in capturing the once open Web.</p>

<h2 id="browser-war-is-over">(Browser) War is over</h2>

<p>Chrome’s ability to dictate web standards will only get stronger over time. Safari and Firefox have been able to apply some shame to Chrome on things like disabling third-party cookies, but soon it’ll just be Apple left with a voice.</p>

<p>But Google doesn’t even need Chrome to dictate standards since it controls the Web’s front door. AMP, a technology no one asked for, is now on over 70% of all marketing websites for no other reason than Google said so.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget that most people now access the web via mobile devices, 75% of which run Google’s Android.</p>

<h2 id="original-sins">Original Sins</h2>

<p>Two deficiencies have determined the course the Web has taken: lack of native search and lack of native payments.</p>

<p>Lacking native distributed search allowed Google to grab a monopoly position as the entry point to the web. The Web’s orignal architects were off base on hyperlinks; it turns out people just want to skip right to the answer they’re looking for. There was once the beginnings of an alternative in public bookmarking sites, but social networks came and sucked all the air out of that space.</p>

<p>Lack of a safe and easy way of exchanging funds was a big factor in advertising becoming the dominant business model on the Web. No-charge services became the norm because, for a long time, there was no reasonable way to pay for them. Enter advertising to fill the void. I think it’s safe to say that Google’s AdWords is the dominant advertising platform on the open Web, which means it holds a commanding position in the Web’s finances.</p>

<p>I’m also going to throw in an honorable mention to poor native video support (it is hyper_text_ after all). It’s beating a dead horse to point out that Google also serves up the vast majority of videos streamed on the Web.</p>

<h2 id="so-then">So then…</h2>

<p>So Google controls the Web’s search and video infrastructure. It can and does dictate standards and media formats. It also controls a huge chunk of the revenues available when publishing and selling on the Web. It even controls the operating system and browser through which most people interact with it.</p>

<p>Google’s capture of the Web is a <em>fait accompli</em>. Only legislation will keep the World Wide Web from finally becoming Web by Google (TM).</p>

	<h4>The wisdom is that BGP is the only Datacenter protocol, but is it? Do we know?</h4>

          <p>I worked at Amazon for 17 years as a network engineer. Now I’m out of Amazon and looking at the industry, I’m learning new things. <strong>One of the things I’ve learned recently is that OSPF shouldn’t be used for Clos leaf-spine networks because of scale.</strong> I’ve heard that it can’t keep up with the size and scale of the modern datacenter networks. <a href="https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/release-independent/solutions/topics/task/configuration/ip-fabric-underlay-cloud-dc-configuring.html">Juniper IP Fabric Underlay Network Design and Implementation</a> is an example of the recommendation.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938</a> is what as used as the reference for using eBGP to be the routing protocol inside of large Clos networks.</p>

<p><strong>This is a shock to me</strong> since we built large OSPF Clos networks a decade ago. We built networks this way with hundreds of routers (even thousands) speaking OSPF. I’m not saying it is easy or that we didn’t have to understand OSPF well; If you don’t design it well, you get a flooding disaster. But if you do set it up right, it works really well. It converges quickly and doesn’t collapse under failure. The key thing is to be sure you understand how flooding works and you focus on areas and summarization. There are different things you have to be aware of when you are designing a Clos network with BGP vs OSPF. With BGP you have to be figure out how to mitigate path hunting. With OSPF need to work on how to avoid congestion collapse.</p>

<p>There is also work on building new protocols for these large Clos or Clos-like networks, such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/</a>. I don’t understand why OSPF or ISIS isn’t good enough so I don’t understand why these are necessary. There <a href="https://pc.nanog.org/static/published/meetings/NANOG74/1763/20181003_Martin_Routing_In_Dense_v1.pdf">are some good ideas in RIFT</a>, I’m just haven’t seen a reason to use it.</p>

<p>When we did this we were using CPUs from 2003 and we were using a lesser known OSPF stack. It’s OSPF implementation was okay, but we were strongly warned away from using their BGP implementation by the developers. <strong>We had to understand and mitigate risk</strong>. We had to test it as well as we could and be very careful in our first deployments. The stack had never been battle tested like this before. We still ran into some scary performance issues but got to work with great software engineers on the protocol stack to work through problems and figure out our scale.</p>

<p>Others agree with me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg</a>, even though they are mostly focusing on smaller networks than I was working on. But either way, OSPF can be made to work just fine on very large (or small) Clos networks.</p>

<p>As an example of the scale, this is a generic 24 port 3-tier Clos. It is possible to make OSPF work on this. This is smaller than what we were working on in 2012.
<img src="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/assets/images/24port-3tier-clos-resize.png" alt="24 port 3-tier clos"></p>

<p>To understand and then mitigate the risks an unknown OSPF stack, at scale, is why I started building a configuration management system and started <a href="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/Network-Validation-with-Vagrant/">simulating our network design</a>. We needed to understand how any OSPF protocol stack would work. Could we make the protocol scale at all? We needed to see what would actually happen with a real OSPF implementation. <strong>I cannot stress enough how important this simulation was.</strong> We did not understand the problem of flooding and we did not understand the solution until we had tried it out in simulation.</p>

<p>Before that, though, we spent a lot of time on white boards arguing about topology and OSPF. <strong>I think whiteboards are the most important tool for network design</strong> currently available, which makes me sad. I wish that wasn’t true, I want much better tools. I can’t even tell you the number of disasters averted by 2-3 great network engineers arguing over a whiteboard. This works really well, but there are important reasons it’s not good enough. One is that for many of these discussions, it’s extremely hard to get data to make the decisions. In this case, a comparison of convergence time and failure detection in a 3-tier Clos with eBGP, iBGP, and OSPF should be required, but we didn’t have that capability.</p>

<p>In a dense mesh-like network such as a Clos network, the concerns around OSPF swirled around four main issues: the effect of flooding, the size of the link state database, the speed of SPF calculations, and the ability for OSPF to carry a large number of prefixes. We were concerned about OSPF scaling w.r.t. its flooding and it’s the flooding that is expensive with a Link State Database protocol, not the Shortest Path First (SPF) calculations. Which means you have to be very careful about what is flooded, what are the areas, and how things are summarized. I didn’t understand this until I had a simulation and I could try things out with areas or without, and the effect was dramatic. I think it’s often true that there is a part of a design that you don’t understand, which is one of the big reasons to do simulation. We didn’t have the ability to lab up a network as big as we were going to be building, so the simulation was critical. I can’t even imagine what we would have done without it. Based on the simulation, we created targeted tests for real hardware to understand how it would deal with the scale.</p>

<p>The point of this article is not that OSPF is better than BGP, but that it does work in very large size Clos networks. I’m frustrated that so much of the industry went a direction without great data or analysis, just following one set of opinions and design choices. <strong>I wish there were easy ways for people to be able to design, simulate and test different designs</strong> like this so that they could decide for themselves the tradeoffs they’d like to make, rather than have to rely on some type of industry hype. There needs to be a better way to be able to describe topologies and designs so that it’s really easy to try out different ideas.</p>

<p>If you have other considerations, such as you want to run IPv6, or EVPN, a single instance of eBGP such as the one popularized by the open source routing suite, FRR, maybe the simplest or elegant. But with proper design, scale is not the reason to use BGP over OSPF. If you are running a small Clos network and don’t have IPv6 or EVPN, OSPF is more straightforward and generally faster, as was the common practice before the advent of BGP in the data center.</p>

<p>No matter what, you need to understand the choices that you are making and understand the tradeoffs. This is hard to do, and especially hard in networking because we lack design patterns and good tools to help us understand the implications of our choices.</p>

<p>If anybody knows about tools or design patterns or even somebody who’s actually compared OSPF vs BGP in Clos networks with data, I’d love to hear about it.</p>

        <p><span>T</span>he atmosphere is such a roiling mess that it defies analysis even by todayâ€™s most sophisticated meteorological algorithms. But its complexity didnâ€™t stop the French scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace from cracking one simple aspect of atmospheric behavior in the late 1700s. Despite never seeing a global weather map, Laplace developed a theory predicting that continent-size pressure waves would periodically sweep around the globe.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>â€œAtmospheric modeling of the pencil-and-paper kind was pretty damn crude until the 20th century, and yet Laplace managed to do this,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/people/faculty/randall/" target="_blank">David Randall</a>, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. â€œI think itâ€™s astounding.â€�</p>
<p><a href="https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/traite-de-mecanique-celeste" target="_blank">Laplaceâ€™s ideas</a>&nbsp;launched a centuries-long quest to find such waves. But the oscillations proved as gentle as they are giant, stubbornly refusing to reveal themselves even to some of the biggest names in the physical sciences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At last, the search is over. An exquisite new meteorological data set has uncovered what millions of barometer readings missed: an ensemble of waves that race around the Earth, covering it in a patchwork quilt of high- and low-pressure zones. The detection is a stunning vindication of a vintage theory.</p>
<p>â€œThis a really beautiful piece of work,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://acee.princeton.edu/directory/leo-donner/" target="_blank">Leo Donner</a>, a geophysicist at Princeton University who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p><strong>The Planetâ€™s Piano Strings</strong></p>
<p>Laplace wondered to what degree the moon gravitationally squeezes the air surrounding our planet, and he set out to analyze the types of waves that might emerge as a consequence. He imagined the atmosphere as a thin fluid on a smooth sphere, and he concluded that gravity should pin one class of waves to the ground, where they would move more or less horizontally—two-dimensional undulations that hug the planetâ€™s surface. â€œHe was really the first guy with this picture in his mind,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/users/kph/" target="_blank">Kevin Hamilton</a>, a professor emeritus at the University of Hawaiâ€˜i, MÄ�noa and co-author of the study. â€œIt was an amazing insight.â€�</p>
<p>Laplace didnâ€™t name these waves or work out their behavior in detail, but modern atmospheric scientists now describe them as â€œnormal modesâ€�—waves that resonate like the ringing of a bell. The simplest mode raises the pressure in one hemisphere and lowers it in the other. More energetic modes create checkered patterns of smaller zones of high and low pressure. They race around the globe at speeds exceeding those of most passenger planes, mainly eastward and westward.&nbsp;</p>

These four globes represent four different modes of the pressure waves. </span><br><span>T. Sakazaki and K. Hamilton, doi:10.1175/JAS-D-20-0053.1</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though Laplace started by thinking of the influence of the moon, the waves arise more from Earthâ€™s general pandemonium: Storms rage. Winds slam into mountain ranges. Turbulence stirs the pot further. Some portion of the energy from these collective abuses fires up the normal modes, which are the only tones at which the atmosphere can respond. â€œItâ€™s like a kitten walking on the keys of the piano,â€� Randall said. â€œThe random forcing can show you what strings are in the piano.â€�<br></p>
<p>Laplace put the idea into peopleâ€™s heads that such waves might exist, and his mathematics gave physicists the tools to calculate the atmosphereâ€™s tuning. But would anybody be able to hear its notes?</p>
<p>Around the same time that Laplace came out with his model, explorers and naturalists including Alexander von Humboldt noticed that pressure in the tropics rose and fell every 12 hours. The daily timing linked the changes to heating from the sun, but theorists couldnâ€™t explain why the effect was so large. The mystery continued to puzzle scientists for nearly a century, until Lord Kelvin guessed in 1882 that the sunâ€™s heating cycle resonated with one of Laplaceâ€™s â€œfree oscillations.â€� He thought that the sun could deliver an outsized push because it created vibrations at precisely the frequency of one of Laplaceâ€™s oscillations, much as an opera singer can shatter a wine glass with the right pitch. His proposition turned out to be wrong—researchers in the 1960s determined that a more complicated phenomenon amplifies the solar influence—but it spurred scientists to work out the quantitative details of Laplaceâ€™s theory and calculate exactly what frequencies the normal modes should have.<br></p>
<p>The lowest notes matching those predictions wouldnâ€™t enter the scientific record until the 1980s,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj1965/58/4/58_4_281/_article" target="_blank">first from an analysis by Taroh Matsuno</a>, a Japanese meteorologist, and&nbsp;<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JD091iD11p11867" target="_blank">later from another</a>&nbsp;by Hamilton and Rolando Garcia, now at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Hamilton and Garcia stumbled upon the ideal data set: a weather station in colonial Indonesia that carried out hourly pressure measurements over the better part of a century, missing just two readings in 79 years.</p>
<p>The record was as meticulous as it was prolonged, with researchers relying on a microscope to log shifts of mercury as fine as one-hundredth of an inch. Analyzing this and other data sets, Hamilton and Garcia were able to just make out traces of one of the longest normal modes.</p>
<p>The shorter waves seemed beyond reach until last year, when the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts released a data set called ERA5. The product blends readings from thousands of ground stations, weather balloons and satellites, and it uses weather models to intelligently fill in the blanks. The result is a data set aiming to reconstruct the same information that would have been captured by a global network of weather stations spaced every 10 kilometers and taking readings every hour from 1979 to 2016.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/50503904-Takatoshi-Sakazaki" target="_blank">Takatoshi Sakazaki</a>, an assistant professor at Kyoto University in Japan, wasnâ€™t looking for Laplaceâ€™s waves when ERA5 came out. He was initially focused on temperature variations, and he viewed the pressure peaks as unwelcome noise. But when he realized they might be normal modes, he laid them over the theoretical expectations, and voila: â€œI found they almost perfectly matched,â€� he said.</p>
<p>Sakazaki wasnâ€™t sure how significant his find was, so he reached out to Hamilton, who had been his postdoctoral research adviser, to check if the peaks might be of interest.</p>
<p>They were. Hamilton had spent decades prior to 1980 sifting through weather station data for hints of the lowest atmospheric tones. Now in his inbox he suddenly had evidence of the full symphony.</p>
<p>Sakazaki and Hamilton worked together to analyze the full three-dimensional structure of the waves in excruciating detail; they&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/jas/article/77/7/2519/347483/An-Array-of-Ringing-Global-Free-Modes-Discovered" target="_blank">published</a>&nbsp;their findings in the July 2020&nbsp;issue of the&nbsp;<em>Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences</em>. Their research details the behavior of many dozens of waves beyond the few found in the 1980s. Some of the highest-energy waves cycle from high pressure to low pressure a dozen times as they stretch around the planet; additional sets of waves get spun off by Earthâ€™s rotation. All their results precisely match predictions based on Laplaceâ€™s equations. â€œI just imagined when I saw this,â€� Hamilton said, â€œthat Laplace and Kelvin and those guys would be excited to see something like this.â€�</p>

<p>Looking at some “exciting” <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html">features landing in Python 3.8</a>, I’m still disappointed and frustrated by the language… like by quite a few other languages.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="7204" data-permalink="https://ilya-sher.org/chimpanzee-978809_640/" data-orig-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg" data-orig-size="640,640" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D7000&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0015625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="chimpanzee-978809_640" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=640" src="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=640" alt="" srcset="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg 640w, https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=150 150w, https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></div>



<p>As an author of another programming language, I can’t stop thinking about how things “should have been done” from my perspective. I want to be explicit here. My perspective is <strong>biased</strong> towards correctness and “WTF are you doing?”. Therefore, take everything here with a appropriate amount of salt.</p>



<p>Yes, not talking about any “positive” changes here.</p>



<h2>Assignment Expressions</h2>



<blockquote><p>There is new syntax <code>:=</code> that assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.</p></blockquote>



<p>A fix which couldn’t be the best because of previous design decision.</p>



<p>“Somebody” ignored the wisdom of Lisp, which was “everything is an expression and evaluates to a value” (no statements vs expressions), and made assignment a statement in Python years ago. Now this can not be fixed in a straightforward manner. It must be another syntax. Two different syntaxes for almost the same thing which is <code>=</code> for assignment as a statement and <code>:=</code> for expression assignment.</p>



<h2>Positional-only Parameters</h2>



<blockquote><p>There is a new function parameter syntax <code>/</code> to indicate that some function parameters must be specified positionally and cannot be used as keyword arguments:</p></blockquote>



<pre><code>def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f):
    print(a, b, c, d, e, f)</code></pre>



<p>Trying to clean up a mess created by mixing positional and named parameters. Unfortunately I did not give it enough thought at the time and copied parameters handling behaviour from Python. Now <a href="https://ngs-lang.org/">NGS</a> also has the same problem as Python had before 3.8. Hopefully, I will be able to fix it in some more elegant way than Python did.</p>



<h2>LRU cache</h2>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache"><code>functools.lru_cache()</code></a> can now be used as a straight decorator rather than as a function returning a decorator. So both of these are now supported</p></blockquote>



<p>OK. Bug fix. But … (functools.py)</p>



<pre><code>    if isinstance(maxsize, int):
        # Negative maxsize is treated as 0
        if maxsize &lt; 0:
            maxsize = 0</code></pre>



<p>If you are setting LRU cache size to a negative number, it’s 99% by mistake. In NGS that would be an exception. That’s the approach that causes <code>rm -rf $myfolder/</code> to remove <code>/</code> when <code>myfolder</code> is unset. Note that the <code>maxsize</code> code is not new but it’s still there in Python 3.8. I guess that is another mistake which can not be easily fixed now because that would break “working” code.</p>



<h2>Collections</h2>



<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.somenamedtuple._asdict"><code>_asdict()</code></a> method for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple"><code>collections.namedtuple()</code></a> now returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#dict"><code>dict</code></a> instead of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict"><code>collections.OrderedDict</code></a>. This works because regular dicts have guaranteed ordering since Python 3.7</p></blockquote>



<p>OK. Everybody had the mistake of making maps unordered: Perl, Ruby, Python.</p>



<ol><li>Ruby <a href="https://www.igvita.com/2009/02/04/ruby-19-internals-ordered-hash/">fixed that with the release of version 1.9</a> in 2008 (according to the post).</li><li>Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/">fixed that with the release of version 3.7</a> in 2018 (which I take as 10 years of “f*ck you, the developer”).</li><li>Perl <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/keys.html">keeps using unordered maps according to documentation</a>.</li><li>Same for Raku, again according to <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/hashmap">the documentation</a>.</li></ol>



<p>NGS had ordered maps from the start but that’s not a fair comparison because NGS project started in 2013, when the mistake was already understood.</p>



<hr>



<p>How all that helps you, the reader? I encourage deeper thinking about the choice of programming languages that you use. From my perspective, all languages suck, while NGS aims to suck less than the rest for the intended <a href="https://github.com/ngs-lang/ngs/wiki/Use-Cases">use cases</a> (tl;dr – for DevOps scripting).</p>



<hr>



<h2>Update 2020-08-16</h2>



<p>Discussions:</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24176823">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24176823</a></li><li><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/rgcgjz/python_3_8_makes_me_sad_again">https://lobste.rs/s/rgcgjz/python_3_8_makes_me_sad_again</a></li></ol>



<h2>Update 2020-08-17</h2>



<p>It looks like the article above needs some clarification about my perspective: background, what I am doing and why.</p>



<h3>TL;DR</h3>



<p>The main points of the article are:</p>



<ol><li>Everything still sucks, including Python. By sucks I mean does not fit well with the tasks I need to do neither aligned with how I think about these tasks.</li><li>I am trying to help the situation and the industry by developing my own programming language</li></ol>



<h3>Background about my Thinking</h3>



<p>In general, I’m amazed with how bad the overall state of programming is. That includes:</p>



<ol><li>All programming languages that I know including my own NGS. This is aggravated by inability to fix anything properly for any language with substantial amount of code written in it because you will be breaking existing code. And if you do break, you get the shitstorm like with Python 3 or Perl 6 (Raku).</li><li><a href="https://github.com/MohGovIL/hamagen-react-native/issues/115">Code quality</a> of the programs written in all languages. Most of the code that I have seen is bad. Sometimes even in <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cpp-docs/issues/1929">official examples</a>.</li><li>Quality of available materials, which are sometimes <a href="https://dev.to/ilya_sher_prog/comment/m9oe">plainly wrong</a>.</li><li>Many of existing “Infrastructure as code” solutions, which in most cases follow the same path:<ol><li>Invent  a DSL or use YAML.</li><li>“figure out” later that it’s not powerful enough (by the way there is an elegant solution – a programming language, forgot the name)</li><li>Create pretty ugly programming language on top of a DSL that was intended for data.</li></ol></li></ol>



<p>I am creating new programming language and a shell out of <strong>frustration with current situation, especially with bash and Python</strong>. Why these two? Because that’s what I was and still using to get my tasks done.</p>



<p>Are these languages bad? I don’t think it’s a question with any good answers. <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2017/10/10/why-i-have-no-favorite-programming-language/">These languages don’t fit the tasks that I’m trying to do</a> nor are aligned with how I think while being apparently one of the best choices available.</p>



<h3>This Article Background</h3>



<ol><li>Seen some post on RSS about new features in Python 3.8.</li><li>Took a look.</li><li>Yep, everything is still f*cked up.</li><li>Wrote a post about it which was not meant to be “deep discussion about Python flaws”.</li></ol>



<p>I was not planning to invest more time in this but here I am trying to clarify.</p>



<h3>And your Language is Better? Really?</h3>



<p>Let’s clarify “better”.  For me, it’s to suck less than the rest for the intended use cases.</p>



<blockquote><p>author really does consider himself a superior language designer than the Python core-dev team</p></blockquote>



<p>( From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iartgp/python_38_makes_me_sad_again/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iartgp/python_38_makes_me_sad_again/</a> )</p>



<p>I consider myself in much easier circumstances:</p>



<ol><li>No substantial amount of code is written in NGS yet.</li><li>I’m starting later and therefore have the advantage of looking at more languages, avoiding bad parts, copying (with adaptation) the good parts.</li><li>NGS targets a niche, it’s not intended to be general purpose language. Choices are clearer and easier when you target a niche.</li><li>The language that I’m creating is almost by definition is more aligned with how I think. Hoping that people out there will benefit from using NGS if it is more aligned with how they think too.</li><li>See also my <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2016/10/28/creating-a-language-is-easier-now/">Creating a language is easier&nbsp;now</a> (2016) post.</li></ol>



<p>Will I be able to make a “better” language?</p>



<p><strong>From technical perspective</strong>, that’s probable: I am a skilled programmer in several languages and I have languages to look at more than everybody else had before. My disadvantage is not much experience in language design. I’m trying to offset that with thinking hard (<a href="https://github.com/ngs-lang/ngs/wiki#design-documents">about the language</a>, the essence of <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2019/05/18/on-information-loss-in-software/">what is being expressed</a>, common patterns, etc), looking at other languages and experimenting.</p>



<p><strong>From marketing perspective</strong>, I need to learn a lot. I am aware that “technically better” doesn’t matter as much as I would like to. Without community and users that would be a failed project.</p>



<p>Also don’t forget luck which I might or might not have.</p>



<h3>What if NGS fails?</h3>



<p>I think that the situation today is unbearable. I’m trying to fix it. I feel like I have to, despite the odds. I hope that even if NGS fails to move the industry forward it would be useful to somebody who will attempt that later.</p>

<p><strong>Simple Android* MVI architecture using kotlin flows</strong></p>
<p><em>* The library is platform-neutral but was designed with Android in mind</em></p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>We set off with the objective of creating a minimalistic library, simple yet with all the
capabilities you need.</p>
<h3 id="minimalistic-yet-complete-">Minimalistic yet complete</h3>
<p>MVFlow has a very small API surface. It strives to be the smallest conceivable MVI library that could exist.
In just a few minutes you will know everything there is to know about the API!</p>
<h3 id="simple-">Simple</h3>
<p>The library introduces few - if any - new concepts outside MVI,
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/basics.html">Kotlin coroutines</a>, and
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html">Kotlin flows</a>.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with those concepts, you can start using the library without a problem; if you are new to some of these
concepts, you will be able to apply those concepts outside this library too.</p>
<h3 id="coroutines-and-flows-as-powerful-abstractions-">Coroutines and flows as powerful abstractions</h3>
<p>Any MVI library needs to accomplish the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manage the current state (Model in MVI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call a render function when the state changes (View in MVI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detect user interactions (Intent in MVI)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process user intents, potentially mutating the current state</p>
</li>
</ul>


<p>We believe that coroutines and flows are extremely powerful concepts that can be applied to this architecture.
They enable us to build a very powerful API with a small and simple surface.</p>
<p>Here are some advantages that they bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coroutines make asynchronous calls very simple to write and easy to reason about;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flows are a great abstraction to represent user events (clicks) and updates from background work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coroutine scopes make handling the lifecycle of requests very simple</p>
<ul>
<li>For example: if you have pending work for a particular screen, and the user presses back, by
cancelling that screen’s coroutine, all related jobs and listeners are cancelled too.

<h3 id="with-mvflow-you-are-in-control--">With MVFlow you are in control </h3>
<p>The library only gives you an implementation of MVI, but doesn’t force you into specific patterns other than using MVI
and coroutines.</p>
<p>You are free to use dependency injection your way; you are free to do navigation your way; plug your
logging framework (or not). You can use data stores, use cases, interactors, or any other abstraction to get and
manipulate your data.</p>
<p>MVFlow plays well with Android’s ViewModel, but you don’t have to use it.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-am-new-to-mvi-coroutines-or-flows">What if I am new to MVI, coroutines, or flows?</h2>
<p>There are plenty of guides introducing these concepts. We are still working on a brief introduction to MVI,
meanwhile we suggest you read the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/model-view-intent">Model-view-intent on Android</a> by Hannes Dorfmann - one of the
first posts (if not the first) about MVI</p>

</ul>

<p>For learning about coroutines and flows, the official guides are a good source of information:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<h3 id="view">View</h3>
<p>The library has two main interfaces: <code>MVFlow</code> and <code>MVFlow.View</code>. Let’s take a look at the view first:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>interface</span> <span>View</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>fun</span> <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>)</span>

    <span>fun</span> <span>actions</span><span>():</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Action</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this is a very simple interface: any view needs to know how to render a given state (which is a generic
class defined by you) and creates a flow of actions which
report the user interactions with the UI.</p>
<p>Read the article <a href="https://pedroql.github.io/mvflow/implementing-your-view-actions-flow/">implementing your view actions flow</a> to see how you
can implement the actions method.</p>
<p>Let’s implement a simple screen with a list of users. The current state indicates whether it is loading information, the
users that were loaded (if any) and a error message (if any):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span> 
     <span>// ... 
</span><span></span><span>)</span>

<span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>State</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>users</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;?,</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>isLoading</span><span>:</span> <span>Boolean</span><span>,</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>errorMessage</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>?</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The possible actions are loading users (say, by pressing a button or doing a pull-to-refresh gesture) and selecting a
user by tapping on its row:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>sealed</span> <span>class</span> <span>Action</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>object</span> <span>LoadUsers</span> <span>:</span> <span>Action</span><span>()</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>UserSelection</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>User</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Action</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="handler">Handler</h3>
<p>So now that we have a view, we can render the UI and send actions into a flow when the user interacts with the app.</p>
<p>The next step is doing something with those actions. Typically, this involves doing some operation like a network or
database call, and we might want to change the current state from said jobs.</p>
<p>This is where <code>Handler</code> comes in. To keep things simple, this is just a lambda but it is type-aliased for more
meaningful parameter names:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>typealias</span> <span>Handler</span><span>&lt;</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>,</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>State</span><span>,</span> <span>Action</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Mutation</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Reading that aloud, we see that a handler is a function that receives the current state and an action the user just
performed. The handler performs what this action requires (e.g. making a network call) and returns a flow of mutations.
A mutation is the information of what needs to change in the current state.
When the handler completes the network request, it can emit a value into the mutation flow to update the state.</p>
<p>Continuing our example, there are three reasons to change the state: we started loading data, we received an error from
the request or we received data (new users) from the request:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>sealed</span> <span>class</span> <span>Mutation</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>object</span> <span>StartedLoading</span> <span>:</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>()</span>
   <span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>ErrorLoading</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>()</span>
   <span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>UsersReceived</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> <span>users</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Mutation</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="reducer">Reducer</h3>
<p>Right now we have a view rendering the state and telling us of actions performed by the user. We also have a handler
that is receiving those actions and acting on them. The handler emits mutations that we already know will be used to
update the current state.</p>
<p>Now the reducer enters the stage:</p>
<p>A reducer is just another function that receives the current state and a mutation. It will combine both, producing
the a new state the succeeds the current one.</p>
<p><em>Note: although the handler receives the current state when an action is performed, if the handler performs a slow
operation, the handler will no longer know the most recent state. This is why the handler can’t mutate the state
directly.</em></p>

<p>At this point we have explained the main MVI components. The final step is assembling them together so that actions are
sent to the handler, mutations are sent to the reducer, and new states are sent to the view.</p>

with logging information and you can decide to print this to the logs or not.</p>
<h3 id="special-effects">Special effects</h3>
<p>Effects are an optional feature that can be very useful for UI-related operations like showing
Toasts and navigating to new screens.</p>
<p>Because the handler may have a different lifecycle from the view, it should not perform these operations directly (it
would also break the single responsibility principle).</p>
<p>To make this common scenario easier to address, there is a new set of interfaces that extend the interfaces we have seen
until here. These interfaces have the suffix <code>WithEffects</code> and bring additional functionality to make external effects
possible.</p>
<p>The changes are very simple:</p>
<p>The <code>Handler</code> instead of just receiving the current state and one action, receives one effect sender that can be used to
send effects to be handled externally. <code>Effect…</code></p></article></div></div></div></div>

      <p><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are often praised as the "holy grail" for building collaborative applications because they don't require a central authority to resolve sync conflicts. They open up new possibilities to scale the backend infrastructure and are also well-suited as a data-model for distributed apps that don't require a server at all.</p><p>However, several text editor developers report not to use them because they impose a too significant overhead.</p><p>Just recently, Marijn Haverbeke wrote about his considerations against using CRDTs as a data model for <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a>:</p><blockquote>[..] the cost of such a representation is significant, and in the end, I judged the requirement for converging positions to be too obscure to justify that level of extra complexity and memory use. <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">(source)</a></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi Editor</a> used a CRDT as its data model to allow different processes (syntax highlighter, type checker, ..) to concurrently access the editor state without blocking the process. They reverted to a synchronous model because ..</p><blockquote>[..] CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">(source)</a></blockquote><p>Apparently, everyone recognizes that CRDTs have a lot of potential, but concluded that the memory overhead of using them must be too expensive for real-world applications.</p><p>They bring up a fair point. Most CRDTs assign a unique ID to <em>every character</em> that was ever created in the document. In order to ensure that documents can always converge, the CRDT model preserves this metadata even when characters are deleted.</p><p>This seems to be particularly expensive in dynamic languages like JavaScript. Other languages allow you to efficiently represent all those characters and IDs in-memory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a> (e.g. C or Rust). In JavaScript, everything is represented as an <code>Object</code> - basically a key-value map that needs to keep track of all its keys and values. CRDTs assign multiple properties to every single character in the document to ensure conflict resolution. The memory overhead of merely representing a document as a CRDT could be immense.</p><p>Every user-interaction creates more metadata that the CRDT needs to retain in order to ensure conflict resolution. It is not uncommon that CRDTs create millions of objects to store all this metadata. The JavaScript engine manages these objects on the heap, checks if they are referenced, and, if possible, garbage collects them. Another major problem is that with an increasing number of object creations, the cost of creating additional objects increases exponentially.

I hope to convince you that the overhead is actually very small even for large documents with long edit histories.</p><h2 id="yjs">Yjs</h2><p>Yjs is a framework for building collaborative applications using CRDTs as the data model. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions that enable shared editing using different editors (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-prosemirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/prosemirror">ProseMirror</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remirror/extension-yjs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror">Remirror</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-quilljs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/quill">Quill</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/codemirror">CodeMirror</a>, ..), different networking technologies (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket">WebSocket</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-webrtc">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-hyper">Hyper</a>, ..), and different persistence layers (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-indexeddb">IndexedDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-leveldb">LevelDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-redis">Redis</a>, ..). Most shared editing solutions are tied to a specific editor and to a specific backend. With Yjs, you can make any of the supported editors collaborative and exchange document updates through your custom communication channel, over a peer-to-peer WebRTC network, or over a scalable server infrastructure. My vision for this project is that you can simply compose your collaborative application using the technologies that make sense for your project. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs"><div><p>yjs/yjs</p><p>Peer-to-peer shared types.

If not, and you want to dive into this rabbit hole, I recommend this fun interactive series:</p><figure><a href="https://lars.hupel.info/topics/crdt/01-intro/"><div><p>CRDTs: Part 1</p><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/profile.jpg"><span>Lars Hupel</span><span>Lars Hupel</span></p></div><p><img src="https://lars.hupel.info/img/topics/crdt/world.jpg"></p></a><figcaption>A fun interactive series about CRDTs</figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://crdt.tech/resources"><div><p>CRDT Resources • Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</p><p>Resources and community around CRDT technology — papers, blog posts, code and more.</p><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/favicons/favicon-192x192.png"><span>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</span></p></div><p><img src="https://crdt.tech/assets/img/crdt-favicon.png"></p></a><figcaption>Good entry point to find more CRDT related resources</figcaption></figure><p>The concept paper that describes Yjs' conflict resolution algorithm YATA is available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types">Researchgate</a>. The concepts discussed here are pretty generic and could be extended to almost any CRDT.</p><p>In order to determine the performance cost, we are are going to examine how Yjs maintains data. Please bear with me while I describe how the CRDT model is represented using JavaScript objects. This will be relevant later.</p><p>Similarly to other CRDTs, the YATA CRDT assigns a unique ID to every character. These characters are then maintained in a doubly linked list.</p><p>The unique IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp"> Lamport Timestamps</a>. They consist of a unique user identifier and a logical clock that increases with each character insertion.</p><p>When a user types the content "ABC" from left to right, it will perform the following operations: <code>insert(0, "A") • insert(1, "B") • insert(2, "C")</code>. The linked list of the YATA CRDT, which models the textual content, will look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/crdt-datamodel.svg" alt=""><figcaption>CRDT model of inserting content "ABC" (assuming the user has the unique client identifier "1")</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how every character can be uniquely identified by the combination of the unique client-id and an ever-increasing <code>clock</code> counter.</p><p>Yjs represents the items of the linked list as <code>Item</code> objects that contain some content (in this case a String), a unique ID, the links to the adjacent <code>Item</code> objects, and additional metadata that is relevant for the CRDT algorithm.</p><p>All CRDTs assign some kind of unique ID and additional metadata to every character, which is very memory-consuming for large documents. We can't get rid of metadata as it is necessary for conflict resolution. Yjs also uniquely identifies each character and assigns metadata, but represents this information efficiently. Larger document insertions are represented as a single <code>Item</code> object using the character-offset to uniquely identify each character individually. The below <code>Item</code> uniquely identifies character <code>"A"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 0 }</code>, character <code>"B"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 1 }</code>, and so on..</p><figure><pre><code>Item {
    id: { client: 1, clock: 0 },
    content: 'ABC',
    ...
}</code></pre><figcaption>Yjs's internal representation of items in the linked list</figcaption></figure><p>If a user copy/pastes a lot of content into the document, the inserted content is represented by a single <code>Item</code>. Furthermore, single-character insertions that are written from left to right can be merged into a single <code>Item</code>. It is just important that we are able to split and merge items without losing any metadata.</p><p>This type of compound representation of the CRDT model and its split-functionality have first been described in <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-a-string-wise-crdt-algorithm-for-smart-and-large-scale-collaborative-editing-sys.html">"A string-wise CRDT algorithm for smart and large-scale collaborative systems"</a>. Yjs adapts this approach for YATA and also includes functionality to merge <code>Item</code> objects.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-operations">The Cost of Operations</h2><p>With this simple optimization in mind, let's have a look at how the number of modifications on a document relates to the amount of metadata that needs to be retained. We will measure metadata by the amount of <code>Item</code> objects created and later examine what the cost of a single <code>Item</code> is.</p><p>Every user interaction with a text editor can be expressed as either an <strong>insert</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong> operation.</p><ul><li><code>insert(index: number, content: string)</code><strong> </strong>Insertions of any size create a single <code>Item</code> that is integrated into the document. In some cases the integration requires to split an existing <code>Item</code>. So we have a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations per insertion.</li><li><code>delete(index: number, length: number)</code> Deleting an <code>Item</code> only marks it as deleted. I.e <code>item.deleted = true</code>. Therefore, <code>Item</code> deletions are free and will reduce the amount of memory used because the <code>Item.content</code> can be removed. The <code>Item</code> doesn't need to retain the content for doing conflict resolution. But deleting a range of content might require to split two existing items. Therefore, the cost of deletions is a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations also.</li></ul><p>By using the compound representation of CRDTs, the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations produced by a user. Not to the amount of characters inserted. This makes a huge difference in practice. Most larger documents are created by copy-pasting existing content or by moving paragraphs to other positions. Any kind of operation, even copy-paste and undo/redo, only create at most two <code>Item</code> objects.</p><p>Yjs also supports rich-text and structured documents. The above statement, that the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations, still holds true for these kinds of documents. But measuring operation-cost for more complex operations is out of scope of this article. An interesting observation in practice is that the document size of long-running …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>The Indonesia National AI Strategy, now known as <span><a href="https://ai-innovation.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranas KA</a></span> (<em>Strategi Nasional Kecerdasan Artifisial)</em>, has been published. The new strategy was announced by the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Research_and_Technology/National_Research_and_Innovation_Agency_(Indonesia)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minister of Research and Technology</a></span> and head of the <a href="https://www.ristekbrin.go.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>BRIN</span></a> (the National Research and Innovation Agency) <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambang_Brodjonegoro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bambang PS Brodjonegoro </a></span>in an television address made last Monday to mark the country’s 25th National Technology Awakening Day. The minister also launched an electronic innovation catalogue, helping Indonesian technology developers to market their offerings and sell to government procurement offices.</p>
<p>Transforming Indonesia into a Fourth Industrial Revolution economy has become focus for the government over the past few years and the necessity of creating a digital-savvy workforce has become a top priority. Stranas KA aims to tie together many of the country’s digital initiatives and maps closely to <em><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_of_Indonesia_2045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visi Indonesia 2045</a></span></em>, the country’s broad economic, social, governance and technology development strategy. The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy Framework provides an at-a-glance view of how these different goals are held in context.</p>
<p>Stranas KA aims to support five national priorities, where the government believes that artificial intelligence could have the biggest impact on national progress and outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Health services</strong> – With 268 million people living across 6,000 of Indonesia’s total 17,504 islands, delivering a consistent standard of healthcare is a national challenge. The archipelago also faces increased risks from global disease outbreaks such as SARS and, recently, Covid-19. The country’s response to the pandemic has already somewhat accelerated plans for smart hospitals and health security infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Bureaucractic reform</strong> – With a civilian civil service of about 4 million, reforming the government’s highly centralised administration remains a significant challenge. Indonesia is lagged in implementation of digital services, according to the United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/publication/2020-united-nations-e-government-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>E-Government Development Index (EGDI)</span></a>, ranking below Borneo, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. President <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joko_Widodo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joko Widodo</a></span> has promised to create a citizen-centric digitised service government <em>(Pemerintahan Digital Melayani)</em> in the next five years.</p>
<p><strong>Education and research</strong> – Education is integral to Visi Indonesia 2045 and the move towards online schooling during the Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare the country’s digital divide. The pressures of the digital economy are also recognised by development plans. According to the government, Indonesia needs a digital workforce of 113 million by 2030-2035.</p>
<p><strong>Food security</strong> – According to President Widodo, food security remains Indonesia’s top priority and the Food Security Agency focuses on three main areas: food availability, food accessibility and food utilisation. Food, agriculture and fisheries government departments and agencies have already begun using satellite technology, machine learning and smart farming to better plan, forecast and manage agricultural production and natural resources.</p>
<p><strong>Mobility and smart cities</strong> – The number of people living in Indonesia’s urban areas is now close to 60 percent and is expected to rise to 70 percent of the total population by the year 2050. The government currently plans to develop 98 smart cities and 416 smart districts, under Indonesia’s 100 Smart Cities Plan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Indonesia national AI strategy identifies four key focus areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Ethics and Policy</li>
<li>Talent Development</li>
<li>Infrastructure and Data</li>
<li>Industrial Research and Innovation</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Indonesia is already one of South East Asia’s biggest investors in artificial intelligence, with IDC’s 2018 <span><a href="https://www.idc.com/ap/pulse/2018-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asia-Pacific Enterprise Cognitive/AI survey</a></span> finding that 25 percent of large organisations in the country have adopted AI systems (compared with 17% in Thailand, 10% in Singapore and 8% in Malaysia).</p>
<p>Smart cities, one of Stranas KA’s five top priority areas, have been identified as a fundamental building block for Indonesia’s Industry 4.0 future. Last year President Widodo announced plans to create a new futuristic smart city capital on the island of Borneo, to replace Jakarta. The <span><a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/12/23/nagara-rimba-nusa-announced-as-winner-of-new-capital-city-design-contest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new capital</a></span> will rely heavily on sustainable smart city systems, cleantech and infrastructure run by emerging technologies such as 5G, AI and IoT (Internet of Things). Originally slated for completion by 2024 (pre-pandemic) and estimated to cost $33 billion, the project reportedly received an offer by Japanese multinational investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoftBank Group</a> to invest up to $40 billion.</p>
<p>The Indonesia National AI Strategy details a programme roadmap for both its four key focus areas and the five national priorities, for which it considers plans as short-term (2020-2024) and longer-term (2025-2045). All in all, the strategy document identifies 186 programmes, including many that aim to develop the plans, pilot schemes, policies and regulations, plus checks and balances, necessary to drive the overall strategy.</p>
<p>Underpinning the acceleration of Indonesia’s artificial intelligence journey, Stranas KA includes plans for national standards, regulations and an ethics board to ensure that usage of AI is in accordance with the country’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancasila_(politics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pancasila</a> </em>values system.</p>
<p>The development of the 194-page National Artificial Intelligence Strategy was coordinated by the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology or <span><a href="https://www.bppt.go.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BPPT</a></span>, a non-ministerial government agency under the coordination of the Ministry for Research and Technology, and was widely anticipated to be announced in July or August. A wide variety of public and private sector organisations contributed to the plan including government ministries, universities, industry associations and national telecom providers.</p>
<p>Although many of the programmes and initiatives detailed in the Indonesia National AI Strategy can be found in existing government strategies, plans and policy, Stranas KA is nevertheless highly ambitious. The success of the overall plan will likely rest heavily on how many of the foundation programmes it is able to get off the ground during the next 4-5 years.</p>

<p>I always had troubles managing errors in Clojure until I discovered <a href="https://github.com/exoscale/ex">ex</a> (written by a coworker, thanks to him :p). This library was a game changer for me.</p>
<p><code>ex</code> allows you to define exception types in the ex data by setting the <code>:exoscale.ex/type</code> key. You can then use the <code>try+</code> macro to catch Exceptions with a given type, like in this example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">(ex/try+

  (throw (ex-info "Argh" {:type ::bar :foo "a foo"}))

  (catch ::foo data
    (prn :got-ex-data data))

  (catch ::bar {:as data :keys [foo]}
    ;; in that case it would hit this one
    (prn :got-ex-data-again foo))

  (catch ExceptionInfo e
   ;; this would match an ex-info that didn't get a hit with catch-ex-info)

  (catch Exception e (prn :boring))

  (finally (prn :boring-too))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><code>ex</code> also provides default types like <code>:exoscale.ex/not-found</code>, <code>:exoscale.ex/forbidden</code> and helper functions to create exceptions (like <code>(exoscale.ex/ex-not-found "not found !" {:foo "bar"})</code> to create an exception of type <code>:exoscale.ex/not-found</code>, or <code>exoscale.ex/ex-not-found!</code> to create and throw it).</p>
<p><code>ex</code> also allows you to derive exceptions types from other types.<br>
Let’s take an example. You might want have multiple types for authentication errors, like <code>::invalid-api-key</code> or <code>::invalid-token</code>, but make them all derive from <code>::ex/forbidden</code> to be able to convert them easily to an HTTP response:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">(ex/derive ::invalid-api-key ::ex/forbidden)
(ex/derive ::invalid-token ::ex/forbidden)

(defmulti ex-&gt;response
  (fn [e]
    (some-&gt; e ex-data :type))
  :hierarchy exoscale.ex/hierarchy)

(defmethod ex-&gt;response ::ex/forbidden [e]
  {:body (ex-message e)
   :status 403})

(defmethod ex-&gt;response ::ex/not-found [e]
  {:body (ex-message e)
   :status 404})

(defmethod ex-&gt;response :default [_]
  {:body "default error message"
   :status 500})</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s generate some errors:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>(ex-&gt;response (ex/ex-not-found "thing not found"))
{:body "thing not found", :status 404}

(ex-&gt;response (ex-info "invalid token" {:type ::invalid-token}))
{:body "invalid token", :status 403}

(ex-&gt;response (ex-info "invalid api key" {:type ::invalid-api-key}))
{:body "invalid api key", :status 403}

(ex-&gt;response (ex-info "error !" {}))
{:body "default error message", :status 500}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can do tons of things with this library !</p>
</div></div>]]>

<h2>Or, Why is Mediterranean Maritime Sovereignty So Complicated?</h2>



<p>The Mediterranean Sea could almost be considered an inland body of water, except for a small connection to the Atlantic Ocean (only 16 km or 10 miles) between the coasts of Spain and Morocco at the Strait of Gibraltar. The waters of the Mediterranean can be further divided into the Alboran, Libyan, Levantine, Aegean, Ionian, Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, and Balearic Seas. Twenty-three separate States lay claim to the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, and many of these are overlapping or disputed leading to an incredibly complex picture of maritime sovereignty.</p>



<h2>The Established Boundaries</h2>



<p>There are, however, twenty-two established maritime boundaries between the various Mediterranean States. The oldest is between Cyprus and the UK on behalf of its Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) of Akrotiri and Dhekelia located in the south of the island. Both the land and maritime boundaries between the SBAs and Cyprus were established by the same agreement from which Cyprus gained its independence from the UK on 16 August 1960. The <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-united-kingdom-maritime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maritime boundary</a> extends in four separate parts from the various land boundary termini on the coast and delimits the UK’s claimed three nautical mile territorial sea and Cyprus’s 12. The UK ceded all exclusive economic zone (EEZ) claims to Cyprus.</p>

<p>The most recent (as of late July 2020) Mediterranean maritime boundary is between Greece and Italy, signed on 9 June 2020. This new agreement updates a 24 May 1977 Treaty, transforming the already-established 16 point maritime boundary into WGS-84 and confirming its application for the EEZ, in addition to the continental shelf (CS). The 2020 update left the tripoints, with Albania in the north and Libya in the south, undefined. The Italy–Greece boundary is arguably less interesting than the second most recent Mediterranean maritime boundary between Turkey and Libya (signed 27 November 2019). That will be covered in greater depth below.</p>

<p>Surprise! Greece and Egypt signed a new EEZ boundary Agreement on Thursday, August 6. The details have not yet been released to the public, but both Turkey and Libya have already protested the new boundary.</p>



<p>The shortest established Mediterranean maritime boundary is between <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/italy-slovenia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy and Slovenia</a> at 15 M and the longest is between <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/italy-tunisia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy and Tunisia</a>, which runs for 528 M.</p>



<p>That leaves about 30 maritime boundaries to be established, some of which are currently being negotiated (Greece and Albania) and some of which have 300 plus years of dispute that will need to be resolved before maritime boundary delimitation can begin (Spain and the UK on behalf of Gibraltar).</p>



<h2>Disputed Maritime Space</h2>



<p>When looking at disputed maritime areas in the Mediterranean, Turkey is the shadow over all of the eastern Sea. Its role in the Cyprus–Northern Cyprus conflict as well as the full extent of maritime disputes with Greece will be discussed in greater detail below. This section is to delve into Turkey’s full set of unilateral maritime claims which were updated in 2019.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1024x576.png" alt="Map showing Turkey's unilateral maritime claim, overlaid with established maritime boundaries and provisional equidistance lines from Sovereign Limits." srcset="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-300x169.png 300w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-60x34.png 60w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-768x432.png 768w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1536x865.png 1536w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-2048x1153.png 2048w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>This map depicting extensions of Turkey’s EEZ claims was released by a Turkish diplomat in December 2019 (the map source and more information is from this <a href="https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/map-delineates-turkeys-maritime-frontiers-in-med-sea-149379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>). To capture the complicated nature of all of the other claims and established maritime boundaries, we’ve overlaid Sovereign Limits maritime data over top.</em> Between points A and B is the established maritime boundary with Northern Cyprus and between points E and F the new line with Libya.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Additionally, on 27 November 2019, Turkey and the UN-backed government of Libya (Libya is in the midst of a civil war, so yes, there are two entirely separate governments) signed a short, two-point maritime boundary agreement that dangles in the middle of Greek-claimed sea. This new boundary enraged neighboring Greece and Egypt as well as the entire EU. Its location deviates from the equidistance default stipulated by UNCLOS. Turkey and Libya note that the bilaterally negotiated boundary has nothing to do with third states, but as Greece claims the waters surrounding this new delimitation, it has caused quite a stir. The new August 2020 Egypt–Greece maritime boundary likely overlaps with the Libya–Turkey boundary in some capacity.</p>



<p>The conflict between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus would not have reached its modern outcome without Turkish involvement. Disagreements between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots on the island of Cyprus have been ongoing since even before Ottoman control of the island, and the modern conflict began shortly after independence from the United Kingdom. Turkey moved to occupy northern Cyprus in 1974 and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared independence in 1983. Today, Turkey is the only country who recognizes Northern Cyprus’s statehood.</p>



<p>The island of Cyprus is now divided by a UN mandated and monitored buffer zone that snakes its way through hilly territory and divides the capital city (for both Cypruses) of Nicosia. The southern Greek Republic of Cyprus is an EU member and is recognized by the UN as the sole sovereign power of the island.</p>



<p>Related to the Cyprus dispute, the maritime picture off the coast of the island is quite complicated. The Republic of Cyprus has established maritime boundaries with <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-egypt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-israel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel</a>, and <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lebanon</a>, in addition to the short UK boundaries already mentioned. Northern Cyprus agreed to a maritime boundary with Turkey, that the southern Republic of Cyprus disputes. Due to the nature of the dispute, the maritime boundaries between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus are also unresolved (and unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future).</p>



<p>Turning to the maritime disputes between Turkey and neighboring Greece offers an even more complicated picture (at least delimitation wise) due to the multitude of Greek Islands that lay just off the Turkish coast. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been historically complicated and often quite problematic, negativity driven by both the conflict in Cyprus and unresolved maritime issues in the Aegean Sea. Oil was discovered in the continental shelf in 1973, adding [literal] fuel to the fire.</p>

Turkey’s proposed maritime boundary lies to the west of equidistance.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Greece and Turkey have two extremely different perspectives on the possible delimitations of the maritime boundary through the Aegean Sea. Turkey is not a signatory of UNCLOS and claims that Greece’s Aegean Islands are not entitled to full continental shelf claims and would seek to have a mainland coast equidistance boundary through the middle of the Aegean Sea, while enclaving the Greek islands on the Turkish side of the maritime boundary line. Greece, a signatory of UNCLOS, meanwhile proposes a strict equidistance-based maritime boundary utilizing all of its islands, pushing the maritime boundary far to the east, just off the Turkish coast. Turkey’s position on the Greek claim is that this would create a “Greek Lake” of the Aegean Sea and severely limit Turkey’s freedom of navigation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.</p>



<p>There is also at least one officially disputed island between Turkey and Greece known as Imia by the Greeks and Kardak by the Turks. Turkish claims to additional islands have been made and redacted over the years.</p>



<p>Conflict over Greek and Turkish maritime claims is common. During the summer of 2020, Turkey has been conducting seismic surveys in Greek-claimed waters. And Greece is working on increasing its military power in response to Turkish aggression. Meanwhile, diplomats from the two states also sat down for a round of negotiations. In August, Greece called for talks to continue or a referral of the dispute to the ICJ.

<p>Looking beyond Turkey-centered disputes, there is a handful of interesting and impossible to resolve conflicts that speckle the entire Mediterranean Sea and neighboring bodies of water. Israel and Lebanon seem to be constantly in conflict over both their unresolved <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/israel-lebanon-land" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">land boundary</a> and maritime frontier. Natural gas reserves have been discovered in maritime space that both states claim, and in 2018 Lebanon auctioned off several disputed oil blocks. Israel is currently working on its own oil exploration in the disputed area.</p>



<p>The Palestinian territory of Gaza set forth maritime claims in 2015 and 2019 in which they proposed lateral boundaries with Egypt and Israel, creating a corridor of Palestinian maritime space before reaching the boundary with Cyprus. Both Israel and Egypt have submitted protests to the UN over Palestine’s unilateral maritime claims.</p>

<p>The former Yugoslav States of Croatia and Slovenia also have disputed maritime space in the northern Adriatic Sea despite a <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/croatia-slovenia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 Permanent Court of Arbitration Award</a> delimiting the boundary (Croatia had unilaterally withdrawn from the case in 2015 following a scandal). Slovenia accepts the Tribunal’s delimitation, but Croatia does not.</p>



<p>Some similarities can be drawn to the maritime boundary between Greece and Albania in the southern reaches of the Adriatic Sea. The two States signed a maritime boundary agreement in 2009, but this document was annulled shortly thereafter by Albania. Negotiations over the maritime boundary began again in 2018 and are ongoing. And with Greece’s current dedication to maritime boundary delimitation with its neighbors it is plausible that a new Greece–Albania maritime boundary Agreement …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Read about how we were able to use publicly available data to create large amounts of content and take our marketing to the next level.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-read-this">Why Should You Read This?</h2>
<p>Are you in the process of starting a SaaS, e-commerce store or a local business? Then I think this story can help you develop a strategy to get your first hundred dollars MRR without spending tons of money on marketing. Lets begin.</p>
<h3 id="we-had-a-product-without-traffic-what-to-do">We Had a Product Without Traffic, What to Do?</h3>
<p>One of the first products we developed was an online preparation course for the Swedish SAT test. We created thousands of practice questions, hired math experts to write tutorials and spent a lot of time creating optimized landing pages. However, the traffic never came. This was our start.</p>
<p><img src="https://mocki.io/hpskolan.png" alt="Swedish SAT" title="Swedish SAT"></p>
<p>At the stage we were at, I think a lot of developers creating their own products give up. Developers can spend an insane amount of time creating a product <strong>THEY</strong> like. But unfortunately we are not good at selling our products or showing them to users in a way that make them interested.</p>
<p>We started thinking what people actually search for in regards to the Swedish SAT and college education. After doing some analysis we noticed that a lot of people used search queries like:</p>
<ol>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into Law at Stockholm university?</li>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into any Law school in Sweden?</li>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into Computer Science at Linköping university?</li>
<li>Which education in Sweden was the hardest to get into?</li>
<li>Which education had the most applications 2015?</li>
</ol>
<p>You see these are all related to education. And we figured out that a lot of people searching for these things are interested in improving their SAT test score. So how did we use this? We could have started writing articles like crazy about each education programme, but that would be really time consuming. Instead we approached the problem like developres and started to look at how we could actually generate one page with this kind of data for each education in Sweden.</p>
<h3 id="open-data-apis--the-golden-egg-">Open Data APIs - the Golden Egg 🥚</h3>
<p>This is where things start to become interesting. Open data APIs! At Mocki we are very supportive of governments and organizations opening up their data publicly. It's an amazing way to let normal companies or people develop applications that never would have been developed otherwise. Our interest in open data started that day when we got our hands on application data for every education in Sweden.</p>
<p>For a specific education programme we were able to see</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of applicants.</li>
<li>The number of accepted people.</li>
<li>The required SAT score to get accepted.</li>
<li>The percentage of women/men</li>
<li>The percentage of Swedish/Non-Swedish people.</li>
<li>And a lot more…</li>
</ol>
<p>Suddenly we were able to answer all the questions mentioned earler. We also realised that we could create a website out of this. So that's what we did. At that time there wasn't much competition for these search queries either which was great.</p>
<p>This is a screenshot of some of the data for med school and Lund University. One of the most popular universities in Sweden. It may be hard for a non Swede to understand what the data means. But that's not important here. The important thing is that we created pages with hundreds of words, graphs and tables all automatically generated.</p>
<p><img src="https://mocki.io/antagningspoang.png" alt="Swedish SAT" title="Med school Lund"></p>
<h3 id="could-this-be-considered-spam">Could This Be Considered Spam?</h3>
<p>If you use this tactic in the wrong way with randomized data or just non useful information it's not good. But we knew that this was data people really wanted to find! All the generated texts were useful and provided great user value. And modern day search engine optimization really comes down to providing great value for a <strong>user</strong>.</p>
<p>This was all confirmed when Google started picking up the pages and loved them. We quickly started ranking on all sorts of keywords related to SAT. In just a couple of weeks we reached traffic numbers of around 10 000 users per month and it kept steadily increasing each day. All user metrics were amazing. Long average time spent on page and many interactions with the graphs. We also noticed people visiting several different pages because they got hooked on seeing all the different graphs we provided.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-step">The Final Step</h3>
<p>So we had suddenly created our own traffic source with relevant users. We started putting up banners on the site with the SAT data leading directly to our SAT prep SaaS. The results were great! We got a lot of signups and had to go back working on our course platform since the users discovered bugs and other problems. But we now had a steady flow of new paying customers. That's where you want to be because that is when a SaaS becomes fun.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-you-use-open-data-apis-to-do-the-same">How Can You Use Open Data Apis to Do the Same?</h3>
<p>This strategy may not be applicable for every service out there. But I will try to create one other example where I think this could work.</p>
<p>Lets say you own a snow shoveling business and you are currently expanding to a lot of different cities. Then I think you could combine this strategy with using local SEO.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use an open API to get all cities in your country with more than x amount of people</li>
<li>Try to find some weather API providing detailed data about if its going to snow</li>
<li>Try to find historical snow data for every city.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what can we do with with this data? We can generate something like the following text</p>
<p>“What is the snow situation town X right now? - Snow shoveling forecast”,</p>
<p>“Town with X with Y inhabitants usually has around Z number of snow days per year. The temperature in September to February is between K degrees. On our snow and ice scale town X has the score of S (scould be calculated by an algorithm that you create). You will probably have to shovel snow around D days per winter.”</p>
<p>“It's currently heavily snowing in town X, so be prepared to shovel snow the next D days.”</p>
<p>Each page would be both useful and kind of unique. It's important to make sure to have enough variables as Google might think its duplicate content otherwise. When you have created these pages you now have a local snow shoveling page for a lot of cities. Put up your phone number or a link to your booking system and start scaling your snow shoveling business.</p>
<p>There are probably a lot of better examples, but I hope I gave you enough to get thinking :)</p>
<h3 id="create-an-open-api-and-start-sharing-your-data">Create an Open API and Start Sharing Your Data!</h3>
<p>If you are a government, organization or just a company with some great data set you should think about sharing it. In some cases the data is your business and then it's of course not the best idea. But in a lot of cases there is not much to lose. In Scandinavia where Mocki is founded the governments are currently doing great efforts to make data publicly available. There are a lot of applications that will never be developed by governments and state organizations but that companies or hobby programmers would love to create.</p>
<p>Lets say your government would release all the data on every traffic accident in your country, including the location and severity. Then you could create an app warning about historically dangerous roads. It's these types of things that become possible when the data is released to the public.</p>
<p>With Mocki it's very easy to create a simple API with mock data or real data. You can for example use Mocki if you want to make some of you data available to a hackathon or other event. It's a good and safe start as you wouldn't need to expose any of your own infrastructure or sensitive data sources. If that sounds interesting you can sign up with GitHub or send us a message to the bottom right.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

    <p>With Mozilla Corporation laying off about 350 employees since the beginning of 2020, things don't look bright for Firefox, the only cross-platform browser providing any alternative to Google's Chrome(ium) monopoly. While they're not going away for the next few years at least, I believe it is also clear that they need to diversify their income pretty urgently. Here's how I hope to see them bouncing back.</p><h2 id="mozilla-foundation-vs-mozilla-corporation">Mozilla Foundation vs. Mozilla Corporation</h2><p>Since I see the confusion around this happening way too often, I want to start off by explaining the difference between the Mozilla Foundation (MoFo) and the Mozilla Corporation (MoCo).</p><p>MoCo was created as a subsidiary of the MoFo almost exactly 15 years ago. It's in charge of developing all the Mozilla's products: Firefox, Pocket, and others. All of its profits are going straight to MoFo, and nobody else owns any part of it (no other shareholders, no stocks, no dividents).</p><p>This structure allows MoCo to pursue business partnerships and deals that are hard or impossible to do in a non-profit, but as a consequence, you can't donate money to a corporation. That's why the donations to Mozilla go to the Foundation, which mostly does advocacy, finances fellowships, and similar, meaning that you can't donate directly to the Firefox development.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I was a Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellow in 2017/2018, during which I was an employee of <a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/">Bits of Freedom <i></i></a>, with my sallary being sponsored by the by MoFo and the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/">Ford Foundation <i></i></a>.</p><br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-you-can-give-money-to-the-mozilla-corporation-today">How you can give money to the Mozilla Corporation today</h2><p>MoCo currently has three B2C (business-to-consumer) products that you can purchase.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The oldest of them is <a href="https://getpocket.com/premium">Pocket Premium <i></i></a> ($4.99/month). While Pocket is definitely more than usable without paying anything, it has some features that are exclusive to its premium members. Since Pocket is owned by the MoCo (which is itself owned by MoFo), money spent towards its premium account counts as a revenue gained by the corporation that's in charge of developing Firefox.</p>
<p>The second B2C product a newly-released <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">Mozilla VPN <i></i></a> (also $4.99/month), currently available in only 6 countries (the US, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, Signapore, and Malasyia), though that list should expand later in the year.</p>
<p>The last one is <a href="https://fpn.firefox.com/">Firefox Private Network</a> ($2.99), which is more like a proxy than a VPN. If you decide to use it, all of your Firefox traffic gets routed through some Cloudflare server (you can't choose your location like you can with a VPN). It's currently only available in the US.</p>
<p>All in all, Mozilla would need quite a large amount of paid users to support their development. Then there are other smaller, free-to-use products:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://monitor.firefox.com/">Firefox Monitor <i></i></a>, which checks if some of your email addresses were a part of some breach (in cooperation with <a https:="" input.sh="" mozilla-subscription-service-pack="" href="">Have I Been Pwned <i></i></a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/lockwise/">Firefox Lockwise <i></i></a>, which is a password manager rivalling the likes of Bitwarden, LastPass, 1password, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://send.firefox.com/">Firefox Send <i></i></a>, which is an end-to-end encrypted file sharing web service. (Note: at the time of writing this, Mozilla shut it down because it was increasingly used for Malware transfer, but they're planning on bringing it back online.)</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notes-by-firefox/">Firefox Notes <i></i></a>, an experimental end-to-end encrypted note taking app that allows you to take notes on your desktop and your Android/iOS device.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I've seen many people suggesting that Mozilla Corporation should abandon these smaller projects to focus exclusively on Firefox. I, however, believe that they should double down on these smaller projects.</p><h2 id="the-service-pack">The service pack</h2><p>I could see a future in which Mozilla has a bunch of freemium online services that would enhance the online experience of its users. Similarly to Pocket, they could add more features to these smaller projects and hide some of them behind a paywall.</p><p>I could also see them bundling those premium features together across products into one service pack behind the Firefox brand, effectively making a Firefox Power Pack.</p><p>Firefox, on its own, would still be free and open to everyone to use with no payment necessary, but you can optionally boost your online experience and support Firefox's development by paying for the app pack.</p><p>The biggest advantage of this approach is that they could charge more than their currently do in their B2C products. Throughout the years, I've payed $13-20/month for the services that Mozilla's already offering. If I were to switch all of those subscriptions to a brand I can get behind, I can see myself paying quite a bit for them.</p><ul><li>I'd pay $15/month right now if there was an option to do that.</li><li>I'd pay up to $25/month if they double down on this approach and offer more features across their current services.</li></ul><p>Since I can't do that today, the least I could do is re-subscribe to Pocket Premium, which I have proudly done while writing this:</p><figure><img src="https://input.sh/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png" alt="A screenshot of me completing the signup to Pocket's Premium service." srcset="https://input.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png 600w, https://input.sh/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png 962w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Unfortunately, the country I'm in right now is not currently supported by their other B2C products, so please Mozilla, take more of my money!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mindflash.org/coding/learn-programming/the-proper-way-to-learn-as-a-beginner-programmer-57" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">Practice makes perfect</a>. I repeat it in a lot of my blog posts because of how important it is and is key to learning any programming language effectively. I think the best way to practice is by making personal projects, because they are long exercises rather than just a few functions, and they can also be a great contribution to your resume!</p>



<p>There are plenty of lists of projects to do to improve, but one thing that I never liked about them is that they always propose some generic, uninteresting and useless project that you will throw away once you are done with it. It’s already very hard to complete personal projects, so it’s a recipe for failure if you start with a personal project that you don’t care about deeply.</p>



<p>In this article I will present a list of 7 (and a half) personal projects that can help you improve at programming, or to learn a new language, but that you can also keep and develop after, because they actually bring you value outside of just programming skills.</p>



<h2>Make a personal resume website</h2>



<p>I think making a website to present your profile to potential employers is a great way to start out with personal projects. It’s a project that is easy to accomplish because theoretically it only requires HTML &amp; CSS skills. At the same time you can add a lot of technologies on top, depending on what you want to present.</p>



<p>The content to put in your website is pretty much the same as you resume: work and school experiences, a list of your skills, and a presentation of your personal projects. The advantage is that you have much more space on your website than on a one-page resume, and you can use more medium like pictures. I would also recommend adding a contact form, so that people can reach out directly.</p>

<figcaption><em>The (slightly outdated) skills section on my own resume website</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Your resume website can also be the opportunity to spend some time on the graphic design aspect of it. It’s important down the line, because even if we are writing code, we are building software for people, and user experience matters. Great code that nobody uses because of a bad UI is useless.</p>



<p>You will practice <strong>HTML, CSS, UI / UX design</strong>, and potentially <strong>JavaScript</strong> and the <strong>backend </strong>programming language of your choice. You will also learn how to host a website and things related to that. Software engineering isn’t limited to coding, and you will need at least basic skills in system administration and networking in your career.</p>



<h2>Add a blog to your resume website</h2>



<p>Once your resume website is ready, or even during its development, you can go further and start building a blog. You could use WordPress, like I do for MindFlash, but if the goal is to improve your skills, a custom-made one will be better. You will also be able to integrate it better with the design of your CV website.</p>



<p>A blog is a good idea for multiple reasons:</p>



<ul><li><span>You will learn how to structure your thoughts when explaining technical aspects, which will be invaluable later for your job, when you have to write design documents, tutorials for your team, and technical documentation for your code.</span></li><li>You can build your “personal brand”. Especially if you don’t have a common name, it’s easy to rank on Google and it’ll be the first thing that people can see when they search your name,</li><li>You can share your knowledge. It’s a rewarding experience to know that some people enjoyed your teachings. I wrote a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://medium.com/@antwaneb/catch-and-handle-all-404-errors-from-your-webservice-in-angular-5-2269b717d78f" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">tutorial on Medium</a> about some topic on Angular and I was ecstatic to see that someone linked it to solve a problem in a Github issue!</li></ul>



<p>For technical aspects, you will again have to deal with HTML &amp; CSS, but this time a backend programming language will be mandatory. On top of that, you will see new concepts, since you will need to use a database, and you will also have to manage permissions, with a “writer” account that is the only one allowed to post articles.</p>



<p>You could even separate the frontend and the backend, and start building a microservices infrastructure. It is overkill for a basic project, but if it fits the technologies you want to learn, it’s a good choice. For example, you can use Angular for your frontend, and it will call a backend API written in PHP with a framework.</p>



<h2>A script using the Spotify API to detect new albums of your favorite artists</h2>



<p>Back when I was around 15 years old, I made a script that called the Deezer and Spotify APIs to check all the new releases from my artists. Spotify sends emails for the major releases from artists you follow, but they don’t do it for all releases, and it’s easy to miss news albums.</p>



<p>Both platforms provide an easy to use and very complete API that you can call to get a large number of information about the data they have. You can access the documentation for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Spotify API</a>, which will guide you through the different endpoints that you can use.</p>



<p>An example workflow for your application would be to authenticate your account, then retrieve the list of artists you follow, and finally run queries to get the list of albums they have released. The next step would be to compare this list to a database, or even just a file, to check which are the releases you haven’t heard of yet.</p>



<p>This project can take many forms, it could be a website, or just a script ran by a scheduled task, and you will have a wide range of available technologies to use.</p>



<p>Beside the programming language that you will use to make this, you will learn how to call a public API. You can explore different ways to notify you of the new albums, by sending a notification to your desktop, an email, or maybe even a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://www.twilio.com/sms" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">text message</a> to your phone!</p>



<h2>A custom homepage aggregating news from your favorite sources</h2>



<p>For this one, you will be able to leverage other personal projects that you might do, or have done already, such as the Spotify “new albums notifier”. The goal is to gather all the news sources that you like in a single homepage, for your desktop, or your web browser.</p>



<p>To do that, you will have to create multiple separate modules that will handle different types of data sources, and aggregate them in a database:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>RSS feeds</strong></a>. They are XML “files” that are used a lot by blogs and other news sources, and you can subscribe to get to get notifications when a new story is published. There are plenty of open source XML parsing libraries online, so it will be the occasion to learn how to use 3rd party libraries. Actually, this blog offers an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mindflash.org/feed" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">RSS feed</a> with the latest articles!</li><li><strong>HTML pages</strong>. For those, you will need to manually parse (well, using a library) HTML tags to extract the information you need from the website, which means that you will need one specific module for each website to parse.</li><li><strong>APIs</strong>. Again, if you want to get your latest albums from Spotify, you would use a public API offered by the service, but many other big websites offer similar services, like Instagram or Facebook.</li></ul>



<p>Think about any of the websites you consult daily, and how you could extract those information to then feed them in your database and display them on your custom homepage.</p>



<p>This project can really be an opportunity to put in place multiple microservices, each responsible to extract one type of information and then inject it in a central database. This is a good use case for <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">AWS Lambdas</a> for example.</p>



<h2>A platform to track your job applications, cover letters and resumes</h2>



<p>If you are looking for a job, you will have to apply to many places. When I was looking for my end-of-studies internship 2 years ago, I applied to over 60 job offers, and that’s really not that many.</p>



<p>It can get pretty tricky to track all of those applications, and also time consuming to maintain an excel sheet, write the potential cover letters for each company, adapt your resume in some cases, and update the status of all those. For this, I suggest you create a website or a software where you can submit the companies that you applied to, a link to the job posting, and the status of those applications.</p>



<p>Then, you can go a lot further and build on top of that, a system to automatically generate for you, based on a template, a cover letter and a resume adapted to the company that you are applying for. Most of the parts of those documents will be common, but you can have a text box where you input specific details and it gets integrated into your template automatically. You could even email the recruiter automatically.</p>



<p>I think this project is a good opportunity to follow a real development process, where you will define the functionalities you want to integrate, make diagrams for the different features (you can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mindflash.org/coding/quick-and-easy-uml-diagrams-with-plantuml-499" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">use PlantUML to easily make UML diagrams</a>) and make sure you have an idea of what the application will look like before starting to build it.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/PLAnRiCW5Dpv2kGnZOVk7M8vf2LAi8LHeauMTMXZoM3BnfMYjlzU9nW2BHDtx-uzTBpLe7clHza0K3Ly663Qoewh2_m2yA7GVQq-eE9IW1zmha_2bQNGv_OqM5VITKrTSLstodUEVMEDlkAFcGdPDLmB8xJ8gKBslHRDtRfkgr4AfOt8ej3gsD1AnJ3HHcBkeMtcGbFQVef-9xGMlSt34Q7TBzWUGeqIRjitTkd4DQRfOC8G9SKBpfStpD0-psX2NmtC4Tqd115cOxHk5-6jPw6v7eUv9SbOcUJv3gErQN9CCCFakTnaj4n8SKHqUPzzmEXO69njDeYM5AK87z3wHb6qHIcRm3n-7kIcksoVlkFOHXgIVcJk5wF72CPn2oCLtVyG-3jY58jGuGkkHVESV_GS4W1sMnVJEpmH060br6dQ-by0" alt="An example of UML for a application to manage resume" width="414" height="388"><figcaption><em>An quick example of UML I made for this application</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Scripts to automatize repetitive tasks</h2>



<p>A few years ago there was a story that got heavily <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://www.thejournal.ie/programmer-scripts-to-do-his-job-email-his-wife-2469028-Jan2016/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">shared in the news</a> where a programmer made a bunch of scripts to automatize a few repetitive and annoying tasks. He automatized the coffee machine of his office to pour it exactly over the time he took him to reach the machine from his desk, he made a script that automatically restored a database backup when he was receiving an email from a specific customer with the word “problem” in the title, etc. You can see those scripts, amongst others, on a Github repository called <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">hacker-scripts</a>.</p>



<p>I won’t say that I totally believe that this story is true, but you get the idea. You can automatize tasks to run them automatically on a schedule you decide, or on demand. Those scripts will depend heavily on what you need, but here are a few ideas:</p>



<ul><li>Bulk renaming of your pictures. If you are taking a lot of photos, it’s to rename them by date instead of using the default IMG_2042.jpg.</li><li>Automatically backup your files. Make a script that listens to a local folder and automatically uploads to Dropbox any file that you put in the folder.</li><li>Your “custom homepage” that I mentioned earlier could also be a …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>Last May, I  discovered that a critical vulnerability I had reported earlier this year had resulted in my first CVE. Since the combination of vulnerabilities that led to this unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) was pretty fun to discover, I want to share the story about how brute force enabled me to hack into two organizations’ Active Directory-linked systems.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I did a thing! Found a pretty cool chain of vulnerabilities leading to RCE. Go and be patching your ADSelfService. 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/ZEybiAnpIg">https://t.co/ZEybiAnpIg</a></p>— Pieter Hiele (@honoki) <a href="https://twitter.com/honoki/status/1258122265989963781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2>The Target</h2>



<p>While performing some routine visual reconnaissance with <a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone">Aquatone</a>, I noticed a similar-looking login page on two different subdomains from unrelated bug bounty programs.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="703" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x703.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x703.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-300x206.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x527.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-700x480.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 1374w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Both subdomains contained customized versions of this default login screen.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The software behind this login screen is Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, which offers a portal that allows users to reset the password of their own Active Directory (AD) accounts. (Anybody who has worked in a large organization will recognize why this sounds like a useful thing to have.)</p>



<p>Since I figured that any bugs I would find on this product could potentially impact multiple companies, and more so, because it sounded very likely that this is linked to the organization’s Active Directory, it seemed like a good idea to spend some time here.</p>



<p>My first efforts led to discovering a few basic reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which had apparently been identified by other researchers already. So I had to dig a little deeper. Luckily, it turned out the whole product can be downloaded and installed as a trial for 30 days.</p>



<h2>The Setup</h2>



<p>Since I was convinced there would probably be more XSS vulnerabilities to find, I decided to download and install the software with the idea of browsing through the Java source code looking for more bugs.</p>



<p>Having installed the software, I now had the advantage of being able to execute all tests locally, as well as read through the source code to understand exactly what happens in the application, and even use <code>grep</code> in the installation folder to find potentially interesting files.</p>



<div><div><div><div><p><h5>Sidenote</h5></p><div><p>To reverse engineer Java applications, I like to use <a href="https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer">Bytecode Viewer</a>, which decompiles and formats Java class files into readable Java code. It also allows to edit byte code and recompile the file on the fly and works great to decompile Android APK files too.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="643" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x643.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x643.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-300x188.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-768x482.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-700x439.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3.png 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I started off manually browsing through some of the Java source files without many interesting discoveries. However, I did build an understanding of the software components and how they work together. This tends to be invaluable when looking for complex bugs in applications, so was definitely worth spending a couple of hours on. As a result, I had a pretty good picture of application features, the parts of the application that consisted mostly of legacy code vs. the parts that looked more recent, the parts that had been modified to fix previous security vulnerabilities, etc.</p>



<p>At one point, I decided to build a word list of application endpoints, which could hopefully serve two purposes: to perform some “classic” security tests directly against the endpoint, and to serve as a useful resource when targeting similar applications at some point in the future.</p>



<h2>The Bugs</h2>



<h4>1. Insecure deserialization in Java</h4>



<p>During my enumeration of the application’s endpoints, I spotted the following lines in one of the <code>web.xml</code> files:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="xml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
&lt;servlet-name&gt;CewolfServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
&lt;url-pattern&gt;/cewolf/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</pre>



<p>When I googled that, I found <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48176">a published RCE against a <code>cewolf</code> endpoint</a> on another ManageEngine product, using a path traversal in the <code>img</code> parameter – this looked very promising!</p>



<p>Sure enough, after manually placing a file in a folder on my local installation, I could confirm that the deserialization vulnerability also existed in this version of ADSelfService Plus by browsing to <code>http://localhost:8888/cewolf/?img=/../../../path/to/evil.file</code></p>



<p>This meant I had a ready-to-use Java deserialization vulnerability on the targeted sites, but I would only be able to exploit it if I found a way to upload arbitrary files to the server first. So the work wasn’t quite done yet.</p>



<h4>2. Arbitrary file upload</h4>



<p>Finding an arbitrary file upload vulnerability did not look like an easy challenge. To maximize my attack surface, I continued to configure the software on my machine, which required setting up a local Domain Controller and an Active Directory domain to play with.</p>



<p>Fast forward through hours of downloading ISOs, making space on HDDs, VMware Workstation shenanigans, Microsoft Windows Server administration and watching Youtube videos with titles like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRf_uU0vrMM&amp;t=773s">How to Set Up a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller</a>“, and I finally had a setup that allowed me to log in to the admin panel.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="445" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-1024x445.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-1024x445.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-300x130.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-768x334.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-700x304.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13.png 1469w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>I finally set up a working copy of ADSelfService Plus, time to hack.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With full admin access to the application, I could now further map out application features and API endpoints. For obvious reasons, I spent most of my time investigating all different upload features in the application, until I came across one feature that supported uploading a smartcard certificate configuration, resulting in a POST request to <code>/LogonCustomization.do?form=smartCard&amp;operation=Add</code></p>



<p>When I noticed that the uploaded certificate file was stored on the server’s file system without modifying the name, I figured that this might be the way forward to leverage the deserialization bug! So I traced this API call through the source code to find out more about possible ways to attack this.</p>



<p>On a high level, this is how that worked:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="888" height="410" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png 888w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-300x139.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-768x355.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-700x323.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"></figure>







<ol><li>A logged-in administrator can upload a smartcard configuration to <code>/LogonCustomization.do?form=smartCard&amp;operation=Add</code>;</li><li>This triggers a backend request to the server’s authenticated RestAPI on <code>/RestAPI/WC/SmartCard?HANDSHAKE_KEY=secret</code> using a secret handshake that is generated on the server side;</li><li>Before executing the requested action, the <code>HANDSHAKE_KEY</code> is validated against a second API endpoint on <code>/servlet/HSKeyAuthenticator?PRODUCT_NAME=ManageEngine+ADSelfService+Plus&amp;HANDSHAKE_KEY=secret</code> which returns <code>SUCCESS</code> or <code>FAILED</code> depending on the passed <code>secret</code>;</li><li>If successful, the uploaded certificate is written to <code>C:\ManageEngine\ADSelfService Plus\bin</code></li></ol>



<p>Interestingly, the <code>/RestAPI</code> endpoint was publicly accessible, so any request with a valid <code>HANDSHAKE_KEY</code> would bypass user authentication and be processed by the server.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the <code>/servlet/HSKeyAuthenticator</code> was also publicly accessible, allowing an unauthorized user to manually verify if an authentication secret was valid or not.</p>



<p>With this in mind, I returned to the now familiar source code.</p>



<h4>3. Bruteforceable authentication key </h4>



<p>I identified two interesting Java classes with some help from <code>grep</code>, and from my installation’s PostgreSQL database that contained a useful inventory of API endpoints and their authentication needs:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="711" height="459" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10.png 711w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10-300x194.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10-700x452.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px"><figcaption>Another benefit to local installations of software is full access to the underlying database.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A snippet from <code>HSKeyAuthenticator.class</code> in <code>com.manageengine.ads.fw.servlet</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="5-8" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
      try {
         String message = "FAILED";
         RestAPIKey.getInstance();
         String apiKey = RestAPIKey.getKey();
         String handShakeKey = request.getParameter("HANDSHAKE_KEY");
         if (handShakeKey.equals(apiKey)) {
            message = "SUCCESS";
         }

         PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
         response.setContentType("text/html");
         out.println(message);
         out.close();
      } catch (Exception var7) {
         HSKeyAuthenticator.out.log(Level.INFO, " ", var7);
      }

   }
</pre>



<p>And one from <code>RestAPIKey.class</code> in <code>package com.manageengine.ads.fw.api</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="3-4,11,13" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">  public static void generateKey()
  {
    Long cT = Long.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis());
    key = cT.toString();
    generatedTime = cT;
  }

  public static String getKey()
  {
    Long cT = Long.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis());
    if ((key == null) || (generatedTime.longValue() + 120000L &lt; cT.longValue()))
    {
      generateKey();
    }
    return key;
  }
</pre>



<p>As you can see from those pieces of code, the API authentication key of the server is set to the current time in milliseconds and has a lifespan of 2 minutes. This means that at any given moment, there are 120 000 possible authentication keys (120 seconds * 1000 milliseconds/second).</p>



<p>In other words, if I could generate at least 1000 requests per second consistently over a time span of 2 minutes, I would have a guaranteed hit at the moment the authentication key expired and regenerated. While that seems like a large number for a network-level attack, a successful attack is not necessarily beyond the realm of possibility. Especially keeping in mind that even at a lower than 100% success rate, and given sufficient time, a successful hit becomes more and more likely.</p>



<p>In practice, I quickly had a working proof-of-concept that would brute force my local instance’s secret in a matter of minutes.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="564" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-1024x564.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-1024x564.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-300x165.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-768x423.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-700x385.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6.png 1279w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Brute forcing the secret on my local instance worked a charm.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>However, when employing the script against a live target (i.e. over an <em>actual</em> internet connection), I wasn’t as lucky. I ran and reran the script with different configurations and settings for hours, and overnight without result, and was starting to fear my approach would have to be abandoned.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I got temporarily sidetracked because I wasn’t sure what time zone my target servers were running in. I ended up rerunning my script with multiple offsets from my own (CET) until I found out that Java’s <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis()">currentTimeMillis</a></code> apparently returns time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and I needn’t have bothered.</p>



<p>Eventually, after more trial and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Project managers who do resource management successfully reap more benefits in terms of better project outcomes and happier teams and clients.</p><div>
			
			<p>Resource Management is knowing how to utilize resources in an efficient way so projects get delivered on time, clients are happy with deliverables, teams don’t burn out, and there’s an actual profit at the end of it all.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_management" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> describes it as the efficient and effective development of an organization’s resources when they are needed.</p>

<p>Resource management can be applied to various aspects of a business in different industries, though it usually deals with Project Management. In other words, for the purpose of this article, let’s stick with Project Resource Management.</p>

<p>Resources can be intangible, like People and Time, and tangible, like Cash and Technology. Each aspect needs to be managed properly so they’re available and not diminishing, as they overlap in the process.</p>

<p>With the ever increasing trend of #WFH (working from home) and <a href="https://claritask.com/blog/working-remotely">remote work</a>, which a lot of successful companies big and small have recently adopted, it’s more crucial than ever to do project resource management right.</p>

<h2>Something you’ve already been doing</h2>
<p>Chances are, if you are a project manager, you’ve already been doing project resource management. The important part is to be aware of it and its techniques, which in turn will help you catapult ahead and become an irreplaceable “wizard” project manager of sorts.</p>

<p>Here are some real life examples:</p>

<h3>Content Marketing Firms</h3>
<p>If you are a content marketing firm, you will need writers and time to get the job done. Sometimes you may have less time for each of one of your writers, in which case you may get your client to agree on a smaller scope with a potentially similar impact. Other times, you may have the time, but less writers on hand. Knowing how to handle these situations is key in doing project resource management the right way.</p>

<h3>Web Design Firms</h3>
<p>In a web design firm, you’ll need web designers, front and back-end developers, technology (servers, framework of choice), writers. Each one of these resources (people mostly) needs to be arranged so they work in sync, and no part of the project is delayed. You may start with the design first (web designers), however your front and back-end developers should not be waiting around. They might be finishing up another project as the UI design is being completed in a new project, in which case they can start fresh right after.</p>

<h3>Advertising Agencies</h3>
<p>At an ad agency, you will have designers, copywriters, ad producers (usually third parties: cameras, editors), and clients to manage. It’s a wide skill set that requires a ton of flexibility, facilitation, understanding, and zen like traits, so you don’t lose your mind by mid-March.</p>

<h2>A Well oiled machine</h2>
<p>As you can see, this dance needs to be choreographically refined if your goal is to run a profitable business with a happy productive team behind it.</p>

<p>Now you don’t need to run everything as a Swiss watch, even though that should be the aspiration, but you may run the risk of burning out your team and not having them “fresh” for next projects in line.</p>

<p>In other words it’s OK for your team to slack around from time to time. <strong>Example:</strong> Your front-end developer might go at full speed as they’re delivering a project. And once the next week rolls in, they can do a bit of maintenance on older projects, while “waiting around” for the UI designer to get done with their part. This way they’re resting actively, recharging their batteries, and getting ready for the next sprint. In our line of work it’s a long marathon made up of many sprints and active rests.</p>

<blockquote><p>As your team grows and learns working with one another. They’ll unknowingly lend you a hand and manage themselves, while always understanding what’s to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Micromanaging is something you want to avoid as your team grows, not just in numbers but in wisdom. Your aim is to let go of direction. Running a synergized team that understands the overall goal is where you want to be.</p>

<p>At the core of it, project resource management is “energy management”. You want to manage your finite energy, or rather your team’s finite energy. The intent should always be to let it replenish and go again at it the next time around.</p>

<h2>What about transparency?</h2>
<p>A lot of firms employ transparency about every bit of their project. Some go down into detail and share every aspect of it. While we at Claritask like to run things transparently, we believe that way too much of it can backfire and inundate some of your team members. We’re not suggesting “you hide” things from your team. Information should be freely available across the board. But, there are times when junior team-members could easily be intimidated by the overall scope and importance of your project. As they keep growing into seniority, they’ll naturally want to know more about how their contribution affects the overall project. It’s always best to let team members grow into the transparency they desire rather than throw every bit of information at them and run the risk of burning them out early on.</p>

<h2>Companies big and small</h2>
<p>Bigger firms have the actual resources to hire a “resource manager”. For the rest of us, it’s a skill we must hone as we manage projects on a daily basis. Being a project manager that does resource management well, gives you the rare super power not just to delegate tasks but when and how to delegate them.</p>

<p>In smaller companies, where project scope and pace might change on a weekly basis, you need to know when to take someone out of the project or shuffle them out entirely on a different deliverable. You want to do this gracefully or you may risk losing their trust next time around. This bit is called “Resource Leveling”: a technique that aims at discovering unused capacities of a team member. Let’s say someone in your team is a developer but they know a thing or two about UI design. You can quickly borrow this secondary skill they have and deliver your project on time.</p>

<h2>The hard truth</h2>
<p><strong>The bottom line is this:</strong> You are not <a href="https://claritask.com/blog/the-way-to-becoming-a-good-project-manager">a complete project manager</a> without the skillset of a resource manager. In other words, managing a project doesn’t mean just allocating tasks as they come in, without the sense of how things are moving forward, what tools you have left, how much time is at your disposal, and who from your team you have available at any given time.</p>

<h2>At the core of it, successful project resource management:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keeps everyone happy, so your and your team’s hair is not constantly on fire.</li>
<li>Gives you margin to try something new if things don’t work out the way you had planned initially.</li>
<li>Creates trust in your team. Lets your team know that you’re on their side by allocating resources and making their well-being a priority. <strong>Happy team = Successful project outcomes.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Resource managing “people” as a key aspect of any projects</h2>
<p>Tangible things like Cash and Technology can be easily measured. People, on the other hand, are unpredictable. Not on a personal level, but things that happen around them. A successful project manager is always aware of their team’s biorhythm.</p>

<p>At times a specific team member may struggle with a single task because of the stress with the overall scope of the project. An empathic project manager will understand this and nudge them ever so slightly towards inspiration and motivate them to come up with an easier solution.</p>

<blockquote><p>As you develop these skills, you’ll have a better sense of seeing problems before they surface. You’ll learn how to somewhat predict the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the best ways to understand how to “resource manage” your team is knowing what’s coming up for them in the near future. One way to do this in Claritask is via the “MY TASKS” section in which you can quickly view everyone’s load at one glance.</p>

<p>Being a successful project resource manager it makes your job easier. It helps you become a great leader as you move each chess piece confidently and with less risk, because you’ve created the necessary margins before the project even started.</p>

<p>This way you’ll deliver more projects on time, have happier clients, make more dollars per hours spent, and become known as a company that makes magic happen by delivering stellar work with less resources available.</p>

<p><strong>If we want to leave one thing with you at the end of this article is this:</strong> The key to successful project resource management is to run a lean operation and do more with less waste along the way.</p>

<h3>Break someone’s code today!</h3><p>On September 1st of 2000 Damian Conway sent a proposal №188, promoting the idea of Private Keys and Methods.</p><p>In those days, Perl’s object-oriented programming relied heavily on hashes. Indeed, a hash can store data values by keys, as well as  references to routines, which is how you can describe an object with data attributes and methods. With bits of syntax sugar here and there one can make shortcuts to work with such an object’s state and behavior.</p><p>So can be done in Raku nowadays:</p><pre id="advent-code-fdb55dec-8cdf-4465-89e6-a64a01297843"><table>

Who would tell the answer without mighty <code>DateTime</code>?</p><p>So you hurry up and do a little patch:</p><pre id="advent-code-43ef2248-5fe5-4111-b2f7-8749a9741cee"><table>

It gives you means to divide your coding efforts into a couple of different realms, one of which has “Nobody but I can use this” policy and its opposite takes the famous “Use it as you please and we will try really, really hard not to break anything knowingly” stance.</p><p>While encapsulation by itself is not a Great Code Problems Solver (you can write scary code anyways!) nor it reduces the amount of bugs (as if it happens!), but it certainly can save you some nerves during rewriting code (which sometimes is a Great Way To Solve Problems) and reduces coupling between components (which does reduce the amount of bugs, right? Hope never dies).</p><p>Here, inspired by the <code>Tie::SecureHash</code> module approach, Damian Conway has proposed a way to support encapsulation in a hash-based object-y system.</p><h3>Sugar – the keyword way</h3><p>The proposal describes a unary function named <code>private</code>, which can be applied to a single hash entry, a slice of entries or a whole hash:</p><pre id="advent-code-922ff4d7-0f96-4ebf-b620-d3383d9fe9e7"><table>

<h3>Conclusion: Huffmanize it!</h3>

<p>Raku wisdom says “Huffmanize your syntax”, as mighty Huffman coding it tells you to make things which are common to type easier to type.</p><p>With the Raku object system being ground up overhauled, the question of encapsulation was not forgotten! Not! In! A! Bit! (sorry for all the line noise you just heard).</p>

<p>Private things in Raku are marked with an exclamation mark. Firstly, it indicates to the reader those code bits are important. Secondly, for attributes it serves as a secondary “sigil”, namely “twigil”, which tells the reader that some interesting scoping is involved here. Thirdly, it looks like it has some class. Fourthly… Do you really expect more reasons here? Please, come up with your ideas in the comments!</p><p>Using Raku for some years, it suddenly strikes with a simple consistency here:</p><pre id="advent-code-e041a903-314f-48ac-a379-d7ea49cce3f1"><table>

Fireballs shoot from their hands; the hero is revived from an endless slumber; a couple falls in love. We smile when we hear such stories. They seem quaint but implausible. Common sense tells us that merely speaking certain words, or inscribing certain symbols, cannot cause such changes in the world. And yet our scientific theories are not so different. By speaking the words or inscribing the symbols of such a theory, we can greatly deepen our understanding of the world. That new understanding then enables us to change the world in ways that formerly seemed impossible, even inconceivable. Consider quantum mechanics, one of our deepest theories. It has helped us create lasers, semiconductor chips, and magnetic resonance imaging. One day it will likely help us create quantum computers, perhaps even quantum intelligences. Quantum mechanics is magic that actually works.</p><p>In this essay, we explain quantum mechanics in detail. We will describe all the principles of quantum mechanics in depth, nothing held back. It's not a handy-wavy treatment, of the kind often found in articles written for a general audience. While such articles can be entertaining, trying to learn quantum mechanics by reading them is like learning to play basketball by merely watching basketball being played. This essay will get you out on the mathematical court of quantum mechanics. Of course, you won't learn to slam dunk, at least not yet. But the essay will ground you in an understanding of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, which you can later build upon and extend.</p><p>To read the essay, you must first understand the quantum circuit model of quantum computation. If you're not familiar with quantum circuits, you can learn about them from our earlier essay, <a href="https://quantum.country/qcvc">Quantum Computing for the Very Curious</a>. You may wish to pause to read that essay now, if you haven't already. Once you've understood that material you shouldn't need any other prerequisites. Indeed, when you learned quantum computing, you learned in passing almost all of quantum mechanics. In <a href="#postulates">Part I</a> of this essay we distill those past ideas, collecting them up into the package known as quantum mechanics.</p><p>Although quantum mechanics is not so difficult to learn, it's a theory which has disturbed many people. Here's a few classic quotes on this puzzlement:</p><blockquote><p><em>I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics … Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, “But how can it be like that?” because you will get “down the drain”, into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that. </em>– Richard Feynman</p><p><em>I have thought a hundred times as much about the quantum problems as I have about general relativity theory.</em> – Albert Einstein</p><p><em>If quantum mechanics hasn't profoundly shocked you, you haven't understood it yet.</em> – Niels Bohr</p></blockquote><p>If quantum mechanics is not so difficult to learn, why has it so disturbed many great physicists? What do they mean when they say they don't understand it, or are shocked by it? How can a scientific theory be both beautiful and disturbing? In <a href="#trouble-with-qm">Part II</a> of this essay we'll explore these questions. As we'll see, despite its simplicity quantum mechanics raises striking conceptual problems, problems which are among the most exciting open problems in science today.</p><p>The essay is presented in an unusual form. It's an example of what we call a <em>mnemonic essay</em>, written in the <em>mnemonic medium</em>. That means it incorporates new user interface elements intended to make it almost effortless for you to remember and apply the ideas in the essay. The motivator is that most people (ourselves included) quickly forget much of what we read in books and articles. The mnemonic medium takes advantage of what cognitive scientists know about how humans learn, creating an interface which ensures you'll remember the ideas and how to apply them near permanently. More on how that works below.</p><p>So, what is quantum mechanics? It's fun to wax poetic about it being magic that actually works, or to quote eminent scientists saying no-one really understands it. But while fun, those statements give no direct enlightenment. What is quantum mechanics, really?</p><p>Quantum mechanics is simply this: it's a set of four postulates that provide a mathematical framework for describing the universe and everything in it. These postulates reflect ideas you've already seen in the quantum circuit model: how to describe a quantum state; how to describe the dynamics of a quantum system; and so on. But rather than talk abstractly, it's better to just see the first postulate:</p><h2 id="first-postulate-qm">The first postulate: state space</h2><blockquote><strong>Postulate 1:</strong> Associated to any physical system is a complex vector space known as the <em>state space</em> of the system. If the system is isolated, then the system is completely described by its <em>state vector</em>, which is a unit vector in the system's state space.</blockquote><p>This may seem densely written, but you already know most of it. In particular, we've been working extensively with qubits, and we've seen this postulate in action. For a qubit the state space is, as you know, a two-dimensional complex vector space. The state is a unit vector in that state space (i.e., has length <span><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>)</span>. And the condition that the state vector is a unit vector expresses the idea that the probabilities for the outcomes of a computational basis measurement add up to <span><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.</span></p><p>It's not just qubits that have a state space. The first postulate of quantum mechanics tells us that <em>every</em> physical system has a state space. An atom has a state space; a human being has a state space; even the universe as a whole has a state space. Admittedly, the first postulate doesn't tell us what the state space is, for any given physical system. That needs to be figured out on a case-by-case basis. Different types of atoms have different state spaces; a human being has a different (and much more complicated) state space; the universe has a more complicated state space still.</p><p>As an example, suppose you're interested in what happens when you shine light on an atom. To give a quantum mechanical description, you'd need a state space to describe atoms and the electromagnetic field (i.e., light). <em>A priori</em> it's not obvious what that state space should be. How many dimensions should the state space have? How do particular physical configurations of atoms and light correspond to states in that state space? By itself, quantum mechanics doesn't answer these questions. It merely does the subtle-but-important job of instructing you to look for answers to these questions. Fortunately, there is a theory, known as quantum electrodynamics (often shortened to QED), which describes how atoms and light interact. Among other things, QED tells us which states and state spaces to use to give quantum descriptions of atoms and light.</p><p>In a similar way, suppose we're trying to describe particles like quarks or the Higgs boson. Just as with the atoms-and-light example, quantum mechanics tells us we need figure out the right state spaces and state vectors. But it doesn't tell us what those are. In this case, the additional theory needed is the standard model of particle physics. Like QED, the standard model sits on top of basic quantum mechanics, fleshing it out, telling us things which aren't in the four postulates of quantum mechanics.</p><p>More generally, quantum mechanics alone isn't a fully specified physical theory. Rather, it's a framework to use to construct physical theories (like QED). It's helpful to think of quantum mechanics as analogous to an operating system for a computer. On its own, the operating system doesn't do all the user needs. Rather, it's a framework that accomplishes important housekeeping functions, creating a file system, a graphical display and interface, and so on. But users need another layer of application software on top of those basic functions. That application layer is analogous to physical theories like QED and the standard model. The application layer runs within the framework provided by the operating system, but isn't itself part of the operating system<span>This analogy was popularized in Scott Aaronson's book “Quantum Computing Since Democritus”; MN believes Scott first heard it in a <a href="https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/av/audio/00-01/quantum_computing/nielsen1.mp3">talk</a> MN gave at the Fields Institute in Toronto in 2001. This wouldn't warrant mention, except when MN uses the analogy, people often respond “oh yes, that's Scott Aaronson's way of thinking about quantum mechanics”. MN doesn't recall where he first heard it, or if the description is original.</span>.</p><p>In this essay, we won't get deeply into QED or the standard model or the other theories physicists have developed to describe particular physical systems. Rather, our focus is on quantum mechanics itself – the four postulates. For examples, we'll mostly draw on the quantum circuit model, which makes simple and reasonable assumptions about state spaces and state vectors. This model is already an extremely rich arena for studying quantum mechanics. If you wish, you can learn later about QED, the standard model, and so on.</p><p>Of course, this means there is still much more to learn, beyond the scope of this essay. Each physical system requires learning its own particular set of recipes for state spaces and state vectors. You already know some such recipes: if we say “let's consider a 3-qubit system”, then we know the state space is just the 8-dimensional complex vector space spanned by the computational basis states <span><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|0\rangle|0\rangle|0\rangle</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>,</span> <span><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo><mo>…</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|0\rangle|0\rangle|1\rangle, \ldots</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.</span> By contrast, you probably don't know the recipe QED gives telling us how to construct the state space for a couple of hydrogen atoms interacting with the electromagnetic field<span>A little more strictly speaking, QED tells us how charged elementary particles like electrons interact with the electromagnetic field.

          <p>Languages are often judged initially on their "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">Hello,
world!</a>" program.
How easy is it to write? To run? How easy is it to understand? It's a very
simple program, of course, one of the simplest, even... just produce a little
text, and display it, what could be simpler?</p>
<p>It's really not fair to judge a language by such a cursory impression, but it
<em>can</em> give you an idea of what a language <em>values</em> and how it works. What does
the syntax look like? Is it typed? Is it interpreted? You can usually tell a
lot at a glance.</p>
<p>For example, One of Ruby's (many) hello worlds is so simple, it's also Python!</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>'Hello world!'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Often, people coming from interpreted languages experience compiled, systems
languages to be more complicated right off the bat. There is the obvious added
complexity of compiling and running being separate steps, as opposed to simply
pointing an executable at some source code and seeing a result right away, but
there are often syntactical constructs to go along with that...</p>
<p>At first glance, Rust's hello world looks fairly inert, as well:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
    <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>println!</code> is actually a macro, what does it look like expanded?</p>
<pre><code><span>macro_rules!</span> println {
    () =&gt; ($crate::<span>print!</span>(<span>"\n"</span>));
    ($($arg:tt)*) =&gt; ({
        $crate::io::_print($crate::format_args_nl!($($arg)*));
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that this <em>also</em> has a macro <em>inside of it.</em> This matches on the
second case (because there is an argument present) and calls into
<code>$crate::format_args_nl!</code> and passes the result of that to <code>$crate::io::_print</code></p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>_print</span></span>(args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;) {
    print_to(args, &amp;LOCAL_STDOUT, stdout, <span>"stdout"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>which calls into <code>print_to</code>, which looks like</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>print_to</span></span>&lt;T&gt;(
    args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;,
    local_s: &amp;<span>'static</span> LocalKey&lt;RefCell&lt;<span>Option</span>&lt;<span>Box</span>&lt;<span>dyn</span> Write + <span>Send</span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,
    global_s: <span><span>fn</span></span>() -&gt; T,
    label: &amp;<span>str</span>,
) <span>where</span>
    T: Write,
{
    <span>let</span> result = local_s
        .try_with(|s| {
            
            
            
            <span>let</span> prev = s.borrow_mut().take();
            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(<span>mut</span> w) = prev {
                <span>let</span> result = w.write_fmt(args);
                *s.borrow_mut() = <span>Some</span>(w);
                <span>return</span> result;
            }
            global_s().write_fmt(args)
        })
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| global_s().write_fmt(args));

    <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Err</span>(e) = result {
        <span>panic!</span>(<span>"failed printing to {}: {}"</span>, label, e);
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Which is, uh, well let's just say it's not exactly <em>simple</em> looking now? There
is a lot going on here!</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not faulting Rust here at all, my point is exactly the
opposite actually, in that there is <em>always</em> necessarily more going on in a
"Hello world!" than <code>puts "la de da"</code> or similar would have you believe on its
face. Speaking of Ruby's <code>puts</code>, what <em>is</em> the code that runs <code>puts</code> in the
Ruby interpreter itself, which is written in C?</p>
<p>Well it looks like <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/7c2bbd1c7d40a30583844d649045824161772e36/io.c#L7727-L7758">this</a></p>
<pre><code><span>VALUE

    <span>int</span> i, n;

        }

        }

      <span>string</span>:
        n = <span>0</span>;

            args[n++] = rb_default_rs;
        }
        rb_io_writev(out, n, args);
    }

    <span>return</span> Qnil;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>We all know that a languages like Ruby or Python are designed explicitly to
hide this sort of complexity from us and let us get on with the dirty business
of munging data blobs or serving web requests or solving sudokus or whatever,
and thank goodness for that, but wow that is <em>quite</em> a lot, isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<p>When people come from languages that were designed to be ergonomic to more
systems oriented languages, they're often jarred by what they perceive to be
code thatis inelegant, ugly, and verbose. To be sure, it sometimes <em>is</em> exactly
that... (although anyone who has worked with a "pretty" language in a production
codebase knows that those are not immune to these descriptors either).</p>
<p>Usually, the tradeoff is explicit: elegance and simplicity for
<em>control</em>...  specific and granular <em>control</em>, over the program that will
eventually be run.  It isn't always necessary, in fact it is almost always _un_necessary,
to have <em>that</em> much control over your program. Obviously, productivity matters,
and if your business is <em><em>insert viable business</em></em>, well it's likely that your
goals are not going to be optimally met by futzing with manual memory
management all day (<a href="https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/">at least from the macro level, in the general
sense</a>).</p>
<p>But what if you <em>do</em> need that control? Well then, <em>you need it</em>. When every
ounce of performance actually is necessary, or on embedded systems with hard
memory constraints, or when writing code for some bespoke or otherwise uncommon
processor.</p>
<p>I'm going to choose one language, Zig, and dive deep into its hello world, but
it is important to note here that my point is not primarily about Zig, it's
about how <em>all</em> languages have to contend with an enormous amount of complexity
in order to do <em>anything</em>, even the simplest of tasks like a hello world
program. Complexity that is, for the most part, hidden from us in our day to
day. So what in the hello world is <em>actually</em> going on then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll be using the most current minor release version of Zig: 0.6.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Let's take a walk</h2>
<p><a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>'s hello world looks like this, from the docs.:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
    <span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
    <span>try</span> stdout.print(<span>"Hello, {}!\n"</span>, .{<span>"world"</span>});
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you are new to zig, a quick word on this syntax before I get into the gritty
details.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><code>@import</code> is a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Builtin-Functions"><em>compiler
builtin</em></a> function
that assigns the namespace of the file it is referencing to the <code>const</code>
variable on the left hand side.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
  
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just like in C, <code>main</code> is a special function that marks the entry point to a
program after it has been compiled as an executable. Unlike in C, it accepts no
arguments (C's main function has a variety of vagaries that make it a bit
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4207223">unique</a>) and command line input is
available through utility functions to allow easier cross platform use.</p>
<p>It is marked <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Keyword-pub"><code>pub</code></a> so
that it is accessible from outside of the immediate module ('module' here
referring to nothing more than the top level scope of the current namespace...
i.e., the file), this is a necessary step since, as the program's entry point,
<code>main</code> would <em>have</em> to be accessible from outside the immediate scope.</p>
<p><code>fn</code> is the function keyword.</p>
<p><code>main()</code> is the name of the function (and where the argument list <em>would</em> be)
and <code>!void</code> is the return type. Looking a little closer at that return type:</p>
<p>In C, the return type of a function is declared <em>before</em> anything else. This
makes a certain amount of sense: it's congruent with how variables are
declared, after all, and scanning the file you can see clearly "calling this
will get you that."</p>
<p>In Zig, the return type comes after the function declaration but before the
function body. This also makes sense! It's the same in Rust and Go, and seems
to be generally a more modern approach. The reason is actually pretty simple:
doing it this way makes it possible to have a context-free grammar! C and C++
put the parser in a position where it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">has to understand semantics to even just
<em>parse</em> the source
code.</a></p>
<p>In Zig, <code>main</code> returns <code>void</code> (well, actually, it can return a variety of
things, and if it returns void (which is just a way of saying it doesn't return
anything at all)), it's actually returning
<a href="https://github.com/jfo/zig/blob/7381aaf70e0cad92fc52b79f3aa2a0abb7c3ee04/lib/std/start.zig#L241-L244"><code>0</code></a>
as a success code, but) there is a wrinkle!  <code>void</code> is preceded by an
exclamation mark. This means: "This function is supposed to return <code>void</code>, but
it <em>could</em> fail and return an error." This is an <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Inferred-Error-Sets">inferred error
set</a>, and
whenever a function that <em>could</em> fail is called, the compiler will enforce that
you handle that error at the call site. More on Zig's error handling some other
time, for now it is enough to understand what the <code>!</code> in front of the return
type declaration means. I want to move on to the body of the function, let's go
line by line.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
</code></pre>
<p>So, we can see that this is a call into a standard library function (<code>std</code>)
that returns something that we assign to <code>const stdout</code>. Standard out (stdout) and
standard error (stderr) may be familiar concepts from the shell, but what does it
mean to be referring to <code>stdout</code> here in this program? What exactly <em>is</em>
<code>stdout</code>? Whatever it is, it's being returned by the call to <code>outStream()</code>,
which is a method called on the return value of <code>std.io.getStdOut()</code>, so we
first need to know what <em>that</em> is.</p>
<p>To the source! In the Zig source tree, <code>std</code> lives in <code>lib/std/std.zig</code>, which
is a file that makes a wide variety of functionality available. It includes the line:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> io = <span>@import</span>(<span>"io.zig"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Which is referred to on the <code>std</code> variable as <code>std.io</code> (again, notice the <code>pub</code>
keyword, without which this declared constant would be inaccesible outside of
this immediate scope). Going deeper, into <code>lib/std/io.zig</code>...</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>getStdOut</span></span>() File {
    <span>return</span> File{
        .handle = getStdOutHandle(),
        .capable_io_mode = .blocking,
        .intended_io_mode = default_mode,
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>stdout</code> is a <em>File</em> struct. Let's look at that. It is imported at the top
of <code>io.zig</code> as</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> File = std.fs.File;
</code></pre>
<p>and lives in the source, perhaps unsurprisingly, at <code>lib/std/fs/File.zig</code>. This
struct definition is quite long, so I'll focus on what we want to look at, the
<code>outStream()</code> method.</p>
<h2>An aside: methods vs functions</h2>
<p>Zig doesn't <em>really</em> have methods, but it's useful to talk about a special
class of functions <em>as</em> methods, since the calling convention supports implicit
passing of <code>self</code> when called on a struct "instance" using dot syntax. Let me
show you what I mean.</p>

    <article>

<p>Aug 15, 2020</p>
<p>This is a hand-wavy philosophical article about programming, without quantifiable justification, but with some actionable advice and a case study.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are two types in the program, <code>Blorb</code> and <code>Gonk</code>.
Suppose also that they both can <code>blag</code>.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to add the following trait?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>trait</span> <span>Blag</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>blag</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I claim that it makes sense only if you have a function like</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>fn</span> <span>blagyify</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Blag</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, if some part of you program is generic over <code>T: Blag</code>.</p>
<p>If in every <code>x.blag()</code> the <code>x</code> is either <code>Blorg</code>, or <code>Gonk</code>, but never a <code>T</code> (each usage is <em>concrete</em>), you don’t need this abstraction.
“Need” is used in a literal sense here: replace a trait with two inherent methods named <code>blag</code>, and the code will be essentially the same.
Using a trait here doesn’t achieve any <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015">semantic compression</a>.</p>
<p>Given that abstractions have costs “don’t need” can be strengthen to “probably shouldn’t”.</p>

<p>Not going for an abstraction often allows a for more specific interface.
A monad in Haskell is a thing with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>.
Which isn’t telling much.
Languages like Rust and OCaml can’t express a general monad, but they still have concrete monads.
The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is called <code>and_then</code> for futures and <code>flat_map</code> for lists.
These names are <em>more specific</em> than <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> and are easier to understand.
The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is only required if you want to write code generic over type of monad itself, which happens rarely.</p>
<p>Another example of abstraction which is used mostly concretely are collection hierarchies.
In Java or Scala, there’s a whole type hierarchy for things which can hold other things.
Rust’s type system can’t express <code>Collection</code> trait, so we have to get by with using <code>Vec</code>, <code>HashSet</code> and <code>BTreeSet</code> directly.
And it isn’t actually a problem in practice.
Turns out, writing code which is generic over collections (and not just over iterators) is not that useful.
The "but I can change the collection type later" argument also seems overrated — often, there’s only single collection type that makes sense.
Moreover, swapping <code>HashSet</code> for <code>BTreeSet</code> is mostly just a change at the definition site, as the two happen to have almost identical interface anyway.
The only case where I miss Java collections is when I return <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, but mean a generic <em>unordered</em> collection.
In Java, the difference is captured by <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> vs <code>Collection&lt;T&gt;</code>.
In Rust, there’s nothing built-in for this.
It is possible to define a <code>VecSet&lt;T&gt;(Vec&lt;T&gt;)</code>, but doesn’t seem worth the effort.</p>
<p>Collections also suffer from <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> problem — collapsing similar synonyms under a single name.
Java’s
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html">Queue</a>
has <code>add</code>, <code>offer</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>poll</code> methods, because it needs to be a collection, but also is a special kind of collection.
In C++, you have to spell <code>push_back</code> for <code>vector</code>'s push operation, so that it duck-types with <code>deque</code>'s <code>front</code> and <code>back</code>.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>Collection hierarchy is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for mixing up method names.
Rust’s <code>BinaryHeap</code> should have had <code>BinaryHeap::pop_max</code> method.
Alas, we are stuck with <code>pop</code>, which, coupled with the fact that the heap is surprisingly and uselessly a max-heap, means many student-hours wasted on debugging misbehaving Dijkstra algorithm.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Finally, the promised case study!
rust-analyzer needs to convert a bunch of internal type to types suitable for converting them into JSON message of the Language Server Protocol.
<code>ra::Completion</code> is converted into <code>lsp::Completion</code>; <code>ra::Completion</code> contains <code>ra::TextRange</code> which is converted to <code>lsp::Range</code>, etc.</p>
<p>The first implementation started with an abstraction for conversion:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Conv</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>conv</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This abstraction doesn’t work for all cases — sometimes the conversion requires additional context.
For example, to convert a rust-analyzer’s offset (a position of byte in the file) to an LSP position (<code>(line, column)</code> pair), a table with positions of newlines is needed.
This is easy to handle:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>ConvWith</span><span>&lt;</span><span>CTX</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>Output</span><span>;</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>conv_with</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>CTX</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span><span>::</span><span>Output</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Naturally, there was an intricate web of delegating impls.
The typical one looked like this:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
</pre></td><td><pre><span>impl</span> <span>ConvWith</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>TextRange</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>Output</span> <span>=</span> <span>Range</span><span>;</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>conv_with</span><span>(</span>
        <span>self</span><span>,</span>
        <span>line_index</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Range</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Range</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.start</span><span>()</span><span>.conv_with</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>),</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.end</span><span>()</span><span>.conv_with</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>),</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>There were a couple of genuinely generic impls for converting iterators of convertible things.</p>
<p>The code was hard to understand.
It also was hard to use: if calling <code>.conv</code> didn’t work immediately, it took a lot of time to find which specific impl didn’t apply.
Finally, there were many accidental (as in “accidental complexity”) changes to the shape of code: <code>CTX</code> being passed by value or by reference, switching between generic parameters and associated types, etc.</p>
<p>I was really annoyed by how this conceptually simple pure boilerplate operation got expressed as clever and fancy abstraction.
Crucially, almost all of the usages of the abstraction (besides those couple of iterator impls) were concrete.
So I replaced the whole edifice with much simpler code, a bunch of functions:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
15
</pre></td><td><pre><span>fn</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span>
    <span>line_index</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>,</span>
    <span>range</span><span>:</span> <span>TextRange</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Range</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>position</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>.start</span><span>());</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>end</span> <span>=</span> <span>position</span><span>(</span><span>line_index</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>.end</span><span>());</span>
    <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Range</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>start</span><span>,</span> <span>end</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>position</span><span>(</span>
    <span>line_index</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>LineIndex</span><span>,</span>
    <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>TextSize</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>lsp_types</span><span>::</span><span>Position</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Simplicity and ease of use went up tremendously.
Now instead of typing <code>x.conv()</code> and trying to figure out why an impl I think should apply doesn’t apply, I just auto-complete <code>to_proto::range</code> and let the compiler tell me exactly which types don’t line up.</p>
<p>I’ve lost fancy iterator impls, but the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/4418/commits/1586bab0b97bef411e6187dfc389557edbc5a16e">total diff</a>
for the commit was <code>+999,-1123</code>.
There was some genuine code re-use in those impls, but it was not justified by the overall compression, even disregarding additional complexity tax.</p>
<p>To sum up, “is this abstraction used exclusively concretely?” is a meaningful question about the overall shape of code.
If the answer is “Yes!”, then the abstraction can be replaced by a number of equivalent non-abstract implementations.
As the latter tend to be simpler, shorter, and more direct, “Concrete Abstraction” can be considered a code smell.
As usual though, any abstract programming advice can be applied only in a concrete context — don’t blindly replace abstractions with concretions, check if provided justifications work for your particular case!</p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Four graphs show that almost all of Mozilla’s revenue comes
from Google et al., and the majority of its expenses go to software
development.</em></p>

<p>In my <a href="https://civilityandtruth.com/2020/08/13/mozillas-uncertain-future/">last post about Mozilla</a> I included a bit of data and a
lot of opinions. In this post I’ll reverse that and provide more data
and fewer opinions.</p>

<p>I was interested in knowing at a high level what were the major
categories of Mozilla’s revenue and (what’s a bit more interesting)
what were the major categories of Mozilla’s expenses. To do this I
went through the consolidated financial statements for the Mozilla
Foundation and Mozilla Corporation, extracted the data I was
interested in, and applied a bit of R code.</p>

<p>The graph above shows the major categories of revenue for Mozilla from
2005 through 2018, the last year for which we have financial
data. Note that I consolidated some categories of revenue to simplify
the graph. For example, I combined income from interest and dividends,
investment gains and losses, and similar categories into an overall
category of miscellaneous revenue.</p>

<p>The results are not surprising: by far the major driver of revenue was
royalties received from Google and other search engine vendors, with
everything else (including grants and donations to the Mozilla
Foundation) being relatively negligible.</p>

<figure>
  <p><a href="https://civilityandtruth.com/assets/images/mozilla-revenue-categories-pct.png"><img src="https://civilityandtruth.com/assets/images/mozilla-revenue-categories-pct-embed.png" alt="Graph of Mozilla’s main categories of revenue as percentages of total revenue"></a></p>

</figure>

<p>The data for the various high-level categories is bit more interesting
when expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Again, royalties from
Google and other search engine providers dominate the picture, never
going below 90% of total revenue and typically at 95% or greater.</p>

<p>There’s one interesting anomaly for the years prior to 2009, in which
miscellaneous income rose to almost 10% of total revenue and then
dropped below zero (i.e., it constituted a net loss). This appears to
be due to Mozilla Foundation and/or Corporation investments doing well
in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, and then suffering
losses. Since 2009 miscellaneous income has been more stable as a
percentage of total revenue, possibly due to the favorable economic
environment and/or more conservative investment strategies.</p>

<p>Also, for future reference note the category relating to subscriptions
and advertising, which is currently under 5% of total revenues. I
presume that revenues relating to Pocket are assigned to that
category, and that revenues from the Mozilla VPN and other services
will go there as well. It will be interesting to see in future
financial statements whether that category grows substantially as a
percentage of total revenue. That will be a key indicator of whether
Mozilla is going to be able to move beyond its dependence on Google and
other search engine providers.</p>

  <p><a href="https://civilityandtruth.com/assets/images/mozilla-expense-categories.png"><img src="https://civilityandtruth.com/assets/images/mozilla-expense-categories-embed.png" alt="Graph of Mozilla’s main categories of expenses"></a></p>

</figure>

<p>The graph above shows the main categories of expenses incurred by the
Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation considered together. As one
might expect, the largest category of expenses is for activities
related to software development, including the salaries of the
software developers themselves.</p>

<p>The next two largest categories are marketing, i.e., activities
relating to promotion of Mozilla products and services, and general
and administrative, i.e., all the support activities needed to keep
Mozilla running, including the salaries of people not involved in
software development. It’s interesting to note that marketing-related
expenses seem to have leveled off somewhat in the years leading up to
2018.</p>

<p>The programs category includes things other than software development
that further the nonprofit goals of Mozilla. Mozilla Foundation grants
and fellowships go here, among others.</p>

<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative
Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The final graph shows the data in the previous graph expressed as a
percentage of total expenses. Here again we see the large amount of
expenses relating to software development, just above 60% in the years
leading up to 2018.</p>

<p>Marketing and general and administrative expenses have tended to be in
the range of 10% to 20%, with marketing sometimes higher than G&amp;A
and sometimes lower. Finally, program-related expenses have been
rising in the years leading up to 2018, and if this trend continues in
2019 and beyond may come to make up around 10% of total Mozilla
spending.</p>

<p>That concludes this brief tour of Mozilla’s finances. There is more
that could be said about Mozilla’s finances, but that’s a task I will
leave to others; see the section below for how to get started.</p>

<p>Finally, thanks to all who read my prior post and tweeted about it,
and to those who ended up following me on Twitter or subscribing to my
(very occasional) newsletter. If you’re interested in more of my
thoughts on Mozilla I will likely end up disappointing you: this will
probably be my final Mozilla-related post for a while, and perhaps
forever. Feel free to unfollow me or unsubscribe unless you have an
interest in whatever other topics I might end up writing about next.</p>

<p>A lot of my Google searches are specific and require lots of typing, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>site:cppreference.com OR site:cplusplus.com realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This searches for "realloc" on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference.com</a> and <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a>.
To reduce the amount of typing, I built a command line tool that allows me to
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)">macros</a> that expand into larger phrases. E.g. I can write</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{cpp} realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instead of writing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>site:cppreference.com OR site:cplusplus.com realloc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could copy-and-paste these URLs into my browser. But, since I use macOS, I
create a <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Functions">shell function</a> that uses the <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/open.html">open</a> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ gg() { open "$(./search-google "$@")" ; }
$ gg {movie} alien 1979
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>(Opens URL in my browser.)
</code></pre>

<p>I place the macro file in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory">home directory</a> using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.home">pathlib.Path.home</a>.</p>
<p>I read from the macro file using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.read_text">pathlib.Path.read_text</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.finditer">re.finditer</a>.
I use a regular expression to extract the macros from the macro file, and I use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip">str.strip</a> to remove excess whitespace from the macros.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format_map">str.format_map</a> to perform the macro substitutions.</p>
<p>Instead of performing substitutions until I hit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)">fixed point</a>, I perform a
finite number of substitutions.
(This is the constant <code>MAX_MACRO_SUBSTITIONS</code>.)
I do this because it is an easy way to prevent unbounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>, and, in
practice, my macros are not complex enough to cause this strategy to fail.</p>
<p>A macro substitution will fail if I reference a macro that doesn't exist, e.g.
<code>{xyxhkj}</code>.
I handle this by using the context manager <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress">contextlib.suppress</a>.
This allows me to catch the relevant exception and stop performing
substitutions, without terminating the whole program.</p>
<p>I build the URL by combining a constant prefix,
<code>https://www.google.com/search?q=</code>, with the query string.
I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.quote_plus">urllib.parse.quote_plus</a> to properly escape the query string. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>import urllib.parse
query = "site:news.ycombinator.com haskell"
print(query)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>site:news.ycombinator.com haskell
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print(urllib.parse.quote_plus(query))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>site%3Anews.ycombinator.com+haskell
</code></pre>

<p>In this week's post, you learned how to build a command line tool that helps
you search Google.
You learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">pathlib</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re</a> modules to parse the macros.
And you used the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html">urllib.parse</a> module to properly construct the URL.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read about the different Google search operators. (<a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">"Refine web searches" via
google.com</a>.)</p>
<p>Create a few macros that would be useful to you. Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a macro that restricts searches to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby-lang.org</a>.</li>
<li>Create a macro that searches for upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run">5K races</a> in a specified city.</li>
<li>CreateÂ&nbsp;a macro that searches a person's name, but excludes results from
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</li>
</ul>

Erdős, who is well-known for his contributions to number theory, set theory, probability theory, graph theory, and more, as well as the invention of the Erdős Number, a measure of one's proximity to having collaborated with him, is of course a subject himself. That said, in Hoffman's biography of him, there is a bit about the behavior of mathematicians and a lone physicist that does well to embody the spiritual and cognitive differences between the two groups, both of which share a passion for mathematical thinking but nevertheless are separable beasts.&nbsp;</p><p><span></span>The excerpt of interest tells of a mathematics conference in which a group of mathematicians return to the coffee table after a talk only to find a puzzle.</p><p><a name="more"></a><i>The rest filed out and raced toward a folding table that supported two large brown plastic tanks, one labeled WITH CAFFEINE, the other WITHOUT CAFFEINE. The mathematicians had already tanked up once, before the graph theo- rist's talk, and now the labels on the tanks were curiously switched. The mathematicians were in a tizzy and stared, puzzled, at the tanks. Their collective brainpower, fine for discerning the latest wrinkles in infinite graph theory, was stalling out on the case of the true Joe.</i></p><p><i>Finally a lightbulb went off in the head of a jovial, beer-bellied fellow in a JOY OF SETS T-shirt. He stepped forward and filled his Styrofoam cup, half from one tank and half from the other.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>"I see," laughed one of his compatriots, "the game-theoretic solution!"</i></p><p><i>"I have another solution," said a thin man whose hands trembled slightly, apparently from a caffeine high. He&nbsp;</i><i>filled his cup a quarter full from one of the tanks.&nbsp;</i><i>"This is the asymptotic solution," he announced. "I'm already so wired I only want a little bit more; whatever is in the cup, I win."</i></p><p><i>A bystander who was a physicist rather than a mathematician didn't understand the need for all this sophisticated thinking. He pointed out that one tank was bigger than the other, and that the bigger tank presumably held caffeinated coffee since more people drink it than drink decaf. &nbsp;The mathematicians were taken aback by the simplicity of the solution. "Our different approaches," said the physicist, "remind me of an old joke. A physicist and a mathematician are flying cross-country together. Each is keeping a diary of the trip. They fly over a white horse in Iowa. The physicist writes, 'There is a white horse in Iowa.' The mathematician writes, 'There exists, somewhere in the Midwest, a horse, white on top.'"</i></p><p>For all that has been written about the difference between physicists and mathematicians, especially with the goal of illuminating their inner minds, this passage provides both a reasonable illustration and a good laugh.</p><p><b><a href="http://twitter.com/philliplevin"> Did you enjoy this?

August 15, 2020 | https://aboutsnack.com/blog/why-remote-work-is-bad | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aboutsnack.com/blog/why-remote-work-is-bad">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Tips for when the novelty of remote working wears off</span></p></div><div><p>Many of us have unexpectedly found ourselves remote working this year. At first, it seemed like a dream - no more commute! No more tedious office politics! An extra hour in bed in the morning! But now that we've all been working away in our spare rooms and on our sofas for weeks on end the novelty is beginning to wear off.</p>
<p>Here are some of the downsides to remote working, and tips for how to overcome them…</p>
<h2>It's impossible to focus</h2>
<p>When you're working in isolation it can be really hard to keep your mind from wandering. Whether it's taking a minute to load the dishwasher, feed the cat or plan your weekend it's all too easy for those five minute breaks to become half an hour of mindless scrolling on TikTok.</p>
<p>It's a fine balance between keeping on task, and allowing your mind a bit of breathing room - after all in the buzz and noise of an office you'd likely face micro distractions all day.</p>
<p>A great way to keep yourself motivated, productive and focussed is to try the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pomodoro Method</a>. It's a scientifically proven technique where you knuckle down and work in 25 minute bursts, followed by timed five minute breaks to refresh your mind. There are great <a href="https://tomato-timer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pomodoro apps</a> available so that you can time it on your phone, or even on your <a href="https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/fa42ebf3-10ec-4b0e-8dbb-2e36d4020f0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fitbit</a>!</p>
<h2>It can be lonely</h2>
<p>If you're used to going into an office every day it's a big adjustment to miss out on the team culture. All those water cooler moments, team meetings and coffee breaks really help to top up your mind's need for social interaction. You might have found Greg from accounts seriously annoying with his constant holiday stories, but now that you don't speak to him (or anybody else) for hours on end you strangely find yourself wondering if he ever got to go to Cancun?</p>
<p>Teams using Slack can help their members to keep social interaction going by using tools such as <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Snack</a>, which enables spontaneous video chats between colleagues, with ice breaker questions and timers to keep it fun and brief.</p>
<h2>Work/life balance becomes a blur</h2>
<p>You've always wanted more 'life' in your work/life balance, but now that work is in your home, and you only have to walk a few steps from your bed to your desk, it all seems a bit too close for comfort.</p>
<p>The ideal situation is of course to have a home office that you can close the door on at the end of the day, but if that's not possible, consider solutions such as a Murphy desk that you can close up when you clock off so that your work space isn't staring you in the face as you try to relax.</p>
<h2>Creativity can dry up</h2>
<p>When you are sitting in the same environment day in day out, without the stimulation of your team around you, it can be hard to keep coming up with fresh new ideas. When you find yourself hitting the brick wall, take some time to see what the competition are up to. Also have a look at your customers, see what they're talking about on social media, or how they are adapting to current circumstances. By bringing the outside into your day you can create serendipity by stumbling across something that inspires your next brilliant project. Sometimes you have to get out of your zone and create your own lightbulb moment!</p>
<h2>Unexpected video calls</h2>
<p>There's no getting around this one. Just make sure you at least change out of your pyjamas each day!</p></div></div>]]>
