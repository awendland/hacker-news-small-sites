    <p><strong><em>This is the third part of the “Rebuilding the spellchecker” series, dedicated to the explanation of how the world’s most popular spellchecker Hunspell works.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Quick recap</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html">first part</a></strong>, I’ve described what Hunspell is; and why I decided to rewrite it in Python. It is an <strong>explanatory rewrite</strong> dedicated to uncovering the knowledge behind the Hunspell by “translating” it into a high-level language, with a lot of comments.</li>
  <li>In the <strong><a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">second part</a></strong> I’ve covered the basics of the <strong>lookup</strong> (word correctness check through the dictionary) algorithm, including <em>affix compression</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This part is a carry-over of <strong>lookup algorithm explanation</strong>, dedicated to <strong>word compounding</strong> and some less complicated but nonetheless important concerns: word case and word-breaking. To understand this part, reading <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">the previous one</a> is strongly suggested. At very least you should remember that there are <em>stems</em> with <em>flags</em>, specified by <code>.dic</code>-file, with the meaning of flags defined in <code>.aff</code>-file.</p>

<h2 id="word-compounding">Word compounding</h2>

<p>Many languages, like German, Dutch, or Norvegian, have <em>word compounding</em>: two stems can be joined together, producing the new word. To check the spelling of the word in the language with compounding, the spellchecker needs to break it into all possible parts, and check if there exists a combination of parts such that all parts would be correct words that are allowed inside compound words.</p>

<p>Hunspell has two independent mechanisms to specify the compounding logic of a language in aff-file: <strong>per-stem flags</strong>, and <strong>regexp-like rules</strong>. Sometimes both mechanisms are used in the same dictionary.</p>

<h3 id="per-stem-flag-checks">Per-stem flag checks</h3>

<p>There is a generic <code>COMPOUNDFLAG</code> directive to specify a flag, which, when attached to a stem, means “this stem can be anywhere in a compound” (examples from LibreOffice’s Norvegian dictionary):</p>

<div><div><pre><code># In nb_NO.aff:
...
# Directive defines: any word with "z" flag is allowed to be in a compound
COMPOUNDFLAG z

# In nb_NO.dic:
...
fritt/CEGKVz
...
røyk/AEGKVWz
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both <code>fritt</code> (“free”) and <code>røyk</code> (“smoke”) have <code>z</code> flag, which means they could be in any place in compound word, and thus, “røykfritt” (“smoke-free” = “non-smoking”) is a valid one—and “frittrøyk” too<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There are also more precise <code>COMPOUNDBEGIN</code>/<code>COMPOUNDMIDDLE</code>/<code>COMPOUNDEND</code> directives, setting the flags for stems which can be only at a certain place in compounds. Flags designated by those directives could be freely mixed: a compound can consist of a part marked with generic <code>COMPOUNDFLAG</code>, and another part marked with <code>COMPOUNDEND</code>.</p>

<p>To check the compound word for correctness, Hunspell needs to chop off the beginning of the word, of every possible length, and check if it is a valid stem which is allowed at the beginning of the compound. If so, the algorithm recursively chops the next parts, till the whole word is split into compound parts (or no suitable parts found).</p>

<p>Note that depending on the word’s length, and on how many dictionary words are allowed to be in compounds, the loop can take quite some time: the process we described in the <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-09-spellchecker-2.html">previous part</a> (affix-based search of the correct form) can be repeated dozens of times for various “part candidates”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_lookup.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.lookup.Lookup.compounds_by_flags"><code>Lookup.compound_by_flags</code></a> in Spylls documentation be your guide!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="defining-compounds-as-regexp-like-rules">Defining compounds as regexp-like rules</h3>

<p>There is another way to specify compounding logic. It is implemented by <code>COMPOUNDRULE</code> directive, with statements like <code>A*B?C</code> (meaning, “correct compound consists of any number of words with the flag <code>A</code>, then one or zero words with the flag <code>B</code>, then a mandatory word with the flag <code>C</code>”). The most common use of it is specifying suffixes in numerals. For example, in the <code>en_US</code> dictionary:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># en_US.aff
COMPOUNDRULE 2     # we have 2 compound rules listed below
COMPOUNDRULE n*1t  # rule 1: any number (*) of "n"-marked stems, then "1"-marked stem, then "t"-marked stem
COMPOUNDRULE n*mp  # rule 2: any number (*) of "n"-marked stems, then "m"-marked stem, then "p"-marked stem

# en_US.dic
# ...defines numbers as "stems" for this rule:
0/nm
1/n1
2/nm
3/nm
4/nm
5/nm
6/nm
7/nm
8/nm
9/nm
# ...and numerical suffixes as stems, with different flags, too!
0th/pt
1st/p
1th/tc
2nd/p
2th/tc
3rd/p
3th/tc
4th/pt
5th/pt
6th/pt
7th/pt
8th/pt
9th/pt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This leads to Hunspell being able to say that “1201st” is correct (the rule <code>n*mp</code> matched: “1” and “2” with “n” flags, “0” with “m”, and “1st” with “p”), and “1211th” is correct (another rule in action: <code>n*1t</code>), but “1211st” is not.</p>

<p>Handling the word correctness check in a presence of the <code>COMPOUNDRULE</code> requires to again recursively split word into possible parts—but this time already found parts should be checked for a partial match against known rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_lookup.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.lookup.Lookup.compounds_by_rules">Lookup.compound_by_rules</a> implements this in a complicated, yet concise way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="but-wait-there-is-more">But wait, there is more!</h3>

<p><del>To make things more complicated</del> To match the complexity of real life, both algorithms of compound words checking need to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Numeric <strong>limitations</strong>: some dictionaries might limit the minimum size of a part of the compound, or the maximum number of parts.</li>
  <li><strong>Affixes:</strong> By default, any prefix is allowed at the beginning of the compound word, and any suffix is allowed at the end; and yet, some affixes might have flags saying “it should never be in any compound”, and some others might have flags saying “it is allowed <em>in the middle</em> of the compound” (e.g. prefix to non-first or suffix to a non-last part).</li>
  <li><strong>Several rules</strong> that, being present in aff-file, reject some compound words with seemingly correct parts as incorrect: for example, if the letter at the boundary of the compound is tripled (<code>fall+lucka</code>); if some parts of the compound are repeated (<code>dubb+bon+bon</code>); if the non-first part of the compound is capitalized, or “this regexp-like pattern is prohibited at the boundary of the compound parts”, and so on.</li>
  <li>Some of those settings might lead to a whole <strong>new word checking loop</strong> in the middle of compound checking: for example, <code>CHECKCOMPOUNDREP</code> setting tells the algorithm: use the <code>REP</code>-table specified in aff-file (typical misspelled sequences of letters, like “f=&gt;ph”, usually used on suggest) to check if some part of the compound, with replacement applied, is the valid word. If yes, then it is an incorrect compound! E.g. “badabum” split into parts “ba”, “da”, “bum”, but then, if we apply the replacement “u=&gt;oo”, turns out “daboom” is a correct non-compound word… Then we should consider “badabum” a misspelling, and the “ba daboom” is most probably what was misspelled.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you thrilled? Then follow the <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_lookup.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.lookup.Lookup.compound_forms"><code>Lookup.compound_forms</code></a> docs to uncover even more dirty details.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="and-other-complications">…and other complications</h2>

<p>Affix check and (de)compounding are the main parts of the algorithm, yet there is more! Just a brief overview to give you some taste:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Words case: “kitten” can be spelled “Kitten” or “KITTEN”, but “Paris” can’t be spelled “paris”
    <ul>
      <li>…but, the word might have a flag defined as <code>KEEPCASE</code> in aff-file, meaning it should be ONLY in the exact case as in the dictionary;</li>
      <li>…and there are complications with the German language: “SS” can be downcased as “ss” or “ß” (“sharp s”), and both should be checked through the dictionary, and also, when the word is uppercased, it is allowed to have “ß”: “STRAßE”;</li>
      <li>…and in Turkic languages casing rules for “i” are different: “i=&gt;İ” and “I=&gt;ı”;</li>
      <li>…and the ending part of the compound might have a flag saying “this compound should be titlecased”: in Swedish dictionary, there are special words like “afrika”, which are allowed only at the end of compounds, and require the whole compound to be in titlecase: “Sydafrika” (South Afrika);</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Word breaking: “foo-bar” should be checked as the whole word, and also as two separate words “foo” and “bar”
    <ul>
      <li>…unless aff-file redefines this, by prohibiting word-breaking, or changing by which patterns words should be broken.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some words might be present in the dictionary with a flag defined as <code>FORBIDDENWORD</code>: it is used to disallow words that are logically possible (allowed stem with allowed suffix), but this specific combination is incorrect in the language.</li>
  <li>There might be an <code>ICONV</code> (“input conversions”) directive defined in aff-file, saying which chars convert before the spellchecking: for example, replacement of several kinds of typographic apostrophes with simple <code>'</code> to simplify the dictionary, or unpacking the ligatures (<code>ﬁ</code> → <code>fi</code>).
    <ul>
      <li>But this feature can be used not only for handling fancy typography: for example, the Dutch dictionary uses it for enforcing proper case of “ij”: In Dutch, it is considered a single entity and both letters should always have the same case. It is achieved by <code>ICONV</code>-ing to ligatures: <code>ij</code>→<code>ĳ</code> and <code>IJ</code>→<code>Ĳ</code> (but <code>Ij</code> wouldn’t be converted, and wouldn’t be found in a dictionary, as all dictionary words also contain ligatures).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An <code>IGNORE</code> directive, defined in aff-file, says which characters to drop before spellchecking (in Arabic and Semitic languages, where vowels may be present but should be ignored).</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s mostly the size of it!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To go for the full ride, start reading the Spylls docs from the <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_lookup.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.lookup.Lookup.__call__"><code>Lookup.__call__</code></a> method. You won’t be disappointed!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="lookup-takeout">Lookup: takeout</h2>

<p>To reiterate on everything said above: There are good and useful dictionaries for spellchecking of many languages, freely available in Hunspell’s format, and one might be tempted to reuse them in own code. But the process of going from the not-that-complicated input format to a full reliable spellchecking includes at least:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Reading of aff-files (consisting of multiple directive “types”, with reading logic depending on particular directive) and dic-files (words with flags)—we’ll talk about this interesting task in later installments<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>;</em></li>
  <li>Affix analysis: either on-the-fly (how Hunspell and Spylls do), or once: “unpack” the list of stems with flags into words with affixes;</li>
  <li>Compounding analysis—unless you just want to omit the support for languages with compounding (this apparently <em>can’t</em> be solved with a pre-generated list of “all correct compound words”);</li>
  <li>Handling of complications with word breaking, text case, special characters, and whatnot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of those tasks are …</p></article></div>

<p>The other day, as I was going through some of my old notes, I stumbled upon something I had written about the console, the terminal and the shell on Unix-like operating systems. I have decided to rewrite these notes in order to share them here on my website. So without further ado we will now stroll down memory lane and take a quick look at the origins of the Unix terminal and shell. And I will also give my advice to new users on Linux or BSD regarding the choice of terminal emulator and shell.</p>

<h2 id="the-terminal-and-the-console">The terminal and the console</h2>

<p>Early computers where huge machines that consisted of multiple cabinets, e.g. one cabinet for the CPU, one or more cabinets for tape drives, one cabinet for each disk drive, one cabinet for a punched card reader and one cabinet for a high speed printer. The image below is a Univac 9400 system from 1967 consisting of several cabinets.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/images/univac-9400.jpg" alt="A Univac 9400 Mainframe"><br><span>A Univac 9400 mainframe computer.</span></p>

<p>The "console" was the "control console". In the pictures below is a "UNIVAC 1" control console and a "UNIVAC 2" control console.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/images/univac-1-control-console.png" alt="UNIVAC 1 control console"><br><span>A UNIVAC 1 control console.</span></p>

<p>The word terminal comes from the Latin "terminus", meaning "an end, a limit, boundary line", indicating that it's the terminating end or "terminal" end of a communications process. You will sometimes hear the description "a dumb terminal" when referring to a text-based environment where the computer is <i>just taking input and showing text</i> while the real work happens at the other end, typically in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter">teleprinter</a> or TTY was the first kind of terminal. Rather than a monitor you would have a literal typewriter in front of you. When you typed on it, you would see the text on a piece of paper and that text would be send to the computer. When the computer replied, you would see the typewriter print on the paper. Some models could also be used to create punched tape for data storage (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission.</p>

<p>In the picture below is a Teletype 33 ASR Teleprinter. It was introduced in 1963 as an electro-mechanical teleprinter and it was one of the most popular terminals in the communications industry. The ASR stands for <b>A</b>utomatic <b>S</b>end and <b>R</b>eceive. The ASR 33 had a built-in punched tape reader and tape punch which allowed the user to save programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/images/asr33.jpg" alt="33 ASR Teleprinter"><br><span>A Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinter, usable as a terminal.</span></p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>If you're interested I can highly recommend that you take a look at Charles Baetsen's Hobby Page as he has a wealth of information about the <a href="https://va3ngc.weebly.com/asr-33-documentation.html">Teletype 33 ASR</a> in the form of both user manuals, installations manuals and videos.</p>

<p>In the picture below Ken Thompson (sitting) and Dennis Ritchie (standing) is using a 33 ASR teleprinter connected to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP-11</a>, the picture is from 1972.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/images/thompson-ritchie-pdp-11.png" alt="Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie"></p>

<p>Later, as computers became much smaller, it was possible to integrate multiple components into one single unit, with both a video monitor and a keyboard put together inside it, and the "console" now became more or less synonymous to the "terminal". Both the "console" and the "terminal" now referred to the physical video terminal that had replaced both the teleprinter and the old control console.</p>

<p>The video terminal provides a way for the kernel and other processes to send text output on the monitor to the user, and to receive text input from the user via the keyboard.</p>

<p>The VT100 is a video terminal, introduced in August 1978 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It was one of the first terminals to support ANSI escape codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes for special features like controlling the status lights on the keyboard. This led to rapid uptake of the ANSI standard, becoming the de facto standard for terminal emulators.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/images/dec-vt100.jpg" alt="DEC VT100"><br><span>A DEC VT100</span></p>

<p>The VT220 is an ANSI standard video terminal introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in November 1983. The VT240 added monochrome vector graphics support to the base model, while the VT241 did the same in color. The 200 series replaced the VT100 series. Among its major upgrades was a number of international character sets, as well as the ability to define new character sets, and a much lighter keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/images/dec-vt220.jpg" alt="DEC VT220"><br><span>A DEC VT220</span></p>

<p>Today, in the software world, "console" and "terminal" has become completely synonymous.</p>

<h3 id="the-virtual-terminal">The virtual terminal</h3>

<p>A virtual terminal or virtual console is a program that simulates a physical terminal. For example, both the Linux kernel and BSD kernels support virtual terminals - terminals that are logically separate, but which access the same physical keyboard and monitor.</p>

<p>The virtual terminal gives the impression that several independent terminals are running concurrently. Each virtual terminal can be logged in with a different user and it can run its own shell and have its own font settings. The virtual terminals each use a device <code>/dev/ttyX</code>, and you can switch between them by pressing <code>Alt+FX</code> (where <code>X</code> is equal to the virtual terminal number, beginning with 1).</p>

<h2 id="the-terminal-emulator">The terminal emulator</h2>

<p>Emulation refers to the ability of a computer program to emulate, i.e. imitate, another program or device. A terminal emulator is a computer program that emulates a physical terminal within some other display architecture, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window System</a>.</p>

<p>Many different terminal emulators have been developed that emulate terminals such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT52">VT52</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT220">VT220</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT320">VT320</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_3270">IBM 3270/8/9/E</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_5250">IBM 5250</a>, and many others.</p>

<p>The terminal emulator takes the input you type at the keyboard and convert those to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> characters which it sends to the shell, or to a program running under the shell (more about the shell later). The terminal emulator also takes the stream of output characters from the various programs you run via the shell and displays them on the monitor.</p>

<p>The purpose of the terminal emulator is to allow access to the command line while working in a graphical user interface, such as the X Window System. Since the shell is "expecting" to interface with a human through a terminal, and we don't use a physical terminal while in a graphical environment, we need the terminal emulator.</p>

<p>You can see what terminal types are available on most Linux distributions by running <code>ls /lib/terminfo/*</code> (the path may be different on your system). On OpenBSD it's <code>ls /usr/share/terminfo/*</code></p>

<h4 id="xterm">xterm</h4>

<p><a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a> was originally written as a stand-alone terminal emulator for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAXstation#VAXstation_100">VAXStation 100 </a> (VS100) by Mark Vandevoorde, a student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gettys">Jim Gettys</a>, who worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">DEC's</a> Cambridge Research Laboratory. It became clear that xterm would be more useful as part of X Window System than as a standalone program, so it was retargeted to the X Window System.</p>

<p>The xterm program is the default terminal emulator for the X Window System. It provides DEC VT102/VT220 features and other selected features from higher-level terminals such as VT320, VT420 and VT520. It also provides Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system directly. If the underlying operating system supports terminal resizing (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd), xterm will use the facilities to notify programs running in the window whenever it is resized.</p>

<p>Around 1996 the main line of development shifted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86">XFree86</a> implementation of the X Window System and xterm is now maintained by Thomas Dickey, who is also the current lead developer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29">Lynx</a>, a popular customizable text-based web browser.</p>

<p>Early versions of xterm emulated the VT102 and Tektronix 4014. Later versions added control sequences for DEC and other terminals such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>VT220: Added in patch 24.</li>
    <li>VT320: Added in patch 24.</li>
    <li>VT420: DECSTR (soft terminal reset) was added in patch 34.</li>
    <li>VT520: Although not officially emulated, parts of VT520 features were implemented. Controls DECSMBV and DECSWBV for setting the margin- and warning-bell volume was added in patch 254.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with most X applications, xterm can be customized via global X resources files (e.g. <code>/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm</code>), per-user resource files (e.g. <code>~/.Xresources</code>), or command-line arguments. Most of the command-line options correspond to resource settings, as noted in the <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/xterm/xterm.1.en">xterm manual page</a>.</p>

<p>While the name of the program is xterm, the X resource class in <code>~/.Xresources</code> is <code>XTerm</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre>XTerm*utf8: 1</pre>

<p>The <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/extra/xterm/xterm.1.en">xterm manual page</a> provides a full list of features and options.</p>

<p>xterm is still being actively developed, it works really great across many different systems, it has extremely low input latency, it has many hidden gems and it is my favorite terminal emulator! For that reason I'm going to share some settings you can use in your <code>~/.Xresources</code> file:</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>In a play to convert users of their open source projects into paying customers, today Elastic announced that they are <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">changing the license</a> of both Elasticsearch and Kibana from the open source Apache v2 license to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL). If your organisation uses the open source versions of either Elasticsearch or Kibana in its products or projects, it is now at risk of being forced to release its intellectual property under terms dictated by another.</p>

<p>If you’re not yet aware of the SSPL, you can catch up <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/51230.html">here</a>. As licenses go, it’s pretty problematic from a business perspective. Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">IP lawyer</a> to whom I’ve showed the text of the SSPL has been rather alarmed before they even reach the end of it. Basically, it’s a hostile proprietary license masquerading in open source clothing. By using an SSPL project in your code, you are agreeing that if you provide an online service using that code then you will release not only that code but also the code for every supporting piece of software, all under the SSPL. It’s not a stretch to interpret the wording of the license as requiring users of the SSPL’d software therefore to release the code for everything straight down to the bare metal. There are those who will point to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">the FAQ</a> for the SSPL and claim that the license isn’t interpreted in that way because the FAQ says so. Unfortunately, when you agree to a license you are agreeing to the <em>text of that license document</em> and not to a FAQ. If the text of that license document is ambiguous, then so are your rights and responsibilities under that license. Should your compliance to that license come before a judge, it’s <em>their</em> interpretation of those rights and responsibilities that will hold sway. This ambiguity puts your organisation at risk.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">its announcement</a>, Elastic claims that this is simply a change of open source license. In one way they’re correct: they’re changing the license away from the open source Apache v2 license. However they are changing to what can best be described as a proprietary source available license, <em>not</em> to an open source one. MongoDB, the originators of SSPL, requested that <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI) (the standards body that maintains the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition</a> and certifies licenses as open source) certify the SSPL as such. After a great deal of discussion among the panel of legal, licensing, and open source experts, MongoDB withdrew the SSPL from consideration as an open source license, as it appeared highly unlikely it would be certified as open source. That SSPL is not an open source license is no longer in dispute. That ship has sailed. If you have a problem with this, I suggest you <a href="https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2019-May/020483.html">take it up</a> with OSI. As for Elastic’s public and verifiably false claim that SSPL is an open source license, it’s my hope that OSI will have a conversation with them and make a public statement of their own shortly.</p>

<p>No, this is a business decision, not an ideological one. Elastic made a business decision to change to this hostile proprietary license to give them a way to <del>extort</del>influence users to become customers. Without a great deal more strategic information about Elastic’s business and operations none of us are qualified to judge whether it’s the correct decision, but the decision itself is valid. They are allowed to make this sort of strategic move for their company.</p>

<p>However, you and your organisation have now also been forced into a business decision. If your organisation uses the Apache v2 licensed Elasticsearch or Kibana in its projects or products, it must now assume that it is at risk one way or another. It can upgrade to version 7.11 of these projects, thereby accepting the terms of SSPL and potentially also being required to release the code for its entire stack (a great deal of which it will not have the copyright over and will be unable to release, thereby potentially being in violation of SSPL). It can remain on version 7.10, but then it will no longer receive future updates, including important security fixes, thereby taking on another sort of risk. It could choose to pay for a Gold+ license for the software, but it’s unlikely that the budget is prepared for this sort of unexpected expense. And finally it can rearchitect its project or product, replacing Elasticsearch and/or Kibana with alternatives. Frankly, considering today’s unfriendly move by Elastic, putting some space between it and your organisation may be the safest alternative in the long run, but it will come with its own considerable price tag in time and other potential opportunity and switching costs.</p>

<p>The one thing your organisation cannot afford to do is ignore this. It’s time to call a meeting with your legal, software development, product, finance, and strategy teams to start to figure out the best option for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <section> <p> <img src="http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2021-01-13/2021-01-13-macos9.png" alt="Mac OS 9 in QEMU"></p> <p>QEMU is an open-source emulator for virtualizing computers. Unlike VMWare, it's able to both virtualize CPUs and emulate various CPU instruction sets. It's pretty powerful, free, and has a macOS port. There are alternate versions and different ways to install it. Still, in this example, I'm using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, a package manager for macOS/OSX that allows you to install software via the CLI and manage easily. </p> <p>Now, this post wouldn't be very exciting if I tried this on my Mac Pro, but I decided to try it on my MacBook M1. Thus far, the community has succeeded in getting QEMU to install the ARM version Windows, so I decided to do the more silly path and get PPC and X86 working on Apple Silicon. I encountered very little resistance, which surprised me as I haven't seen/read anyone trying this route. It's surprsingly very usable but the usefulness is going to be limited. I was able to play Sim City 2000 on Mac OS 9.2 at a fairly high resolution. For the sake of brevity, I'm going to skip over installing Homebrew on an Apple M1, but you'll want to use the arch -x86_64 method, which requires prepending. I've gotten OS 10.0 and nearly gotten Windows 10 working on my M1.</p> <p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeSx4pm4MwY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p>  <p>Included below is the instruction for both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.</p> <hr> <br> <h3>Requirements</h3> <ul> <li>Basic understanding of the terminal in OS X/macOS</li> <li>Apple Silicon (M1) computer (or Intel) Mac</li> <li>Xcode</li> <li>xcode-select (CLI Tools) <code>xcode-select --install</code></li> <li>Homebrew</li> </ul> <p> <img src="http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2021-01-13/2021-01-13-osx.jpg" alt="Mac OS X in QEMU"></p> <h3>Step 1: Install QEMU</h3> <p>This is the only step where Apple Silicon and Intel Macs differ. You'll need to install the x86 version of QEMU for the Apple silicon macs first.</p> <h4>Apple Silicon</h4> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">    <span>arch</span> <span>-x86_64</span> brew <span>install </span>qemu </code></pre></figure> <h4>x86 Intel Macs</h4> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">    brew <span>install </span>qemu </code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 2: Create a disk image</h3> <p>The rest of the steps do not need any specification for M1 vs. Intel.</p> <p>You can specify a route, but I just used the default pathing, the 2G = 2 GB below. You can get away with much less for OS X OS 9. If you'd like more space, change the size of the simulated HDD. .</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">    qemu-img create <span>-f</span> qcow2 myimage.img 2G </code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 3: Launching the emulated computer and the tricky part: Formatting the HDD</h3> <p>Now that we have a blank hard disk image, we're ready to go.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> d <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk/image  </code></pre></figure> <p>Let's break this down so it's not just magic. The first command is the qemu core emulator, you can use things like 64-bit x86 CPU <code>qemu-system-x86_64 </code> or a 32-bit CPU <code>qemu-system-i386 </code>, but we're using a PPC, so we are using <code>qemu-system-ppc</code>. </p> <p>Next, we're declaring PC bios with <code>-L pc-bios</code>, I'm unsure if this is necessary. This seems to be the default even in Mac QEMU. After that, the <code>-boot</code> flag declares the boot drive. For those who remember the days of yore, C is the default drive for PCs, D is the default for the CD-Rom like a PC. It's weird, I know. <code>-M</code> is the model flag. It's pretty esoteric, but <a href="http://people.redhat.com/pbonzini/qemu-test-doc/_build/html/topics/PowerPC-System-emulator.html">QEMU uses OpenBIOS</a>, and mac99 is the model for Beige G3s. The lowercase <code>-m</code> is memory, expressed in megabytes, but you can use 1G or 2G for 1 or 2 gigabytes like the format utility. <code>-hda</code> is the image we're using. Finally, <code>-cdrom</code> is the installer image</p> <h3>Step 3.5: Special considerations between operating systems</h3> <p>I discovered that OS X 10.0's installer has a significant flaw: It doesn't have a disk utility. The disk images are black disks thus have no file system. If you want to run OS X 10.0, you'll need to first launch an installer that can format HFS like OS 9 or later versions of OS X, run the disk utility, format the image and then exit out of the emulator. The process would look like this:</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> d <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk/macosx10.4 or macOS9  </code></pre></figure> <p>Then format the drive from the utility, quit the emulator (control-c on the terminal window).</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> d <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk/macosx10.0</code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 4: after the installer fininshes</h3> <p>You will end up seeing a failed boot screen after the installer finishes. This is normal. Either quit the QEMU instance or use control-c in the terminal to close it. Now that it's installed, we want to boot off the internal drive.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> c <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img    </code></pre></figure> <p>MacOS 9 seems to do slightly better when adding the via=pmu and specifying the graphics.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> c  <span>-M</span> mac99,via<span>=</span>pmu  <span>-g</span> 1024x768x32  <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> os9.img  </code></pre></figure> <h3>Step 5: mounting disk images</h3> <p>There's not a lot to do with an OS without software. You can mount plenty of disk image formats</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-ppc <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> c <span>-M</span> mac99 <span>-m</span> 512 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img  <span>-cdrom</span> path/to/disk</code></pre></figure> <p> <img src="http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2021-01-13/2021-01-13-simcity.jpg" alt="Sim City 2000 in QEMU on Apple Silicon"></p> <h3>Bonus round: Trying for x86 64 Windows 10</h3> <p> <img src="http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2021-01-13/2021-01-13-proof.jpg" alt="Windows in QEMU on Apple Silicon"></p> <h3>Step 6: Multi CD-Rom Installs or swapping Disk Images</h3> <p>Older applications and OS installers require mutliple disk images. This can be done from via the CLI inside QEMU.</p> <p>On the QEMU window press:</p> <ul> <li>Control-Alt-2 to bring up the console</li> <li><code>change ide1-cd0 /path/to/image</code></li> <li>Control-Alt-1 to bring back the GUI</li> </ul> <p>Thus far my Windows 10 experiment has been a lot less successful, I've gotten through the installer (it's unbearably slow) but it seems to hand on booting. It looks very feasible. I might have better luck using the 32 bit verison of windows.</p> <p> <img src="http://blog.greggant.com/images/posts/2021-01-13/2021-01-12-windows10.png" alt="Windows in QEMU on Apple Silicon"></p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">qemu-system-x86_64  <span>-L</span> pc-bios <span>-boot</span> d <span>-m</span> 2048 <span>-hda</span> myimage.img <span>-cdrom</span>  Win10_20H2_v2_English_x64.iso  </code></pre></figure> </section> </div> </div></div>]]>

    <p>We crave validation, all the time. It never stops.</p>
<p>We crave validation from ourselves, other humans, even our pets, and our environment.</p>
<p>This craving for validation starts from a young age. We learn to seek it. Constantly. At Home. At School. At the workplace.</p>
<p>We seek it from our Parents. Our siblings. Our Friends. Our Boss, Our Co-workers. Strangers on the internet.</p>
<p>This need for validation is an endless loop. The more we get it, the more we crave it.  It’s hacking our brains. And it has received a massive boost from online social networks.</p>
<p>We post a tweet, and start staring at the Notifications, waiting for that blue dot to appear. </p>
<p>Every time it’s delayed by seconds, we feel a little bit sad at not getting that fix right away. </p>
<p>Time it shows up, we feel validated for posting that tasty morsel of a sentence.</p>
<p>We feel heartbroken that not enough people have upvoted our product on Product Hunt</p>
<p>Why didn’t enough people vote on my Hacker News Post?(I launched a whole product around this need.)</p>
<p>We envy the Reddit Mods(nay Gods) who decide if people can see our post. </p>
<p>Constantly staring at the Follower count.</p>
<p>Mood going up and down along with the trend lines in the graph.</p>
<p>We are hooked.</p>
<p>PS: You can indulge my validation need :-) by following me on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/harishkgarg">Twitter</a> where I share lot of the updates.

</p>
<p>People go funny in the head when talking about politics. The evolutionary reasons for this are so obvious as to be worth belaboring: In the ancestral environment, politics was a matter of life and death. And sex, and wealth, and allies, and reputation… When, today, you get into an argument about whether “we” ought to raise the minimum wage, you’re executing adaptations for an ancestral environment where being on the wrong side of the argument could get you killed. Being on the <em>right</em> side of the argument could let <em>you</em> kill your hated rival!
</p>
<p>If you want to make a point about science, or rationality, then my advice is to not choose a domain from <em>contemporary</em> politics if you can possibly avoid it. If your point is inherently about politics, then talk about Louis XVI during the French Revolution. Politics is an important domain to which we should individually apply our rationality—but it’s a terrible domain in which to <em>learn</em> rationality, or discuss rationality, unless all the discussants are already rational.
</p>
<p>Politics is an extension of war by other means. Arguments are soldiers. Once you know which side you’re on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it’s like stabbing your soldiers in the back—providing aid and comfort to the enemy. People who would be level-headed about evenhandedly weighing all sides of an issue in their professional life as scientists, can suddenly turn into slogan-chanting zombies when there’s a <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/A-Fable-Of-Science-And-Politics">Blue or Green</a> position on an issue.
</p>
<p>In Artificial Intelligence, and particularly in the domain of nonmonotonic reasoning, there’s a standard problem: “All Quakers are pacifists. All Republicans are not pacifists. Nixon is a Quaker and a Republican. Is Nixon a pacifist?”
</p>
<p>What on Earth was the point of choosing this as an example? To rouse the political emotions of the readers and distract them from the main question? To make Republicans feel unwelcome in courses on Artificial Intelligence and discourage them from entering the field? (And no, I am not a Republican. Or a Democrat.)
</p>
<p>Why would anyone pick such a <em>distracting</em> example to illustrate nonmonotonic reasoning? Probably because the author just couldn’t resist getting in a good, solid dig at those hated Greens. It feels so <em>good</em> to get in a hearty punch, y’know, it’s like trying to resist a chocolate cookie.
</p>
<p>As with chocolate cookies, not everything that feels pleasurable is good for you.
</p>
<p>I’m not saying that I think we should be apolitical, or even that we should adopt Wikipedia’s ideal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" rel="nofollow">Neutral Point of View</a>. But try to resist getting in those good, solid digs if you can possibly avoid it. If your topic legitimately relates to attempts to ban evolution in school curricula, then go ahead and talk about it—but don’t blame it explicitly on the whole Republican Party; some of your readers may be Republicans, and they may feel that the problem is a few rogues, not the entire party. As with Wikipedia’s <span>npov</span>, it doesn’t matter whether (you think) the Republican Party really <em>is</em> at fault. It’s just better for the spiritual growth of the community to discuss the issue without invoking color politics.

<p>I founded the curl project early 1998 but had already then been working on the code since <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/01/03/age-is-just-a-number-or-two/" data-type="post" data-id="15434">November 1996</a>. The source code was always open, free and available to the world. The term “open source” actually wasn’t even coined until early 1998,  just weeks before curl was born.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol.png" alt="" width="125" height="108" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol.png 789w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-200x175.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-450x394.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 125px) 100vw, 125px"></figure></div>



<p>In the beginning of course, the first few years or so, this project wasn’t seen or discovered by many and just grew slowly and silently in a dusty corner of the Internet.</p>



<p>Already when I shipped the first versions I wanted the code to be open and freely available. For years I had seen the cool free software put out the in the world by others and I wanted my work to help build this communal treasure trove.</p>



<h2>License</h2>



<p>When I started this journey I didn’t really know what I wanted with curl’s license and exactly what rights and freedoms I wanted to give away and it took a few years and attempts before it landed.</p>



<p>The early versions were <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0">GPL licensed</a>, but as I learned about resistance from proprietary companies and thought about it further, I changed the license to be more commercially friendly and to match my conviction better. I ended up with <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> after a brief experimental time using <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-1.1">MPL</a>. (It was easy to change the license back then because I owned all the copyrights at that point.)</p>



<p>To be exact: we actually have a <a href="https://curl.se/docs/copyright.html">slightly modified MIT license</a> with some very subtle differences. The reason for the changes have been forgotten and we didn’t get those commits logged in the “big transition” to Sourceforge that we did in late 1999…  The end result is that this is now often recognized as “the curl license”, even though it is in effect the MIT license.</p>



<p>The license says everyone can use the code for whatever purpose and nobody is required to ship any source code to anyone, but they cannot claim they wrote it themselves and the license/use of the code should be mentioned in documentation or another relevant location.</p>



<p>As licenses go, this has to be one of the most frictionless ones there is.</p>



<h2>Copyright</h2>



<p>Open source relies on a solid copyright law and the copyright owners of the code are the only ones who can license it away. For a long time I was the sole copyright owner in the project. But as I had decided to stick to the license, I saw no particular downsides with allowing code and contributors (of significant contributions) to retain their copyrights on the parts they brought. To not use that as a fence to make contributions harder.</p>



<p>Today, in early 2021, I count 1441 copyright strings in the curl source code git repository. 94.9% of them have my name.</p>



<p>I never liked how some projects require copyright assignments or license agreements etc to be able to submit code or patches. Partly because of the huge administrative burden it adds to the project, but also for the significant friction and barrier to entry they create for new contributors and the unbalance it creates; some get more rights than others. I’ve always worked on making it easy and smooth for newcomers to start contributing to curl. It doesn’t happen by accident.</p>



<h2>Spare time</h2>



<p>In many ways, running a spare time open source project is easy. You just need a steady income from a “real” job and sufficient spare time, and maybe a server to host stuff on for the online presence.</p>



<p>The challenge is of course to keep developing it, adding things people want, to help users with problems and to address issues timely. Especially if you happen to be lucky and the user amount increases and the project grows in popularity.</p>



<p>I ran curl as a spare time project for decades. Over the years it became more and more common that users who submitted bug reports or asked for help about things were actually doing that during their <em>paid</em> work hours because they used  curl in a commercial surrounding – which sometimes made the situation almost absurd. The ones who actually got paid to work with curl were asking the unpaid developers to help them out.</p>



<p>I changed employers several times. I started my own company and worked as my own boss for a while. I worked for Mozilla on network stuff in Firefox for five years. But curl remained a spare time project because I couldn’t figure out how to turn it into a job without risking the project or my economy.</p>



<h2>Earning a living</h2>



<p>For many years it was a pipe dream for me to be able to work on curl as a real job. But how do I actually take the step from a spare time project to doing it full time? I give away all the code for free, and it is a solid and reliable product.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo.png" alt="" width="186" height="144" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo.png 1011w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-200x155.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-450x348.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wolfssl-logo-768x594.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px"></a></figure></div>



<p>The initial seeds were planted when I met and got to know Larry (wolfSSL CEO) and some of the other good people at <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a> back in the early 2010s. This, because wolfSSL is a company that write open source libraries and offer commercial support for them – proving that it can work as a business model. Larry always told me he thought there was a possibility waiting here for me with curl.</p>



<p>Apart from the business angle, if I would be able to work more on curl it could really benefit the curl project, and then of course indirectly everyone who uses it.</p>



<p>It was still a step to take. When <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/18/im-leaving-mozilla/" data-type="post" data-id="11748">I gave up on Mozilla</a> in 2018, it just took a little thinking before I decided to try it. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/02/02/im-on-team-wolfssl/" data-type="post" data-id="11915">I joined wolfSSL</a> to work on curl full time. A dream came true and finally curl was not just something I did “on the side”. It only took 21 years from first curl release to reach that point…</p>



<p>I’m living the open source dream, working on the project I created myself.</p>



<h2>Food for free code</h2>



<p>We sell commercial support for curl and libcurl. Companies and users that need a helping hand or swift assistance with their problems can get it from us – and with me here I dare to claim that there’s no company anywhere else with the same ability. We can offload engineering teams with their curl issues. Up to 24/7 level!</p>



<p>We also offer custom curl development, debugging help, porting to new platforms and basically any other curl related activity you need. See more on the <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/products/curl/">curl product page</a> on the wolfSSL site.</p>



<p>curl (mostly in the shape of libcurl) runs in <strong>ten billion installations</strong>: some five, six billion mobile phones and tablets – used by several of the most downloaded apps in existence, in virtually every website and Internet server. In a billion computer games, a billion Windows machines, half a billion TVs, half a billion game consoles and in a few hundred million cars… curl has been made to run on 82 operating systems on 22 CPU architectures. Very few software components can claim a wider use.</p>



<p><em>“Isn’t it easier to list companies that are <strong>not</strong> using curl?”</em></p>



<p>Wide use and being recognized does not bring food on the table. curl is also totally free to download, build and use. It is very solid and stable. It performs well, is documented, well tested and “battle hardened”. It “just works” for most users.</p>



<h2>Pay for support!</h2>



<p>How to convince companies that they should get a curl support contract with me?</p>



<p>Paying customers get to influence what I work on next. Not only distant road-mapping but also how to prioritize short term bug-fixes etc. We have a guaranteed response-time.</p>



<p>You get your issues first in line to get fixed. Customers also won’t risk getting their issues added the known bugs document and put in the attic to be forgotten. We can help customers make sure their application use libcurl correctly and in the best possible way.</p>



<p>I try to emphasize that by getting support from us, customers can  take away some of those tasks from their own engineers and because we are  faster and better on curl related issues, that is a pure net gain economically. For all of us.</p>



<p><strong>This is not an easy sell.</strong></p>



<p>Sure, curl is used by thousands of companies everywhere, but most of them do it because it’s free (in all meanings of the word), functional and available. There’s a real challenge in identifying those that actually use it enough and  value the functionality enough that they realize they want to improve their curl foo.</p>



<p>Most of our curl customers purchased support first when they faced a complicated issue or problem they couldn’t fix themselves –  this fact gives me this weird (to the wider curl community) incentive to <em>not</em> fix some problems too fast, because it then makes it work against my ability to gain new customers!</p>



<p>We need paying customers for this to be sustainable. When wolfSSL has a sustainable curl business, I get paid and the work I do in curl benefits all the curl users; paying as well as non-paying.</p>



<h2>Dual license</h2>



<p>There’s clearly business in releasing open source under a strong copyleft license such as GPL, and as long as you keep the copyrights, offer customers to purchase that same code under another more proprietary- friendly  license. The code is still open source and anyone doing totally open things can still use it freely and at no cost.</p>



<p>We’ve shipped <a href="https://curl.se/tiny/">tiny-curl</a> to the world licensed under GPLv3. Tiny-curl is a curl branch with a strong focus on the<em><strong> </strong></em><strong>tiny</strong> part: the idea is to provide a libcurl more suitable for smaller systems, the ones that can’t even run a full Linux but rather use an RTOS.</p>



<p>Consider it a sort of experiment. Are users interested in getting a smaller curl onto their products and are they interested in paying for licensing. So far, tiny-curl supports two separate RTOSes for which we haven’t ported the “normal” curl to.</p>



<h2>Keeping things separate</h2>



<p>Maybe you don’t realize this, but I work hard to keep separate things compartmentalized. I am not curl, curl is not wolfSSL and wolfSSL is not me.  But we  all overlap greatly!</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curl-circles.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/curl-circles.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="562"></a><figcaption>The Daniel + curl + wolfSSL trinity</figcaption></figure>



<p>I work for wolfSSL. I work on curl. wolfSSL offers commercial curl support.</p>



<h2>Reserved features</h2>



<p>One idea that we haven’t explored much yet is the ability to make and offer “reserved features” to paying customers only. This of course as another motivation for companies to become curl support customers.</p>



<p>Such reserved features would still have to be sensible for the curl project …</p></div></div>

<p>So this week I want to talk about how what I know a historian influences how I am interpreting what I am going to call the Capitol Insurrection that happened on Wednesday, January 6 instead of taking the week off as I had originally planned. Since that is a really heavy topic, I am also going to do what I was <em>originally </em>planning to do this week,<strong> which was to share pictures of the two adorable little cats the Pedant-Household has adopted.</strong></p>



<p>They are named Oliver and Percival (Oliver after the knight from <em>The Song of Roland</em> and Percival after the knight from Arthurian legends, particularly Chretien de Troyes), and they are super-friendly and also oppose insurrectionists.</p>

<p>(Note that I have turned off comments for this post.  I know we all have opinions on this, often very strong opinions that others might find very frustrating.  I don’t particularly want to moderate that discussion and in any event, you are, at this point, much better off (if you are in the United States) <a href="https://youtu.be/KXXYkLa-HHI">Contacting Your Representatives</a> with your opinion, rather than arguing on the internet.)</p>



<p>We already talked, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/30/fireside-friday-october-30-2020/">back in October</a>, about civil strife – <em>stasis</em> – in Greek communities and about how I thought that the United States has found itself in the early but accelerating stages of <em>stasis</em> as described by ancient Greek writers (I also worked in some Roman examples, but I really think the Greek parallel is more useful, as the fall of the Roman Republic was so heavily influenced by the involvement of the Roman Army; the United States military has played no such role, nor indicated it is interested in doing so.  For now, the civil-military relationship remains relatively healthy).</p>



<p>I’m going to assume you have all of that already, so if you want to go back and look at how I described <em>stasis</em> and what that meant, you may want to do that first.  Instead, I want to move forward and discuss what thinking in terms of <em>stasis</em> means in understanding the Capitol Insurrection and in particular the relevance of that Greek model of <em>stasis</em> in understanding both what has happened and what may need to happen going forward.  Starting with:</p>



<h2>This Was Serious</h2>



<p>While the insurrection was happening and in its immediate aftermath, there was a tendency to focus on the more frivolous, silly parts of it.  And there were truly silly looking things.  And there are still commentators – some deluded, some acting in bad faith – attempting to insist that this wasn’t serious.  <strong>They are wrong; the Capitol Insurrection was deadly serious</strong> both in the very literal sense that <em>people died</em> (which I think seems to be missed in some quarters), but also for what it means.  And, as time has passed and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/01/14/dc-police-capitol-riot/?arc404=true">more reporting has been done</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/CalebJHull/status/1348334770103660553">what was happening</a>, it has become increasingly apparent that we were perhaps <em>moments </em>away from mass-casualty events (either where politicians were taken by the mob or where the mob so endangered law enforcement or politicians that lethal force was required that would have left many insurrectionists dead).</p>



<p><strong>No ancient Greek would have had any trouble in understanding what happened on the 6th or that it was a serious attempt</strong> (albeit an incompetent one) <strong>to seize power</strong>.  Having a leader or a political faction move with a mob (often armed, but not always so) to<strong> try to disperse the normal civic assemblies of a Greek <em>polis</em> and occupy their normal meeting place was a standard maneuver to try to seize power during <em>stasis</em></strong>. As Dr. <a href="https://twitter.com/Roelkonijn">Roel Konijnendijk</a>, an ancient Greek history specialist, noted in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ks082p/meta_todays_sedition_at_the_united_states_capitol/giexmxe/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">excellent discussion</a> on the r/AskHistorians reddit (where he posts as Iphikrates), “In the Greek world, most attempts to seize power by force tended to take the same form: the seditious party would contrive an opportunity to gather in arms while their opponents were unarmed and off-guard, and seize control of all public spaces.”</p>



<p><strong>To take merely the examples in Athens</strong>, Cylon (the ‘c’ is hard, so Ki-lon – or if you prefer the Greek, Ku-lon – not Psi-lon) attempted it in 632, trying to seize the Athenian Acropolis with an armed mob (Thuc. 1.126; Hdt. 5.71; Plut. <em>Sol.</em> 12.1-2). Cylon’s effort failed in appropriately tragicomic fashion, with his supporters seeking shelter in the temple of Athena and only coming out with a cord that connected them to the altar and its notional protection (the cord breaks and they are all slain, Plut. <em>Sol</em>. 12).  Peisistratos also did it that way in Athens in 561 (Hdt. 1.59) using handpicked bodyguard that he armed with clubs, rather than spears; I cannot help but note just how many things we saw being used as clubs on the 6th. After the Pesistratids were thrown out, Isagoras attempted (with support from the Spartan king Cleomenes I) to institute an oligarchy the same way, seizing the Acropolis, but failing to take the Athenian <em>agora</em>; the Athenians rallied under the democratic leader Cleisthenes and besieged Cleomenes and Isagoras on the Acropolis (Hdt. 5.72; Arist. <em>Ath. Pol</em>. 20.1-4). Later in 411, the ‘Four Hundred’ would seize power in exactly the same way, arriving with a mob of armed supporters to disperse the Athenian <em>boule</em> – it’s council (Thuc. 8.69).  <strong>That’s four examples of this exact tactic from Athens alone</strong> (Athens was by no means the most <em>stasis</em>-prone ancient state, by the way – that was almost certainly Syracuse).</p>



<p>Moreover, <strong>One thing about coup attempts like this in the ancient world: they all look farcical, unless they work.</strong>  Peisistratos’ band of club-armed bodyguards would have looked terribly silly, except that they succeeded, for a time (put a pin in that, we’ll come back to it).  Peisistratos’ second attempt actually built support with something about as farcical as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55606044">Q-Anon Shaman</a>, by riding into Athens on a chariot accompanied by a particularly tall woman dressed as Athena (Hdt. 1.60.2-5); the demonstration was taken by some as a sign of divine support. One assumes many Athenians thought it was laughable (Herodotus certainly does), but it was the precursor to another effort to seize power which also worked, albeit temporarily.</p>



<p>Just because it looks silly doesn’t mean it can’t work.  <strong>This was very serious</strong> and <strong>anyone pretending that ‘censorship’ on Twitter</strong> (a <em>private</em> platform, I thought these folks believed in markets?) <strong>or mean – but true – words from angry politicians is more consequential <em>than the violent attempt to seize the seat of government</em> is either a fool, an enemy, or both</strong> (though I will note that there is a world of difference between ‘fools’ and ‘enemies’ – fools may be persuaded and doing so is essential, see below.  We are all foolish at times; it is the cynics that get my dander up).</p>

<h2>This Is Not Over</h2>



<p>Let’s come back to Peisistratos, because he is instructive here.  Peisistratos tried to make himself tyrant of Athens <em><strong>twice</strong></em> before his third attempt succeeded. We’ve discussed his <strong>first attempt </strong>above (in 561), where Peisistratos attempted to use a club-armed bodyguard to seize the city (Hdt. 1.59); that worked, but he was overthrown in a counter-coup sometime after (Hdt. 1.60.1; this was not immediately though, Herodotus notes that Peisistratos had time to set government affairs, Hdt. 1.59.6).</p>



<p><strong>For the <em>second</em> attempt </strong>in 559, Peisistratos made a key alliance with Megacles – someone we might term an ‘establishment’ figure in the Athenian politics of the day, looking to get the edge on his rivals in the continuing Athenian <em>stasis</em> (Herodotus uses the very word, I should note). He was then brought into the city (the chariot bit above, Hdt. 1.60.2-5) and seized power <em>again</em>, with a mob of his supporters. This effort ends because Peisistratos offends Megacles and once his ally turns on him, he is exiled again (Hdt. 1.61.1-2).</p>



<p>But that wasn’t the end of the matter. Peisistratos, once out of power again used his wealth and support – often foreign support, we are told – to raise an army, hire mercenaries (Argives, Herodotus reports) and rally his supporters before storming back into Athens in 545 (Hdt. 1.16.3-4). Herodotus notes that a great flock of Peisistratos’ partisans from the city swarmed out to support him (this should sound more than a little familiar) and<strong> with that mix of mercenaries and mob he was able to catch the Athenians unprepared</strong> (Hdt. 1.63.1) and scattered them, then used a mix of misinformation (implying he intended no violence, Hdt. 1.63.2) and speed to seize the key parts of the city to keep the Athenians disorganized. And then he murdered or exiled all of his enemies (Hdt. 1.64.3) because that is what tyrants <em>do</em>, whatever they are assuring you about their peaceful intentions ahead of time. People who seize power with violence instead of with votes do not suddenly become pacifists when they win!</p>



<p>I don’t know what form the continuation of the trends that led to the Capitol Insurrection will take, if there will be further attempts at violent disruption in D.C. itself, or if we’ll see a shift to a campaign of domestic terror (something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles">The Troubles</a>, in terms of the violence committed), or if, as with the Nazis after the failure of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a>, the folks who supported this insurrection will focus on trying to use the democratic process to abolish the democratic process.  <strong>But this is not over</strong>.  There is abundant polling evidence that among a minority of Americans (but a plurality or majority of Republicans; we’ll come back to that) support for the lies (that the election was fraudulent, <em><a href="https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/fact-check-debunking-donald-trumps">which it wasn’t</a></em>; the liars were <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20423518-trump_case_decision">given plenty of chances to provide any evidence at all</a> for their lies and they didn’t) remains high.  As in 545, a great many Americans still support Peisistratos.  Some smaller subset of them have bought into messianic conspiracy theories like Q-Anon which fairly transparently could lead to considerable violence. <strong> The underlying conditions that made the tyrannical attempt possible still exist</strong>, so we should expect …</p></div></div>

<article>
  <p>My little <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">donut.c</a> has
 been making the rounds
again, after being featured in a couple YouTube videos (e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEqXNfs_HhY">Lex
Fridman</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW9npZVpiMI">Joma
Tech</a>).  If I had known how much
attention this code would get over the years, I would have spent more time on
it.</p>

<p>One thing that’s always been sort of unfortunate is the heavy use of <code>sin</code> and
<code>cos</code> – both because it necessitates linking the math library (<code>-lm</code>), but
also because it makes it much more CPU-intensive than it really needs to be.
This is especially apparent if you try to port it to an <a href="https://twitter.com/chainq/status/1297178062937825280">older
CPU</a> or an <a href="https://twitter.com/enjoy_digital/status/1341095343816118272">embedded
device</a>.</p>

<p>So, here’s a revised version with no use of <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, and no need for
linking the math library (though this version still does use <code>float</code> types).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>             i,j,k,x,y,o,N;
         main(){float z[1760],a
      #define R(t,x,y) f=x;x-=t*y\
   ;y+=t*f;f=(3-x*x-y*y)/2;x*=f;y*=f;
   =0,e=1,c=1,d=0,f,g,h,G,H,A,t,D;char
 b[1760];for(;;){memset(b,32,1760);g=0,
h=1;memset(z,0,7040);for(j=0;j&lt;90;j++){
G=0,H=1;for(i=0;i&lt;314;i++){A=h+2,D=1/(G*
A*a+g*e+5);t=G*A        *e-g*a;x=40+30*D
*(H*A*d-t*c);y=          12+15*D*(H*A*c+
t*d);o=x+80*y;N          =8*((g*a-G*h*e)
*d-G*h*a-g*e-H*h        *c);if(22&gt;y&amp;&amp;y&gt;

  ?N:0)[".,-~:;=!*#$@"];}R(.02,H,G);}R(
  .07,h,g);}for(k=0;1761&gt;k;k++)putchar
   (k%80?b[k]:10);R(.04,e,a);R(.02,d,
     c);usleep(15000);printf('\n'+(
        " donut.c! \x1b[23A"));}}
          /*no math lib needed

<p>It’s a little misshapen and still has comments at the bottom. I used the first
frame of its output as a template and there’s <em>slightly</em> less code than filled
pixels – oh well. Output is pretty much the same as before:</p>


<pre id="d"></pre>



<p>So, how do we get sines and cosines without using <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code>? Well, the
code doesn’t really <em>need</em> sine and cosine <em>per se</em>; what it actually does is
rotate a point around the origin in two nested loops, and also rotate two
angles just for the animation. If you’ll recall from the other article, the
inner loop is just plotting dots in a circle, which goes around another, larger
circle. In each loop, the sine/cosine terms are just moving by a small, fixed
angle.</p>

<p>So we don’t need to track the <em>angle</em> at all, we only need to start at cos=1,
sin=0 and rotate a circle around the origin to generate all the sines and
cosines we need. We just have to repeatedly apply a fixed rotation matrix:</p>

\[\begin{bmatrix}
c' \\
s'
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta &amp; \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c \\ s \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>So for example, if we were to use an angle of .02 radians in our inner loop, it would look something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>float</span> <span>c</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span>  <span>// c for cos, s for sin</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>314</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>// 314 * .02 ~= 2π</span>
  <span>// (use c, s in code)</span>
  <span>float</span> <span>newc</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9998</span><span>*</span><span>c</span> <span>-</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>01</span><span>9998666</span><span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
  <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>01</span><span>9998666</span><span>*</span><span>c</span> <span>+</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9998</span><span>*</span><span>s</span><span>;</span>
  <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>newc</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>That works, but there’s a problem: no matter how precisely we define our
constants, after repeated iteration of this procedure, the magnitude of our \(\left(c, s\right)\) vector will exponentially grow or shrink over time. If we
only need to make one pass around the loop, maybe we can get away with that,
but if we have to make several (for the rotating animation, we do), we need to
fix that.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/sincos-mag.png" alt="sine and cosine magnitude creep"><br>
<em>an exaggerated illustration of what happens when repeatedly doing low-precision rotations</em></p>

<p>The simplest way to do that would be to multiply \(c\) and \(s\) by \(1/\sqrt{c^2 + s^2}\), but then we’re back to using the math library again. Instead, we can take
advantage of the fact that our magnitude starts out very close to 1, and we’re
going to be iterating this procedure: we can do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton
step</a> after each rotation, and
that will be enough to keep the magnitude “close enough” to 1 over time.</p>

<p>Our goal is to find the reciprocal square root (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">sound
familiar?</a>) of \(a =
c^2 + s^2\), our \(\left(c, s\right)\) vector magnitude.  Say we define a
function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} - a\). The function is 0 when \(x =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\). We can start with an initial guess of 1 for <em>x</em>,
perform a Newton iteration to obtain <em>x’</em>, which will be “closer to”
\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\), the correct value to scale <em>c</em> and <em>s</em> by so that their
magnitude \(c^2 + s^2\) is “close to” 1 again.</p>

<p>A Newton step is defined as \(x' = x - \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}\). I used
<a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a> to do the derivative and simplification and
came up with \(x' = \frac{x\left(3 - a x^2\right)}{2}\). Since we’re only doing
one step, we can plug in our initial guess of 1 for \(x\) and back-substitute
\(c^2 + s^2\) for \(a\) to finally get our adjustment: \(x' = (3 - c^2 - s^2)/2\).</p>



<p>But now that we don’t have to worry so much about the magnitude of our result
(within limits), we can take another shortcut (I got this idea studying old
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a> algorithms).  If we divide out
the cosines from our original rotation matrix, we get</p>

\[\begin{bmatrix}
c' \\
s'
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; -\tan \theta \\
\tan \theta &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c \\ s \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>using the trig identity \(\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}\).
Since we’re only dealing with small angles, the leading \(\frac{1}{\cos
\theta}\) term is close enough to 1 that we can ignore it and have our Newton
step take care of it.</p>

<p>And now we can finally understand how the rotation is done in the code. Towards
the top of the donut code is this #define, which I’ve reindented:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define R(t,x,y) \ 
</span>  <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>x</span> <span>-=</span> <span>t</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>t</span><span>*</span><span>f</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span><span>-</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>-</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>y</span><span>)</span><span>/</span><span>2</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>x</span> <span>*=</span> <span>f</span><span>;</span> \
  <span>y</span> <span>*=</span> <span>f</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This does an in-place rotation of a unit vector <code>x, y</code> where <code>t</code> is \(\tan
\theta\). <code>f</code> is a temporary variable; the first three lines do the “matrix
multiplication” on <code>x, y</code>. <code>f</code> is then re-used to get the magnitude adjustment,
and then finally <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are multiplied by <code>f</code> which moves them back onto
the unit circle.</p>

<p>With that operation in hand, I just replaced all the angles with their sines
and cosines and ran the rotation operator <code>R()</code> instead of calling <code>sin</code>/<code>cos</code>.
The code is otherwise identical.</p>



<p>We can use exactly the same ideas with integer fixed-point arithmetic, and not
use any <code>float</code> math whatsoever. I’ve redone all the math with 10-bit precision
and produced the following C code which runs well on embedded devices which can
do 32-bit multiplications and have ~4k of available RAM:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
</span>
<span>#define R(mul,shift,x,y) \
  _=x; \
  x -= mul*y&gt;&gt;shift; \
  y += mul*_&gt;&gt;shift; \
  _ = 3145728-x*x-y*y&gt;&gt;11; \
  x = x*_&gt;&gt;10; \
  y = y*_&gt;&gt;10;

    <p>The <code>if</code> statement (or <code>if</code> expression) is the cornerstone of every modern programming language - it is so pervasive that we rarely think about how exactly should we use it, or how it is meant to be used. But despite its popularity, <code>if</code> wasnâ€™t always there, and it wasnâ€™t as pervasive as nowadays, so its role is, Iâ€™d argue, still somewhat misunderstood. So in this article, I will examine some mistakes that we can easily avoid in order to improve on our code.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>This is an opinionated text, i.e. it contains my opinions and although I have many arguments that back them, they are ultimately based on <em>my</em> core beliefs about what programming is and should be, so take them as advice, as opposed to a dogma. And here are some of the things on which this advice is based on, structured as postulates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code is for humans (and programmers are humans too).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A form of this appears in a little book known in the hacker community as â€œSICPâ€�, but I donâ€™t know if they were the first to state it. It means that programs are not just instructions for performing a given task - they are text, and as such they should be subject to the same stylistical rules as other text is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code should be as bug-free as possible (and easy to debug as well).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one looks pretty self-explanatory, but the key point is that we have to dedicate effort to make it such, by constantly thinking not only about ways in which the code might go wrong, but also about ways to diagnose potential problems.</p>

<p>I guess I should say something about why I believe these things. Simple - because all other approaches just fail because of the human factor, e.g. any code, that is written without regard for style is bound to become legacy when the person who supports it leaves. Likewise, maintaining code that lacks structure results in bugs (which often can be fixed only by imposing more structure).</p>

<p>Lastly, people often contrast good structure and readability with speed. Firstly, the comparison is a bit unfair, because a well-structured is easier to optimize. And for cases in which it is really the case, in 99% the gain is so little that nobody cares, so the emphasis should remain on readability and structure even then. This is when I would throw this very famous quote by DEK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97 % of the time: pre mature optimization is the root of all evil.
<a href="http://www.kohala.com/start/papers.others/knuth.dec74.html">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that he wrote this when computers were a thousand times slower than today, so we should care about maintainability even more.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, all there was was the assembly language where people didnâ€™t have brackets and had to use <code>jump</code> instructions instead. For those who donâ€™t know what jump does, if you imagine that somewhere in the virtual machine, or the interpreter, that runs your code there is a variable that denotes which line of code should be executed next, then <code>jump</code> is a functionality that basically allows you to set that variable to whatever value you please - it is like a portal that allows you to go to from any place of the program to any other place. For example, a typical <code>if</code> statement that looks like this when written with jumps:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>compare input to waterlevel
if less, jump to A
if equal, jump to B
jump to C

A:
turn motor on
jump to C

B:
turn motor off
C:
...
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40602029/how-to-write-if-else-in-assembly">Source for the assembly pseudocode</a></p>

<p>You can see from this example that, although powerful, jumps are much harder to work with than <code>if</code>-s, although they can sometimes make your code a bit shorter, they will 100% make it less readable which is hardly a good deal - if the important thing is for code to bug free, so youâ€™d always prefer to have a longer and more readable piece of code, than one which is shorter but harder to understand. This realization led to the rise of what was at the time called â€œstructural programmingâ€� paradigm, which was based on the idea that the power of jumps should not be exposed to the programmer - a point which was brought by Edsger W. Dijkstra in the seminal essay <a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a> (<code>goto</code> is the equivalent of a <code>jump</code> instruction statements in non-assembly language context). Simultaneously, the idea of a <em>block</em> (or a â€œcompound statementâ€�) meaning a collection statements that perform a common task (usually denoted today by wrapping them in curly brackets) was pushed forward, and the two ideas gave birth to the <code>if</code> statement that we know today (that <a href="https://craftofcoding.wordpress.com/2017/04/29/the-evolution-of-if-i-from-fortran-i-to-algol-60/">first appeared in the <em>Algol 60</em> programming language</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterlevel) {
  turn motor on
} else if (input equal to waterlevel) {
turn motor off
} else {
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The adoption of structured programming was a long process which began with people even questioning whether structured programs are even capable of encoding all possible computations, but today, although some people are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46586/goto-still-considered-harmful">still defending the use of goto</a>, it (the process) is largely finished - <code>goto</code> is banished and the structured style of programming is so pervasive across modern languages that the term â€œstructuredâ€� is not used any more, simply because there is nothing to contrast it with.</p>

<p>And to reiterate, the reasons for this are quite obvious - using brackets makes our code much more akin to the way we usually talk and write with each other: we often say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œif A then B otherwise Câ€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>we never say things like,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œif A then go to the previous page and start reading from line 12â€�.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I wonder if the programmers who defend the use of <code>goto</code> write and talk like that?)</p>

<p>This already leads me to the first rule that I always follow.</p>



<p>A leftover from the <code>goto</code>-driven style of programming is the possibility of so-called â€œearly exitâ€� - the ability to quit the execution of a given function or method from any place of itâ€™s body (most-oftenly by using the keyword <code>return</code>) as opposed to executing the function to the end. So again if we consider our plain old <code>if</code> <code>else</code> statement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterleve) {
    turn motor on
} else {
    turn motor off
}
...
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Using <code>return</code> we can write it like this</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterleve) {
    return turn motor on
} 
turn motor off
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When used like this, <code>return</code> is directly translatable to a <code>goto</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterleve) {
    turn motor on
    Jump to C
}
turn motor off
C:
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why not write like this? We already established that <code>goto</code> is bad and Iâ€™d argue that mixing the two approaches is even worse in some respects, as it might fool you that the code is structured when it really isnâ€™t. Furthermore, the early exit makes our code as confusing as any other <code>goto</code>-containing code when translated to natural language. Imagine someone saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œBring me a coffee if you get home early.â€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and then imagine them saying.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIf you donâ€™t get home early ignore everything Iâ€™d say after this sentence. Bring me a coffee.â€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if your language supports it, always rely on the implicit <code>return</code> instead of explicitly ending your execution. If not, the simple rule you can follow is that you should either return from all branches of the <code>if</code> statement or from none of them.</p>

<h2 id="combining-ifs-with-functions">Combining <code>if</code>â€™s with functions</h2>

<p>The most common type of situation that I have seen the premature <code>return</code> pattern is for handling errors. Imagine for example a very long function with some validation at the beginning. Many people would write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>signup (user) {

  if (username is valid ) {
      throw invalid username
  } 

  create account for user
  sign user up
  initialise some other stuff
  write action in log
  send emails
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a very subtle variant of the issue I am describing (made even more subtle by the fact that <code>throw</code> is used instead of a <code>return</code>). The correct way would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>signup (user) {

  if (username is valid ) {
      throw invalid username
  } else {
      create account for user
      sign user up
      initialise some other stuff
      write action in log
      send emails
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but people would prefer having the main function code directly in the body in order to avoid indentation (especially if there is a lot of it already). According to them (and they have a point) the error handling is somewhat outside of the domain of the function, we can perhaps say that they are at different levels of abstraction. In cases like this, we should use <em>functions</em> to structure our code and to keep the different levels of abstraction separate.</p>

<p>Functions are everything that random sequences of statement are not and can never be - they <em>have names</em>, they have <em>a separate scope</em> (blocks also have their own scope, but they also inherit the scope of the parent block), and most importantly they are <em>easy to debug</em> (e.g. you have the name of the thing that went wrong right there on the top of the stack trace. So letâ€™s look at how the code above can be made to work with functions. I think this is a very cool and underused pattern that allows you to lose the indentation without sacrificing your structure.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>
signup (user) {
  if (username is valid ) {
      throw invalid username
  } else {
      return signup internal (user)
  }
}

signup internal (user) { // or _signup as some people name it
  create account for user
  sign user up
  initialise some other stuff
  write action in log
  send emails
...
}
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This is another bad pattern that, we might say, has the same root cause as the first one - in their effort to keep things simple and concise, people donâ€™t include all the structure that needs to be there in a robust piece of code.</p>

<p>In <code>if</code> statements we often have to deal with multiple conditions that are dependent on one another. And sometimes in such cases, people try to deal with all of them in one statement with multiple branches and <code>else if</code>-s. I argue that itâ€™s actually better to have <em>one statement per condition</em> …</p></div></div>

<p>
Recently, I became interested in measuring the electricity consumption
of electronic devices at my home and, in particular, my computer. Computer power
supplies are typically rated from 400W to 800W. I wanted to see how much power is
actually needed for day-to-day computing - writing code, browsing the Internet, playing
games, running ML jobs. And how does it compare with a laptop and other mobile devices.
</p>

<p>
As a kid, I was once told by an engineer that the bulk of the energy is consumed by
the monitor, and the desktop itself consumes lesser energy<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. So if I switch off
the monitor, I can play music, download things overnight without wasting too much
energy. This statement stuck with me over time as my bulky CRT monitor was replaced
with sleek LED monitors and a beefy 250W GPU got added to my desktop. It was time
I measure everything and find out if the engineer's statement still holds.

<p>
A quick search revealed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt">Kill A Watt</a> meters are one of the most popular ways
of measuring the energy consumption. I wanted to log the consumption so that I can
analyze the trends over time. That's why I passed these meters on. But these meters
have an inbuilt screen and do not require mobile or network access so they can
be a great solution if someone is looking for a quick way to see the consumption.
On the other end of the spectrum, there are some devices that can be plugged directly
into the circuit panel of the house and they can be used to analyze consumption
of all appliances in the house. For my goal of measuring energy consumption of
my computer, this was simply overkill and would not have provided the fine-grained
monitoring I needed (and I'm a little scared of messing with the AC power).
</p>

<p>
I finally settled on TP-Link Power Strip: <a href="https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-plugs/kasa-smart-wi-fi-power-strip-hs300">HS300</a>. This <i>smart</i> power strip has
the usual <i>smart</i> plug features, like, it can be controlled using a mobile app, but
it also has energy monitoring built-in. And most importantly there are some awesome projects
on Github - <a href="https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa">python-kasa</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GadgetReactor/pyHS100">pyHS100</a> - that have reverse engineered the communication
protocol and provide a nice interface to talk to them.

<p>
The project <a href="https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa">python-kasa</a> provides a nice interface to control TP-Link devices but there's
an <a href="https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa/issues/64">issue</a> with querying the energy monitor of child plugs. That's why I used the project <a href="https://github.com/GadgetReactor/pyHS100">pyHS100</a>
which seems like an older version of the python-kasa project. I added a cron job to query
the power strip every 5 minutes and dump the data in a text file, using a simple bash script:
</p>
<div>
<pre><code>#! /bin/bash

power=$(/home/pi/.local/bin/pyhs100 --strip --host &lt;IP of the power strip&gt; emeter | tail -n 1)
timestamp=$(date +%s)

echo -e "$timestamp, $power"
</code></pre>

<p>
This creates a bulky line for each sample it records and there is certainly a
lot of room to compress it. I'm currently sampling it every 5 minutes, so I don't
mind it, but if you are planning to sample it every minute or every few seconds,
you might want to trim it down.

I'm using Grafana to visualize this data to see trends in usage over time. We
can dump all of the data into one of the Datasource that is supported by default
by Grafana but I did not like that extra step for such simple data. So I wrote
<a href="https://github.com/anuragpeshne/grafana-kasa-power-strip">my own backend datasource</a> that directly serves Grafana, data from the logs we
collected. This uses the <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-simple-json-datasource">SimpleJson</a> datasource plugin.

The energy consumption of the monitor is just 10% - 25% of the desktop energy consumption.
So, although it might be still a good idea to turn off the monitor when things
are running in the background, monitors are not the major consumers anymore
(if they were at all earlier). It is interesting to note that the actual
consumption is much less than the rated wattage of the devices.
</p>

<p>
It is also interesting to note the difference in magnitude of the consumption.
So getting a gold rated PSU will have much more impact than having a more efficient
iPhone charger. But none of this matters when you are sitting next to a 3KW space heater ;)

<p><strong>Encapsulation in Kubernetes</strong></p>

<p>In 2018, for various reasons we moved our website to Kubernetes. When we started, we had little idea what Kubernetes had to offer. All we knew was that it can run a website based on containers that are full OS images. It is easier to move from one cloud provider to another. Cool! Little did we know the biggest advantage it offers: Encapsulation.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of Kubernetes in my opinion is the encapsulation and composability of backend components. Any Saas product has to run a number of components from database, appserver, monitoring stack, pub/sub etc etc. Kubernetes makes everything a helm chart and some configuration away. The interfaces are neatly defined by the author of the helm chart and all the complexity is encapsulated well within a service. You could use many third party helm charts:
Monitoring: logging - Elasticsearch
Monitoring: metrics - Prometheus
Authentication - FusionAuth
Database - MongoDB
Chaos Monkey - Gremlin
CD - Argo
…
This abstraction of complexity lets every team focus on its unique IP and easily reuse third party components. Now why was it not possible before? VM images were too big, needed a lot of time to boot and it was hard to maintain a lot of them.</p>

<p>Composability is not just limited to third party components. Even your own code becomes very composable with well defined interfaces. Now how should we decide the boundary between two components in a Kubernetes cluster? The same priciples that apply in designing a database or paritioning a program to classes is useful here but with slightly different parameters. When we decide what should go into a class, we use the priciple of loose coupling and strong cohesion: The interface between classes
should be simple and the complexity can be captured inside the class. Also, strong cohesion means methods and properties inside the class should be related to each other: they should change together. A change in behavior should as much as possible be confined within the class.</p>

<p>Choosing the boundary of Kubernetes components depends on a few things apart from the Simplicity of the interface: 
Single process: Everything in one component should run as a single process/container. It should have the same dependencies. You dont really have to worry about this because you pretty much have little choice.
Configurability of the component: IF a configuration change requires the restart of certain parts, they should be in the same component.
Auto-scaling policies for the component. If one component is CPU bound and needs CPU scaling whereas other needs Memory based autoscaling, they should be in different components.
We should strive to decouple state of the containers from the runtime as much as possible, by using databases and volume claims. But ideally one component should not have too many different types of state.</p>

<p>It can also be thought of as taking a UML component diagram and giving each component a container of its own. The concept of components in UML closely resembles an image.</p>

<p>Now, let’s say someday that the component configuration is super easy and the  configuration/maintenance of these components rests in the hands of the creator of the component itself (for a fee of course).  The frontend app developer would go hire some of these backend components, configure them together and a new app is ready to run! The road will not be easy but this will be true low-code where complex services can be built by just knowing UI programming.</p>

		<p>A man brewed a tea from “magic mushrooms” and injected the concoction into his veins; several days later, he ended up at the emergency department with the fungus growing in his blood.</p>
<p>The man spent 22 days in the hospital, with eight of those days in the intensive care unit (ICU), where he received treatment for multisystem organ failure. Now released, he is still being treated with a long-term regimen of antibiotic and antifungal drugs, according to a description of the case published Jan. 11 in the <u>Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry</u>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case didn’t reveal whether injecting <u>shroom tea</u> can cause persistent psychoactive effects, as sometimes seen when people ingest the <u>fungus</u> orally, the doctors wrote in the report. For example, in rare cases, people can develop a condition called hallucinogen-induced persisting perception disorder (HPPD), where they experience vivid flashbacks of their trip long after the fact, <u>according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse</u>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The case “underscores the need for ongoing public education regarding the dangers attendant to the use of this, and other drugs, in ways other than they are prescribed,” the doctors wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By injecting shrooms into his bloodstream, the 30-year-old patient had hoped to relieve symptoms of bipolar disorder and opioid dependence, according to the report. His family members noted that he had recently stopped adhering to his prescribed bipolar medications and was “cycling between depressive and manic states.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man found online reports that described the potential therapeutic effects of hallucinogens, such as <u>LSD</u> and psilocybin mushrooms, which prompted him to boil down shrooms into a “mushroom tea.” He filtered the tea by drawing it through a “cotton swab” before injecting it into his body. In the following days, he became lethargic and nauseated, and his skin began to yellow. He soon developed diarrhea and began vomiting blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His family found him and took him to the emergency room, noting concern that he also seemed very confused. The doctors noted that he could not participate in a meaningful interview, due to his altered mental state. Multiple organs, including the liver and kidneys, began to fail and the man was transferred to the ICU. His blood tested positive for a <u>bacterial</u> infection with the microbe <em>Brevibacillus </em>and a fungal infection from <em>Psilocybe cubensis </em>— meaning the magic mushroom he injected was now growing in his blood.</p>
<p>In addition to antibiotic and antifungal drugs, the man needed to be placed on a ventilator after he experienced acute respiratory failure, where fluid builds up in the air sacs of the lungs. Thankfully, the patient survived this ordeal and was later discharged from the hospital.</p>

<p>—10 of the strangest medical studies (in recent history, that is)</p>
<p>—Hypersex to hoarding: 7 new psychological disorders&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research suggests that psilocybin may be a promising treatment for <u>depression</u>, <u>anxiety</u> and substance abuse, the authors noted — but only if taken safely. In most research studies, scientists administer the drug in pill form, but in a few instances, doctors have delivered psilocybin via an intravenous injection, according to a 2018 report published in the journal <u>Neuropharmacology</u>. But these injections are given in tightly controlled doses and under medical supervision, and they do not contain any fungi; the compound psilocybin, alone, is not alive and cannot grow in the body.</p>
<p>When used recreationally, magic mushrooms are typically made into a tea, eaten raw or dried, ground into a powder and put in capsules, or coated in chocolate — they are not injected directly into the bloodstream. Shrooms induce mind-altering trips by interacting with certain receptors in the brain; specifically, the psilocybin breaks down into psilocin, a substance that acts like the brain chemical serotonin, which plays roles in mood and perception.</p>
<p>But a bad trip can trigger anxiety, fear and confusion, as well as elevated blood pressure, vomiting, headaches and stomach cramps, <u>Live Science previously reported</u>. Magic mushrooms carry an added risk because they resemble some species of poisonous mushroom, so people sometimes consume the wrong kind by mistake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several U.S. cities have decriminalized psilocybin, and in November 2020, Oregon moved to legalize its use as a therapeutic drug, <u>CNBC reported</u>. As of now, psilocybin is still classified as a “Schedule I substance” under federal law, meaning that the drug has no accepted medical use in the U.S. and has a “high potential for abuse.” However, current research suggests that this potential for abuse has been historically overestimated and is actually quite low, according to the 2018 Neuropharmacology report.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Hey there. This is the first post I will be making here, and I wanted to give a
tour of Self before making posts about my current implementation, mySelf.</p>
<p>Throughout this post, I will be showing examples from the regular implementation
of the Self programming environment, available
<a href="https://github.com/russellallen/self">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-self">What is Self?</h2>
<p>To quote the <a href="https://selflanguage.org/">Self language homepage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Self is a prototype-based dynamic object-oriented programming language,
environment, and virtual machine centered around the principles of simplicity,
uniformity, concreteness, and liveness. Self includes a programming language, a
collection of objects defined in the Self language, and a programming
environment built in Self for writing Self programs. The language and
environment attempt to present objects to the programmer and user in as direct
and physical a way as possible. The system uses the prototype-based style of
object construction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self was designed at Xerox PARC by David Ungar and Randall B. Smith in 1986, and
was implemented at Stanford University. Development then continued at Sun
Microsystems before eventually stopping in the early 2000s.</p>
<h2 id="an-introduction-to-self">An introduction to Self</h2>
<p>Self is an image-based programming language, similar to Smalltalk. It provides
a <em>programming environment</em> that you interact with as the system is running. The
runtime is based on the idea of “processes”: each piece of Self code you run has
its own process (not an OS process – a Self process) in which it runs until
termination. During its runtime it can interact with other objects it can reach,
and create new ones.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/processes.png" alt="Two processes: The left one is the scheduler (the root process), and the right one is a short-lived one created by the shell when I typed process this and evaluated it."> <figcaption>
            <p>Two processes: The left one
is the scheduler (the root process), and the right one is a short-lived one
created by the shell when I typed <code>process this</code> and evaluated it.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each object holds a number of slots, which can be added to and removed from
(facilitated by the programming environment). Slots can be mutable, in which
case they accept a message with their name and the new value as an argument.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/slots.png" alt="This object has a mutable slot named foo (marked by the colon on the right). I can send it a message like foo: &amp;lsquo;bar&amp;rsquo; to set the value it points at to &amp;lsquo;bar&amp;rsquo;. Constant slots (like parent above) are marked with an equals sign."> <figcaption>
            <p>This object has a mutable slot
named <code>foo</code> (marked by the colon on the right). I can send it a
message like <code>foo: ‘bar’</code> to set the value it points at to ‘bar’.
Constant slots (like <code>parent</code> above) are marked with an equals sign.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Objects can also hold code when they are assigned to a slot, in which case the
slot is called a <em>method</em>, and the code will be executed when a message is sent
to that slot. Methods can take arguments, and the keywords for each argument
after the first must start with a capital letter (due to the way message
precedence works in Self).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/methods.png" alt="This object holds a method called bark, which will pop up a dialog box when it receives a message."> <figcaption>
            <p>This object holds a method
called <code>bark</code>, which will pop up a dialog box when it receives a
message.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Self, unlike most object-oriented languages, is one which employs <em>prototypes</em>
for inheritance (like Javascript). Prototypes are objects which are the
canonical instance of a type. New “instances” are created by copying, or
cloning, the prototype and modifying its properties. Cloning is the only way to
create new “instances” in Self.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/cloning.png" alt="Cloning a vector. The object
on the left is the vector prototype, and the one on the right is the &amp;ldquo;instance&amp;rdquo;
that I have created by cloning the prototype, marked by the &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; before its name."> <figcaption>
            <p>Cloning a vector. The object
on the left is the vector prototype, and the one on the right is the “instance”
that I have created by cloning the prototype, marked by the “a” before its name.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, if you know a bit about Smalltalk (and Objective-C, sort of), in the
previous picture you might have spotted that I sent a message named <code>size</code> in
order to get the size of the newly created vector. You might ask “how did the
vector know how to respond to <code>size</code>”? That’s where <em>parent slots</em> come in.
In the image, <code>parent</code> is marked with a <code>*</code>, which signifies that it is a parent
slot. When a message is to be sent to a Self object, first the regular slots of
the object is searched, and if the slot is not found there, the parent is
searched, and this operation continues recursively until it reaches an object
which doesn’t have a parent (for most Self objects, this is <code>globals</code>, which
we will talk more about later).</p>
<p>Note that parent slots can be mutable too. You can change the behavior of an
object while it exists in Self (dynamic inheritance!).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/parent_slot.png" alt="vector&amp;rsquo;s parent slot traits vector contains the defintion for the message size."> <figcaption>
            <p><code>vector</code>’s
parent slot <code>traits vector</code> contains the defintion for the message
<code>size</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One more thing you need to know about is <em>blocks</em>, which you might be familiar
with if you know Smalltalk or Objective-C. They are objects which hold a block
of code, and they execute the code and return the value when they are sent the
<code>value</code> message (they are just regular objects with special syntax, after all).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/blocks.png" alt="A block which reports the
number it is given."> <figcaption>
            <p>A block which reports the
number it is given.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is almost all of the Self syntax. There is not much else to talk about with
regards to the language itself, because the rest of the Self system is
constructed in the programming environment.</p>
<h2 id="the-self-programming-environment">The Self Programming Environment</h2>
<p>All of the screenshots that I showed you were from Morphic, Self’s programming
environment interface. In Self, the easiest way to interact with the system is
by using the programming environment. The user interface is built using Morphic,
which is the UI framework powering the environment, built on X11 on GNU/Linux
and Quartz on macOS.</p>
<p>When you first start the <code>morphic</code> or <code>kitchensink</code> snapshots, you are greeted
with something like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/self_window.png" alt="The initial window."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial window.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From here, there are a few ways you can start using the programming environment.
First thing you should know is that there are usually two types of context menus
for each <em>morph</em> (widget or layout, in modern terms) in the workspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>object menu</em>, which contains operations related to the functionality of
the morph. This can be setting the target for a button, or adding a slot to the
object that the outliner points to. It is opened with the middle click.</li>
<li>The <em>morph menu</em>, which contains operations related to the morph itself, and
ways of modifying it. For instance, you can click <code>Resize</code> to resize the
morph. It is opened with the right click.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/menus.png" alt="The object (yellow) and morph
(blue) menus."> <figcaption>
            <p>The object (yellow) and morph
(blue) menus.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you want to do something to what the morph is showing, you middle click it.
If you want to change the morph itself, you right click it.</p>
<p>The background (called world, or root) is middle-clickable, as well, and
contains many important menu items. It is where you find the options to create a
new object, and references to some important objects in the Self environment.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/bg_menu.png" alt="The background (rootMorph) menu."> <figcaption>
            <p>The background (<code>rootMorph</code>) menu.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>
<p>Let’s build the standard FizzBuzz as an example, going through the Self
programming environment while we do so. First off, let’s create a new object and
give it a few slots. <code>parent</code> will help us access the rest of the Self
environment via its value, <code>traits oddball</code> (trait for objects that are
one-of-a-kind, singleton if you must); <code>n</code>, which will be a mutable slot holding
the current number; and <code>fizzBuzzList</code>, which is what we will store our results
in (because we don’t have a terminal to print to). To do this, I first
middle-click the world and create a new object. Then I middle-click the outliner
(which are morphs that list the slots in an object, like an inspector) for the
new object, and select “Add Slot”. This opens an editor in which I can enter the
code for this slot. I enter the slot values for <code>parent</code>, <code>fizzBuzzList</code> and
<code>n</code>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/add_slot.png" alt="Adding a slot to the new object."> <figcaption>
            <p>Adding a slot to the new object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/slot_editor.png" alt="The editor for the new slot."> <figcaption>
            <p>The editor for the new slot.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One thing to note is that we can do the association of slots with values
completely interactively. Let’s do this for the <code>fizzBuzzList</code> slot. First, I
will middle-click the world and select “Globals”, which will open the <code>globals</code>
object containing all world-reachable objects in Self (of which there are many).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/globals.png" alt="The globals object."> <figcaption>
            <p>The globals object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then I find the object I want (<code>sequence</code> for storing a sequence of values),
which is under <code>core &gt; collections &gt; ordered</code>. The standard library is nicely
organized and it is a lot of fun to discover what is available visually.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/find_sequence.png" alt="Finding sequence in globals."> <figcaption>
            <p>Finding <code>sequence</code> in <code>globals</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We then fetch the object by clicking the symbol on its right, and create an
instance of it by opening the prompt and sending it the message
<code>copyRemoveAll</code> to get a sequence with no values in it.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/sequence_copy.png" alt="Copying the sequence prototype."> <figcaption>
            <p>Copying the sequence prototype.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, I can associate this object with the <code>fizzBuzzList</code> slot in my new
object. I click the symbol next to <code>fizzBuzzList</code>, which pulls down <code>nil</code>. I
then drag the connector from <code>nil</code> to the new <code>sequence</code> instance I just
created, and it is now set. Of course, this is much easier to do by setting the
value of <code>fizzBuzzList</code> to <code>sequence copyRemoveAll</code> during slot creation, but
this allows you to set the value of slots to objects that are not well-known
(cannot be reached from <code>globals</code>), like the instance of <code>sequence</code> we had just
created. Plus, it is super cool to navigate the standard libarary.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/tour1/drag_connector.png" alt="Dragging the connector to the sequence."> <figcaption>
            <p>Dragging the connector to the sequence.</p>

of our object, with all the slots we need."> <figcaption>
            <p>The final version
of our object, with all the slots we need.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now let’s evaluate some code to fill up that sequence. I click the “E” icon on
the top right corner of the object to open up a <em>prompt</em>. I can then enter code
here, and either “get it” (getting the result of the last statement) or “do it”
(just execute the code without grabbing any value).</p>
<p>This is the code for FizzBuzz:</p>

				<p>This case was reported in the <em>Saint Bartholomew’s Hospital Reports </em>– the in-house journal published by the London hospital of the same name – in 1879. The author of this article, William Steavenson, was a 29-year-old house physician at Barts (as those familiar with the hospital call it). Steavenson’s interests included chronic asthma – from which he had suffered since childhood – and the uses of electricity in medicine, about which he wrote a textbook which was published on both sides of the Atlantic. He died at the tragically early age of 41 – killed by influenza, a vulnerable person during another terrible pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hemiplegia.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hemiplegia.jpg" alt="unusual cause of hemiplegia" width="483" height="131" srcset="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hemiplegia.jpg 774w, http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hemiplegia-300x81.jpg 300w, http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Hemiplegia-768x208.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px"></a></p>
<p><em>J.D., aged 21, a gentleman’s groom, was admitted into St. Bartholomew’s Hospital on April 23, 1879, recovering from right hemiplegia.</em></p>
<p>Hemiplegia is a form of paralysis affecting one side of the body. It is most often caused by injury to the brain or (sometimes) spine.</p>
<p><em>About sixteen months before, at his master’s residence in the country, when larking in the servants’ hall, he attempted to kiss the kitchen-maid.</em></p>
<p>An act that would not be described as ‘larking’ by many employers today. The question of whether the maid had the slightest interest in being kissed by the groom is not addressed.</p>
<p><em>This young person had been engaged in knitting, and had one of the knitting-needles placed behind her left ear.</em></p>
<p>Can you guess what happened next?</p>
<p><em>As the face of the groom approached that of the young woman, the knitting-needle entered his left orbit, passing between the bone and the eyeball, to the depth, it is said, of four inches, no doubt entering the brain.</em></p>
<p>Or around 10 cm. Quite a long way into the brain, in all likelihood.</p>
<p><em>It must be supposed that the ardour of the young man was extreme, and that most likely the needle obtained a&nbsp;</em>point&nbsp;d’appui<em>&nbsp;</em><em>in the lady’s back hair</em>…</p>
<p>A <em>point d’appui </em>(literally, ‘fulcrum’) is a military term meaning a base or strong point.</p>
<p><em>…but such was the confusion following the occurrence that the history on these points is not very clear; but this much is certain, that J. D. retired from the encounter with the knitting-needle protruding from his orbit.</em></p>
<p>A vignette of extreme horror or high slapstick, depending on your point of view.</p>
<p><em>He says he removed it with his own hand.</em></p>
<p>Not, in general, a good idea. If in doubt, leave a foreign object in place and let a doctor take it out for you.</p>
<p><em>It was followed by some bleeding, and he then fainted. </em></p>
<p>Understandably.</p>
<p><em>We therefore have no accurate knowledge of the exact direction of the implement, but, from the symptoms which followed, it is very probable that it passed through the sphenoidal fissure, and must ultimately have injured the brain somewhere in the neighbourhood of the third left frontal convolution, or what is called Broca’s convolution</em>.</p>
<p>The sphenoidal or superior orbital fissure is a gap between two bones at the back of the eye socket. More interesting, however, is the reference to ‘Broca’s convolution’ (known today as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area">Broca’s area</a>), a region of the left frontal lobe of the brain.</p>
<p>In the 1860s a physician in France, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Broca">Pierre Paul Broca</a>, encountered several patients with aphasia (inability to speak) who all turned out to have lesions in the same region of the brain. This was the first convincing evidence for the localisation of brain function – the idea that particular areas of the brain perform specialised tasks. Experimental work over the following decades established that other parts of the brain were associated with other functions such as locomotion and sensory abilities.</p>
<p>In the hospital post-mortem room, Dr Steavenson performed experiments on several cadavers, passing knitting needles through their eye sockets to find out which parts of the brain might be injured, and found that it was quite feasible for a needle to reach Broca’s area. Half a century later the Edinburgh surgeon David Greig <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5305753/?page=23">performed a similar experiment</a> (using a skull rather than a complete cadaver) and X-rayed the results, demonstrating the range of angles at which a knitting needle might enter the brain via this route:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4135" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4135"><a href="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skull-needle.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skull-needle.jpg" alt="x-ray of skull with needles" width="720" height="536" srcset="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skull-needle.jpg 720w, http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/skull-needle-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4135">X-ray of skull (1924) showing range of possible angles taken by knitting needle through the orbit</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for Dr Steavenson’s patient:</p>
<p><em>The injury at the time caused the patient intense pain, but did not injure his sight. Up to the fifth day after the accident he could talk and use his right arm and leg. Then he lost all power over his right upper extremity, side, and leg. The lower part of the right side of his face was paralysed, and he could not whistle. The right side of the tongue was also paralysed. The paralysis came on at night. At first the paralysed parts felt cold and dead, but he did not lose sensation. He lost the power of speech for two months.</em></p>
<p>The symptom observed by Broca in his patients, known clinically as aphasia.</p>
<p><em>On his admission to the Salop Infirmary at Shrewsbury a short time after the accident, he could only say the words “Yes, yes,” which he answered to every question.</em></p>
<p>Broca’s first patient could only utter the syllable ‘tan’, and would respond to any question with the phrase ‘tan, tan’.</p>
<p><em>The almost total paralysis remained as long as the aphasia, viz., for two months. He never lost power over his sphincters. He is now gradually recovering power over all the paralysed parts. Occasionally he has severe aching in the back of his head and on the left side of his neck, which lasts for some hours. His memory is good. He has had three epileptiform fits since the accident, one in December 1878, one in February of this year, and one in April a few days before admission.</em></p>
<p>The patient was, it seems, somewhat improved by the time he was transferred to Bart’s.</p>
<p><em>On admission, he had the appearance of being a strong, robust man in perfect health, with a florid complexion. He complained of inability to use his right hand or fingers, with weakness and only partial power over his right side, arm, and lower extremity…He remained under observation about five weeks, with galvanism applied to his arm and hand…</em></p>
<p>Galvanism is the medical use of electricity, often used at this date to treat paralysis. Since it had long been known that muscle fibres contracted when a current was passed through them, it seemed logical to apply electricity in this way. Dr Steavenson was an acknowledged authority on the subject, appointed the first head of the Barts <a href="http://www.calmhosting01.com/BartsHealth/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=SBHB%2FEC">Electrical Department</a> on its foundation in 1882.</p>
<p><em>…the hand placed in the intervals upon a splint to try and bring the fingers straight, but very little improvement was observed in his condition from the time when he entered the Hospital. The contraction and rigidity of the flexors of the forearm were of too old standing to expect much improvement. He had no fits while under treatment</em></p>
<p>The human brain is a remarkable thing, but its ability to heal after physical injury is limited. There was nothing the doctors could do for this patient beyond careful rehabilitation, but he still seems to have recovered most of the function he lost in the immediate aftermath of the accident. The fact that he even survived four inches of knitting needle inside his skull is pretty extraordinary.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Recently, Daniel Lemire <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2019/05/07/almost-picking-n-distinct-numbers-at-random/">tackled the topic</a> of selecting N <em>distinct</em> numbers at random. In the case we want sorted output, an obvious solution presents itself: sorting randomly chosen values and de-duplicating the list, which is easy since identical values are now adjacent.<sup id="fnref:distinct" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:distinct">1</a></sup></p>

<p>While Daniel suggests a clever method of avoiding a sort entirely<sup id="fnref:danmethod" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:danmethod">2</a></sup>, I’m also interested in they <em>why</em> for the underlying performace of the sort method: it takes more than 100 ns per element, which means 100s of CPU clock cycles and usually even more instructions than that (on a superscalar processor)! As a sanity check, a quick benchmark (<code>perf record ./bench &amp;&amp; perf report</code>) shows that more than 90% of the time spent in this approach is in the sorting routine, <a href="https://devdocs.io/c/algorithm/qsort">qsort</a> - so we are right to focus on this step, rather than say the de-duplication step or the initial random number generation. This naturally, this raises the question: how fast is qsort when it comes to sorting integers and can we do better?</p>

<p>All of the code for this post <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/sort-bench">is available on GitHub</a>, so if you’d like to follow along with the code open in an editor, go right ahead (warning: there are obviously some spoilers if you dig through the code first).</p>

<h2 id="benchmarking-qsort">Benchmarking Qsort</h2>

<p>First, let’s take a look at what <code>qsort</code> is doing, to see if there is any delicous low-hanging performance fruit. We use <code>perf record ./bench qsort</code> to capture profiling data, and <code>perf report --stdio</code> to print a summary<sup id="fnref:long-tail" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:long-tail">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p>The assembly for the biggest offender, <code>msort_with_tmp</code> looks like this<sup id="fnref:annotate-command" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:annotate-command">4</a></sup> :</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Depending on your level of assembly reading skill, it may not be obvious, but this is basically a classic merge routine: it is merging two lists by comparing the top elements of each list (pointed to by <code>r13</code> and <code>r15</code>), and then storing the smaller element (the line <code>QWORD PTR [rbx],rax</code>) and loading the next element from that list. There are also two checks for termination (<code>test   r12,r12</code> and <code>test   rbp,rbp</code>). This hot loop corresponds directly to this code from <code>glibc</code> (from the file<code>msort.c</code><sup id="fnref:msort-note" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:msort-note">5</a></sup>) :</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n1</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>n2</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

    <span>tmp</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>(</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This loop suffers heavily from branch mispredictions, since the “which element is larger” branch is highly unpredictable (at least for random-looking input data). Indeed, we see roughly 128 million mispredicts while sorting ~11 million elements: close to 12 mispredicts per element.</p>

<p>We also note the presence of the indirect call at the <code>call r14</code> line. This corresponds to the <code>(*cmp) (b1, b2, arg)</code> expression in the source: it is calling the user provided comparator function through a function pointer. Since the <code>qsort()</code> code is compiled ahead of time and is found inside the shared libc binary, there is no chance that the comparator, passed as a function pointer, can be inlined.</p>

<p>The comparator function I provide looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>compare_uint64_t</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>l_</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>r_</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

mov    edx,0xffffffff
cmp    QWORD PTR [rdi],rax
seta   al
movzx  eax,al
cmovb  eax,edx
ret
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the comparator has to redundantly load from memory the two locations to compare, something the merge loop already did (the merge loop reads them because it is responsible for moving the elements).</p>

<p>How much better could things get if we inline the comparator into the merge loop? That’s what we do in <code>qsort-inlined</code><sup id="fnref:inline-hard" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:inline-hard">6</a></sup>, and here’s the main loop which now includes the comparator function<sup id="fnref:cmdline1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cmdline1">7</a></sup> :</p>

<pre><code> 0.07 :   401dc8:       test   rbp,rbp
 0.66 :   401dcb:       je     401e0c &lt;void msort_with_tmp&lt;CompareU64&gt;(msort_param const*, void*, unsigned long, CompareU64)+0xbc&gt;
 3.51 :   401dcd:       mov    rax,QWORD PTR [r9]
 5.00 :   401dd0:       lea    rdx,[rbx+0x8]
 1.62 :   401dd4:       mov    rcx,QWORD PTR [rbx]
 0.24 :   401dd7:       lea    r8,[r9+0x8]
 6.96 :   401ddb:       cmp    rax,rcx
20.83 :   401dde:       cmovbe r9,r8
 8.88 :   401de2:       cmova  rbx,rdx
 0.27 :   401de6:       cmp    rcx,rax
 6.23 :   401de9:       sbb    r8,r8
 0.74 :   401dec:       cmp    rcx,rax
 4.93 :   401def:       sbb    rdx,rdx
 0.24 :   401df2:       not    r8
 6.69 :   401df5:       add    rbp,rdx
 0.44 :   401df8:       cmp    rax,rcx
 5.34 :   401dfb:       cmova  rax,rcx
 5.96 :   401dff:       add    rdi,0x8
 7.48 :   401e03:       mov    QWORD PTR [rdi-0x8],rax
 0.00 :   401e07:       add    r15,r8
 0.71 :   401e0a:       jne    401dc8 &lt;void msort_with_tmp&lt;CompareU64&gt;(msort_param const*, void*, unsigned long, CompareU64)+0x78&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A key difference is that the core of the loop is now branch free. Yes, there are still two conditional jumps, but they are both just checking for the termination condition (that one of the lists to merge is exhausted), so we expect this loop to be free of branch mispredictions other than the final iteration. Indeed, we measure with <code>perf stat</code> that the misprediction rate has dropped from to close to 12 mispredicts per element to around 0.75 per element. The loop has only two loads and one store, so the memory access redundancy between the merge code and the comparator has been eliminated<sup id="fnref:load-redundancy" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:load-redundancy">8</a></sup>. Finally, the comparator does a three-way compare (returning distrinct results for <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>==</code>), but the merge code only needs a two-way compare (<code>&lt;=</code> or <code>&gt;</code>) - inlining the comparator manages to remove extra code associated with distinguishing the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>==</code> cases.</p>

<p>What’s the payoff? It’s pretty big:</p>

<p><img src="https://travisdowns.github.io/assets/2019-05-22/fig2.svg" alt="Effect of comparator inlining"></p>

<p>The speedup hovers right around 1.77x. Note that this is much larger than simply eliminating all the time spent in the separate comparator function in the original version (about 17% of the time implying a speedup of 1.2x if all the function time disapeared). This is a good example of how inlining isn’t just about removing function call overhead but enabling further <em>knock on</em> optimizations which can have a much larger effect than just removing the overhead associated with function calls.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-c">What about C++?</h2>

<p>Short of copying the existing glibc (note: LGPL licenced) sorting code to allow inlining, what else can we do to speed things up? I’m writing in C++, so how about the C++ sort functions available in the <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> header? Unlike C’s <code>qsort</code> which is generic by virtue of taking a function pointer and information about the object size, the C++ sort functions use templates to achieve genericity and so are implemented directly in header files. Since the sort code and the comparator are being compiler together, we expect the comparator to be easily inlined, and perhaps other optimizations may occur.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s just throw <code>std::sort</code>, <code>std::stable_sort</code> and <code>std::partial_sort</code> into the mix:</p>

<p><img src="https://travisdowns.github.io/assets/2019-05-22/fig3.svg" alt="C vs C++ sort functions"></p>

<p>The C++ sort functions, other than perhaps <code>std::partial_sort</code><sup id="fnref:partial-sort" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:partial-sort">9</a></sup>, put in a good showing. It is interesting that <code>std::stable_sort</code> which has <em>stricly more requirements</em> on its implementation than <code>std::sort</code> (i.e., any stable sort is also suitable for <code>std::sort</code>) ends up faster. I re-wrote this paragaph several times, since sometimes after a reboot <code>stable_sort</code> was slower and sometimes it was faster (as shown above). When it was “fast” it had less than 2% branch mispredictions, and when it was slow it was at 15%. So perhaps there was some type of aliasing issue in the branch predictor which depends on the physical addresses assigned, which can vary from run to run, I’m not sure. See <sup id="fnref:stablesort" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stablesort">10</a></sup> for an old note from when <code>std::stable_sort</code> was slower.</p>

<h2 id="can-we-do-better">Can we do better?</h2>

<p>So that’s as fast as it gets, right? We aren’t going to beat <code>std::sort</code> or <code>std::stable_sort</code> without a huge amount of effort, I think? After all, these are presumably highly optimized sorting routines written by the standard library implementors. Sure, we might expect to be able to beat <code>qsort()</code>, but that’s mostly because of built-in disadvantages that <code>qsort</code> has, lacking the ability to inline the comparator, etc.</p>

<h3 id="radix-sort-attempt-1">Radix Sort Attempt 1</h3>

<p>Well, one thing we can try is a non-comparison sort. We know we have integer keys, so why stick to comparing …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<div><p>Finally, almost 3 months after it released, I can stop thinking about Gutwhale.</p><p>

<h2>the endless gamejam</h2>

<div><p>A few years ago I only did gamejams.<br> 
Gamejams are essentially deadlines, forcing you finish something. <br>
I also did a lot of short jams alone, where i would sit down and give myself 30 minutes to make a prototype.<br>
Many of the gifs I post on twitter are the results of these solo jams.</p><p> 

This helped me to learn to code and to design and to schedule, but over time I found that simply making stuff was not enough anymore.</p><p>
What I really love is doing something new. <br>
Something that has not existed before.<br>
Finding a new angle on an old problem brings me an intense, deep joy that is really hard to describe.</p><p>

There is a lot of unexplored space in games and what I am currently really interested in is <strong>expression</strong>:<br>
How do I tell a story through a game? </p><p>
How do I communicate how I feel through videogames? </p><p>
Its really hard and kind of stupid, considering that videogames are all about endless repetition in closed systems, but its what i want to explore right now.</p><p>

And I explored it at my own pace while working as a receptionist, making games like <a href="https://www.google.com/">Up in the sky</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/">Every Wall</a>.
</p></div>

<h2>the important thing</h2>
<div><p>There is a game developer called <a href="https://twitter.com/miziziziz">miziziziz</a>, one of the few who makes watchable youtube videos, 
who made a commercial game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1232330/Theyest_Thou">Theyes Thou</a> in one month.</p><p>

When I lost my job as a receptionist because of the coronavirus, I decided to steal that idea.<br>
Since I am not overly interested in traditional FUN game design, I needed to make something that felt new to me. <br>
I needed to make a game that actually said something about the world we move through everyday. Just making an entertainment box would have been too boring and unfocused. </p><p>

But since I was unemployed I felt like I needed to make something that at least had a shot at commercial viability. One month is not a lot of time, but I needed to come up with something that people would also want to pay for.
<br>
The roguelike we ended up making contains a short section at the end where I try to actually say something, where I try to express myself. This part of the game was important to me, the rest was just decorations. <br>
I wanted people to buy the game because it looked like a nice little roguelike, and then, in the end, I wanted them to engage with this secret part of the game that was actually important to me. </p><p>

And I had one month to make that real.</p></div>

<h2>the power of deadlines</h2>
<p>Gutwhale is a product of its deadline.<br> 
All of it was made in the easiest way possible. The code is a mess of course, but I want to talk more about the decisions, forced upon us by the deadline, that permeate the whole project:<br></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Gutwhale is only called Gutwhale because the project needed an artist.
<a href="https://twitter.com/franek">Franek</a> is very good at making pixelart and he, for whatever reason, also loves to draw whales. So when he was on the fence about joining the project, I quickly changed the setting to take place inside of a whale. This does not make a lot of sense, but Franek got to draw a whale and the game had an artist.
<br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gutwhale used to take place on a single screen, because then I would not have to write a camera system. When it turned out that a single screen was pretty boring, we just glued multiple single screens together and make the floor break once all enemies were defeated. The core loop of Gutwhale was born out of not wanting to code a camera system.
<br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The small size of the Levels themselves helped me in a lot of ways. The level generation code does not need to consider unreachable platforms and could be hacked together violently. Because there is so little space to move around in, enemies become more dangerous and I needed to code less of them to fill the game.<br></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The deadline forced me to think quickly and to design dirtily, accidentally disovering some pretty neat things.<br>
It certainly has also hurt the game in a lot of ways.
<br></p>

<h2>the cost of deadlines</h2>

<p>Gutwhale is unbalanced in both directions. <br></p>

<div><p>For people with little to no platformer roguelike experience, it is extremely hard.minutes and then give up, never to touch the game again.</p><p>

For people who played downwell and gonner, it is a piece of cake and they can 100% the game in around 20 minutes. There is an endless nightmare mode, but it did not have an engaging highscore system, so the best players of Gutwhale quickly got bored.</p><p>

The save system of Gutwhale had horrible bugs and there were technical problems all over the place, prohibitung us from implementing Achievements and updating the game easily.<br>
We used Construct 2, an engine that is no longer supported by its developers in favour of Construct 3. This made it impossible to add Steam Achievements and created some other technical problems.
<br>
And these problems are just that: <br>
Problems. </p><p>

They exist because we rushed through development at an insane speed and I can forgive myself for making them, because I was actually focusing on this one secret thing at the end.
</p><p>
<strong>BUT</strong></p><p>
The part of the game that is most important to me, the ending, is also not working as intended. I was unable to clearly communicate what I wanted to communicate. 
<br>
There was not enough time to conduct long term playtests and interview players about how they perceived the ending.<br>
There was not enough time for me to really reflect and ponder and tweak and adjust the ending of Gutwhale.<br>
I started the project as a compromise between compelling gameplay and a secret, expressive part, which enabled me to keep working on the game.<br>
And that part did not work. It did not resonate. <br>
At least it feels like that to me now.</p></div>

<h2>the nice things</h2>

<p>Gutwhale was a success overall: <br></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It made me more money than I would have earned at my previous job, but not nearly enough to not have to go back to that job in 7 days.<br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may make substantially more money on consoles or in bundles in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gave me a better understanding of how to sell stuff on steam.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and last but defenitly not least, I got to work with Franek, Britt Brady and Clovelt who have thaught me a lot and are amazing people.
<br></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>conclusion</h2>

<div><p>Finishing games is hard. <br>
Really hard. <br>
As a way to deal with this, a series of game jams has been created, where speed is key and the end product is only as important as the fact that it got finished.<br>
We have seen amazing games made in insanely short times and countless people have been able to dabble in game dev because of the contained nature of game jams.</p><p>

<strong>BUT</strong></p><p>
Applying this need for speed to bigger projects creates dynamics that should not be confused with efficiency and skill.</p><p>

The core part of Gutwhale, the one thing I was truly interested in, withered and died because of the deadline, because we were so wrapped up in getting the game done. <br>
There was simply not enough time to stop and smell the flowers.<br>
The deadline mercilessly  and in cold blood, pulled us away from being able to express ourselves.</p><p>

Gutwhale is nice and I am proud of it, but i think it is time for me to force myself to move on to a different way of development.</p><p>

When i did not know what I wanted express through the games I make, when i just wanted to MAKE, I needed frameworks to support me, to force me to do the work and to put in the hours, but after years of doing that, those structures have started to feel inhibiting in the best way possible. <br>
They are still able to teach me and to challenge me, but in the end, they are also keeping me from moving towards, to where I want to go, to do what I want to create.<br>
Deadlines keep me from really reflecting and looking at myself. They keep me from thinking about what i want to express through my work and they keep me from then actually saying that.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>You might have missed <a href="https://blog.airtable.com/airtable-platform-launch-automations-sync-apps/">the memo</a>: Airtable is ready for developers.</p><p>In the span of a year, Airtable went from a simple <a href="https://airtable.com/api">REST API</a> to now supporting <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting">scripting</a>, a <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/apps">custom apps SDK</a>, built in <a href="https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050974153-Automations-Overview">automations</a>, and a small but growing ecosystem of <a href="https://airtable.com/marketplace">third-party tools and services</a>.</p><p>As a developer looking to build on Airtable, where should you start? And what is the developer experience like?</p><p>This guide aims to help developers navigate Airtable and build great applications on this growing platform.</p><h2><em>In</em> or <em>on</em> Airtable?</h2><p>Who is your user and what do they need? This age-old question is still the first one to ask as you begin to consider which Airtable developer tools to use.</p><p>At a high-level, you can classify Airtable's suite of <a href="https://airtable.com/developers">developer tools</a> as either supporting use cases that happen inside the Airtable interface (i.e. <em>in</em> Airtable) or outside Airtable in another app or tool (i.e. <em>on</em> Airtable).</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/031_in_or_on.png" alt="in or on diagram"></p><p>When you are building <em>in</em> Airtable, the user is logged into Airtable and using your software within the Airtable interface. For any code you want to run <em>in</em> Airtable you'll be using either scripts, automations, or the custom app SDK.</p><blockquote><p>Note: Yes, I know, automations can trigger actions outside of Airtable. But by and large, the end user is <em>in</em> Airtable.</p></blockquote><p>If you are building <em>on</em> Airtable, then you are building for users outside of Airtable. This might be a custom internal tool, a dashboard built in Google Data Studio, a public Next.js website, or inside another SaaS application all together. In these use cases, you'll be using the Airtable REST API directly or using a tool like the one I helped build - <a href="https://syncinc.so/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=at-dev-guide">Sync Inc</a>.</p><p>As you decide whether to build <em>in</em> on <em>on</em> Airtable, you should consider what <a href="https://airtable.com/pricing">Airtable plan</a> your users are on as well. The REST API is available on every plan to every Airtable user. Automations are available on every plan, but capped at different limits. Meanwhile, scripts and custom apps are only available on pro and enterprise plans.</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/020_pricing.png" alt="pricing"></p><blockquote><p>Note: Airtable Apps were formerly known as <em>Airtable Blocks</em>. The new name is slowly catching on but you'll still see the term <em>blocks</em> pop up here and there.</p></blockquote><p>Lastly, as your considering whether to build <em>in</em> or <em>on</em> Airtable, consider the functionality you need. When building <em>in</em> Airtable, you will face a couple constraints when working with 3rd party APIs, caching data, or manipulating the UI.</p><h2>Airtable's data quirks</h2><p>It's worth touching on Airtable's data model.</p><p>From a developer's perspective, Airtable is basically a hosted database fused to an easy interface for creating and managing data. This easy-to-use interface means the database schema is super flexible. Tables, columns, and field types can emerge, change, or disappear at anytime. Airtable is highly valuable because of this flexibility, but it also makes developing on Airtable a bit more unpredictable.</p><p>Additionally, as a data store, Airtable supports all sorts of <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/cell_values">data types</a>. Most of these data types are familiar and predictable.</p><p>However, two of these data types - <code>lookups</code> and <code>formulas</code> - can take the form of any other type. This makes sense given how Airtable works: if a formula is concatenating text, then its result is a string. If it is summing numbers, then its result is a number. This means the data type of these fields is a black box, sort of like the <code>any</code> type in TypeScript.</p><p>As a #protip to deal with Airtable's data flexibility, I highly recommend developing on a "staging" copy of the Airtable base you are working with. This helps reduce the likelihood that an end user will change data as you build. And, of course, this allows you to break things, a hallmark of a great development process. Airtable can duplicate a base remarkably fast (especially when you think about what's happening under the hood!) - so use this to your advantage.</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/021_duplicate.png" alt="duplicate"></p><p>So: Which of the many options should you use to build on Airtable? Let's first consider building <em>in</em> Airtable with Airtable scripts.</p><h2>Airtable scripts: little record robots</h2><p><a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting">Airtable scripts</a> are short JavaScript snippets that allow you to manipulate data in your Airtable base.</p><p>You can do just about anything to the data in your base that is made possible with the standard JavaScript library. There are a couple limits:</p><ol><li>You can't import other JS libraries. You can copy and paste smaller, minified libraries that fit into one file - but it's usually a stretch.</li><li>You can't touch the DOM.</li><li>You can't change the schema of the base. You can't, for example, create new tables or views.</li></ol><p>To use scripts, you need to add the <em>scripting app</em> (f.k.a <em>scripting block</em>) to your base. This means you need to be on either the Pro or Enterprise Airtable plans.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Airtable now allows developers to share (no selling yet!) scripts in the <a href="https://airtable.com/marketplace/category/scripts">Airtable marketplace</a>. So if you write a killer script that is agnostic to a base, the entire community can benefit. In the marketplace you'll find all sorts of great script examples (in addition to those in the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/examples">docs</a>).</p><h3>Elements of a script</h3><p>Before diving into a hands-on example, unpacking the building blocks of Airtable scripts will set the foundation for the rest of this guide.</p><p><strong>Getting data from the base</strong></p><p>Virtually every script (or automation/app for that matter) is going to start off by pulling data from an Airtable base.</p><p>Airtable follows a pretty straightforward relational model. Let's briefly step through it:</p><p>An Airtable workspace can contain many Airtable bases. Your script will run within one of these bases.</p><p>To add a script to a base, you'll install the <a href="https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043041074-Scripting-app-overview"><strong>Scripting App</strong></a> in your base.</p><p>Then, to access information about the base in a script you'll use the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/base">base model</a>.</p><p>For instance, if you pop open the scripting app, you can quickly retrieve the name of the Airtable base:</p><pre><p><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>The name of my base is </span><span>${</span><span>base</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>.</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p>Or, get the number of tables in the base:</p><pre><p><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>This base contains </span><span>${</span><span>base</span><span>.</span><span>tables</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>}</span><span> tables.</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p>As the prior query indicates, a base can contain many tables. You can interact with tables using the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/table">table model</a>. So when you want to work with a table you retrieve it from the base:</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> table </span><span>=</span><span> base</span><span>.</span><span>getTable</span><span>(</span><span>"Tasks"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p>Once you have a table loaded into your script, you can access its <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/view">views</a>, <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/field">fields</a> and <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/record">records</a>.</p><p>A view is simply a filtered set of data in the table. So let's say you want to just pull all the records from a particular view:</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> table </span><span>=</span><span> base</span><span>.</span><span>getTable</span><span>(</span><span>"Tasks"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> view </span><span>=</span><span> table</span><span>.</span><span>getView</span><span>(</span><span>"Todo"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> query </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> view</span><span>.</span><span>selectRecordsAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p>The variable <code>query</code> is now going to contain all the records from the <code>Todo</code> view.</p><p>Now, when you want to inspect just one <code>Todo</code> record, you'll use the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/record#get-cell-value"><code>getCellValue()</code> function</a>. As so:</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> table </span><span>=</span><span> base</span><span>.</span><span>getTable</span><span>(</span><span>"Tasks"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> view </span><span>=</span><span> table</span><span>.</span><span>getView</span><span>(</span><span>"Todo"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> query </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> view</span><span>.</span><span>selectRecordsAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> record </span><span>=</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>records</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>record</span><span>.</span><span>getCellValue</span><span>(</span><span>"Description"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/032_script_example.png" alt="Script example"></p><p>This quickly outlines the practical methods for pulling data from the base. You'll find that Airtable scripts includes some other models to get information on the user (a.k.a collaborator), session and more in the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting">docs</a>. But retrieving tables and records is the crux of working with data in Airtable.</p><p><strong>Collecting input from the user</strong></p><p>Beyond pulling data from the Airtable base, you'll also want to retrieve inputs from the user.</p><p>You may want to prompt the user for which table they want to evaluate in the script or which file they want to import. To do so, you'll use the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/input">input object</a>. All input methods are asynchronous, so you'll always prefix each function call with <code>await</code>.</p><p>For instance, to ask the user their name:</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> name </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> input</span><span>.</span><span>textAsync</span><span>(</span><span>"What is your name?"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>Your name is </span><span>${</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>.</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/033_name_prompt.png" alt="Name prompt"></p><p>You can have users enter text, click a button, select a table, view, field, or even a record. Combined, these inputs allow your script to interact with the user in all sorts of ways.</p><p><strong>Fetching data from an API</strong></p><p>In addition to collecting data from the Airtable base and user, you can also <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/fetch">fetch data</a> from third-party APIs.</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://api.github.com/orgs/Airtable"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>await</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p>If the API you are calling requires authentication, your authentication token will be sitting right in the script. Keep in mind that users can view the underlying code in your script! If you don't trust the user, don't use an API fetch in your script.</p><p>Lastly, when using fetch, consider that <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/fetch#differences-from-fetch-in-the-browser">Airtable is not providing you with full fledge browser fetch</a>.</p><p><strong>Presenting data to the user</strong></p><p>Last but not least, after collecting data from the Airtable base, user or third-party API you'll then process that data and either update data in the base (using the table model functions of <code>createRecordAsync()</code>, <code>updateRecordAsync()</code>, or <code>deleteRecordAsync()</code>) or present data to the user.</p><p>To present a value to the user, you'll use the <a href="https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api/output"><code>output</code> object</a>. You might output information as the scripts run to keep your user informed or to present a final results. Here is a simple "Hello, world!":</p><pre><p><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, *world*!"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/034_output.png" alt="Output"></p><p>You can present the user plain text, markdown, or a table.</p><h3>Writing a script</h3><p>Now, let's write a quick script to put these ideas to work.</p><p>To play along with this example (and make this post more enjoyable), you can add <a href="https://airtable.com/templates/sales-and-customers/expvjTzYAZareV1pt/sales-crm">this Sales CRM base template</a> to your workspace by clicking the <strong>Use Template</strong> button.</p><p>This template base is a simple Airtable CRM for tracking sales. As an example, let's say you want to write a script to calculate the current value of all open opportunities in the sales pipeline. This will give you a sense of how much potential revenue is available to the company. To do so, you want to sum up the <code>Estimated Value</code> for all deals that are active - that is, not yet won nor lost.</p><p>First, add the scripting app to the base by clicking the <strong>APPS</strong> button and selecting <strong>+ Install an app</strong>:</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/001_add_app.png" alt="Add app"></p><p>Select the <strong>Scripting</strong> app.</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/002_select_scripting.png" alt="Scripting app"></p><p>Apps live in Airtable dashboards. So click <strong>Install app</strong> and select the <strong>Sales CRM HQ</strong> dashboard.</p><p><img src="https://blog.syncinc.so/dev-guide/003_select_dash.png" alt="Scripting app"></p><p>The scripting app will now open. Start with a blank slate by deleting the <code>Hello, World</code> example that is pre-loaded.</p><p>Now, write your script. Initiate a variable that will store the total value of the pipeline. You can call it <code>pipeline_value</code>:</p><pre><p><span>let</span><span> …</span></p></pre></div></div></div>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>In a play to convert users of their open source projects into paying customers, today Elastic announced that they are <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">changing the license</a> of both Elasticsearch and Kibana from the open source Apache v2 license to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL). If your organisation uses the open source versions of either Elasticsearch or Kibana in its products or projects, it is now at risk of being forced to release its intellectual property under terms dictated by another.</p>

<p>If you’re not yet aware of the SSPL, you can catch up <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/51230.html">here</a>. As licenses go, it’s pretty problematic from a business perspective. Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">IP lawyer</a> to whom I’ve showed the text of the SSPL has been rather alarmed before they even reach the end of it. Basically, it’s a hostile proprietary license masquerading in open source clothing. By using an SSPL project in your code, you are agreeing that if you provide an online service using that code then you will release not only that code but also the code for every supporting piece of software, all under the SSPL. It’s not a stretch to interpret the wording of the license as requiring users of the SSPL’d software therefore to release the code for everything straight down to the bare metal. There are those who will point to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">the FAQ</a> for the SSPL and claim that the license isn’t interpreted in that way because the FAQ says so. Unfortunately, when you agree to a license you are agreeing to the <em>text of that license document</em> and not to a FAQ. If the text of that license document is ambiguous, then so are your rights and responsibilities under that license. Should your compliance to that license come before a judge, it’s <em>their</em> interpretation of those rights and responsibilities that will hold sway. This ambiguity puts your organisation at risk.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">its announcement</a>, Elastic claims that this is simply a change of open source license. In one way they’re correct: they’re changing the license away from the open source Apache v2 license. However they are changing to what can best be described as a proprietary source available license, <em>not</em> to an open source one. MongoDB, the originators of SSPL, requested that <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI) (the standards body that maintains the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source Definition</a> and certifies licenses as open source) certify the SSPL as such. After a great deal of discussion among the panel of legal, licensing, and open source experts, MongoDB withdrew the SSPL from consideration as an open source license, as it appeared highly unlikely it would be certified as open source. That SSPL is not an open source license is no longer in dispute. That ship has sailed. If you have a problem with this, I suggest you <a href="https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2019-May/020483.html">take it up</a> with OSI. As for Elastic’s public and verifiably false claim that SSPL is an open source license, it’s my hope that OSI will have a conversation with them and make a public statement of their own shortly.</p>

<p>No, this is a business decision, not an ideological one. Elastic made a business decision to change to this hostile proprietary license to give them a way to <del>extort</del>influence users to become customers. Without a great deal more strategic information about Elastic’s business and operations none of us are qualified to judge whether it’s the correct decision, but the decision itself is valid. They are allowed to make this sort of strategic move for their company.</p>

<p>However, you and your organisation have now also been forced into a business decision. If your organisation uses the Apache v2 licensed Elasticsearch or Kibana in its projects or products, it must now assume that it is at risk one way or another. It can upgrade to version 7.11 of these projects, thereby accepting the terms of SSPL and potentially also being required to release the code for its entire stack (a great deal of which it will not have the copyright over and will be unable to release, thereby potentially being in violation of SSPL). It can remain on version 7.10, but then it will no longer receive future updates, including important security fixes, thereby taking on another sort of risk. It could choose to pay for a Gold+ license for the software, but it’s unlikely that the budget is prepared for this sort of unexpected expense. And finally it can rearchitect its project or product, replacing Elasticsearch and/or Kibana with alternatives. Frankly, considering today’s unfriendly move by Elastic, putting some space between it and your organisation may be the safest alternative in the long run, but it will come with its own considerable price tag in time and other potential opportunity and switching costs.</p>

<p>The one thing your organisation cannot afford to do is ignore this. It’s time to call a meeting with your legal, software development, product, finance, and strategy teams to start to figure out the best option for you.</p>

January 14, 2021 | https://www.thestartupfounder.com/looking-for-a-free-website-categorization-api-check-this-company/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.thestartupfounder.com/looking-for-a-free-website-categorization-api-check-this-company/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>Website Categorization API</strong> classifies a site into a <strong>content</strong> <strong>category</strong>. It takes a <strong>URL</strong> as an input and assigns it into the relevant industry. There’s a lot of Categorizations API available on the internet but <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> seems to be the most popular above all and should suit all your needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify’s Website Categorization API</a> uses a machine learning (ML) engine to scan a website’s content and meta tags. It extracts text to classify the site and assigns up to three categories aided by natural language processing (NLP).</p>
<p>Their offline database is perfect for customers who require a local option for domain categorization. Typical use cases include hardware/product integrations, custom applications or internal use at an Enterprise organization with high request volume.</p>
<h2><strong>How Klazify works</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> will navigate to the requested domain name or URL, collect its content,&nbsp; and determine appropriate categorizes based on a classification taxonomy: IAB V2 Standard, which can be used for 1-1 personalization, marketing segmentation, online filtering and more. The end result is that the URL or domain can now be placed in a specific category.</p>
<h2><strong>State Of The Art Accuracy</strong></h2>
<p>Their&nbsp; website categorization API is highly accurate, a simple lookup to a company’s URL will classify its industry within 385 possible topic categories.</p>
<h2><strong>Domain Processing</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a>’s domain processing begins one of two ways:</p>
<ul><li>New Domain Ingestion: Klazify examines the website, chasing new domains and re-indexing previously categorized domains.</li></ul>
<ul><li>External feeds: External data sources that are given to Klazify to process</li></ul>
<p><strong>Categorization</strong></p>
<p>Once a URL has been processed and passed the safety checks, it gets categorized.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Domain Categorization</strong></h2>
<p>There are over a lot of possible topic categories, making the list comprehensive but a little broader compared to other categorization taxonomies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/category">Klazify’s categorization</a> is ideal for internet filtering and security applications, and best thing of all? They support all the domains available and almost all the languages of the world.</p>
<p>The Classification Taxonomy that Klazify uses is from the IAB, which was referenced before. IAB stands for “Interactive Advertising Bureau.” They’ve created a standard list of categories and subcategories for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>For example, if a publisher is putting together a campaign on Google Ads and only wants to show up on specific websites, Google utilizes the IAB classification to decide which category a certain domain belongs to. This means that if publishers are using Klazify to determine if websites URLs are relevant and pertinent for them to advertise on, the categorization that is given to them in Klazify is also used on advertising websites all over the internet.</p>
<h2><strong>Advertisers</strong></h2>
<p>For Advertisers, <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> offers domain data categorized to the IAB taxonomy. Through Klazify’s API, customers can process large sets of data, allowing them to identify patterns between IPs and backlinking information or to categorize your data set. Advertisers often find this information useful in order to enhance customer demographics and better understand their behavior.</p>
<p>Once<a href="https://www.klazify.com/"> Klazify</a> finishes categorizing a domain, that domain can then have multiple categories associated with it. While a single website might only be placed in 3 categories using the IAB standards.</p>
<p>The IAB has nearly 385+ possible topic categories to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Network &amp; Cybersecurity</strong></h2>
<p>Network and Cybersecurity companies around the globe take advantage of <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify’s APIs </a>and data feeds to bring industry-leading threat intel and domain categorizations. Typical uses for Klazify include using their Domains API in order to dig deeper into network traffic or using their domain categorization API in order to categorize user access logs. Klazify incorporates over 66 data feeds to augment the engine.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Is <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> The Best Option For Categorizing a Website?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Powerful &amp; Scalable</strong></h3>
<p>Klazify can scale to millions of requests and keep being stable under heavy workloads.</p>
<h3><strong>Easy-to-integrate</strong></h3>
<p>Customer’s time is valuable which is why Klazify’s APIs are simple to use and easy to integrate.</p>
<h3><strong>Dedicated Support Manager</strong></h3>
<p>Their Customer Support Team is always there to answer any questions.</p>
<h3><strong>Simple Documentation</strong></h3>
<p>Each endpoint is well documented with examples so a customer can quickly get started.</p>
<h2><strong>Key Features</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Big Data</strong></h3>
<p>Using advanced machine learning, <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> categorize billions of web pages, keeping the categorization database one of the most accurate in the industry.</p>
<h3><strong>Wide Range of Applications</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify’</a>s domain categorization allows customers to easily provide services such as Internet filtering, subscriber analytics, advertising networks, and fraud prevention.</p>
<h3><strong>Data Firehose</strong></h3>
<p>Need access to the raw data stream of everything as it’s being categorized? <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> provides a real-time data firehose via HTTP.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Algorithms</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify’s technology</a> categorizes content found on URLs, as well as entire websites and IP addresses, perfect for security devices that may not have access to the full URL.</p>
<h3><strong>Developer-Friendly Responses</strong></h3>
<p>Every API response is returned as JSON, which can be easily read and implemented into your product.</p>
<h3><strong>Always Up to Date</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify’s web</a> crawlers are constantly visiting and classifying new and existing websites, providing real-time results and keeping the database always up to date.</p>
<h2><strong>So what’s the difference between the other website categorization API and <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a>?</strong></h2>
<p>The difference between all the other tools and <a href="https://www.klazify.com/">Klazify</a> is that the latter is the closest thing to a real human being checking every nook and cranny of the domain you’re interested in.

<article>
      <p>Snowpack v3.0 is here! This is our biggest release yet with brand new features including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-bundled streaming imports</strong> - Import any npm package, on-demand.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated build optimizations</strong> - Built-in bundling, preloading, minification, and more.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript API</strong> - Integrate with Snowpack’s brand new native JS API.</li>
<li><strong>Node.js Runtime API</strong> - Import your Snowpack-built files directly into Node.js.</li>
<li><strong>Bug fixes, stability improvements, and a whole lot more!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Install the newest version of Snowpack to get started:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install snowpack@^3.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>Or, try out one of our updated <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-snowpack-app">Create Snowpack App</a> starter templates:</p>
<pre><code>$ npx create-snowpack-app new-project-directory --template  @snowpack/app-template-react
</code></pre>
<h2 id="reimagining-web-development-for-esm">Reimagining Web Development for ESM</h2>
<p>1 year ago, Snowpack first released with the mission to reimagine web development for modern JavaScript and ESM. Snowpack leverages modern web features to deliver a frontend build tool that needs just 50ms to start up &amp; react to new file changes, regardless of project size. In comparison, traditional web bundlers could take several seconds or even full minutes to start up in large projects.</p>
<p>Snowpack v3.0 marks another huge leap on our mission to push web development forward with the release of <strong>streaming imports</strong>. Streaming imports make it possible to import any package directly into your project, pre-built and pre-bundled for immediate use. It’s the power of the entire JavaScript ecosystem, at your fingertips.</p>
<video preload="auto" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
 <source src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/streaming-imports-demo.webm" type="video/webm">
 <source src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/streaming-imports-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h2 id="what-are-streaming-imports%3F">What are Streaming Imports?</h2>
<p>The typical web developer installs and manages their JavaScript dependencies locally using a package manager CLI like <code>npm</code>, <code>yarn</code> or <code>pnpm</code>. These npm packages can’t run directly in the browser, so additional work is needed to resolve, process, build and bundle these packages for the browser before you can actually use them.</p>
<p><strong>What if we could simplify this? What if you could skip the “npm install” step entirely and just fetch the relevant, pre-built package code on-demand via ESM import?</strong></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react@17.0.1'</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>That URL in the example above points to <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a>, a popular JavaScript CDN that we built to serve every package&nbsp;on npm as ESM. Importing dependencies by URL like this is well supported in Snowpack, Deno, and all major browsers. But writing these URLs directly into your source code isn’t ideal and makes development impossible without a network connection.</p>
<p><strong>Snowpack v3.0 brings together the best of both worlds:</strong> Get the simplicity of <code>import 'react'</code> in your own source code and let Snowpack fetch these dependencies behind the scenes, pre-built and ready to run in the browser. Snowpack caches everything for you automatically, so you can continue to work offline after the first package fetch.</p>
<p>This new workflow has several benefits over the traditional “npm install” approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Skip the install + build steps for dependencies, and load your dependencies on-demand as pre-build, pre-bundled ESM code.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> ESM packages are pre-built into JavaScript for you and never given access to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-zimmermann.pdf">run code on your machine</a>. Third-party code only ever runs sandboxed in the browser.</li>
<li><strong>Less Tooling:</strong> ESM packages are managed by Snowpack, so frontend projects that don’t need Node.js (Rails, PHP, etc.) can drop the npm CLI entirely if they choose.</li>
<li><strong>Identical Final Build:</strong> When you build your site for production, package code is transpiled with the rest of your site and tree-shaken to your exact set of imports.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is our bet on the future of web development. But if this all sounds too wild for you or you have some technical reason to keep managing your dependencies with npm, don’t worry. This is <strong>100% opt-in</strong> behavior for those who want it. By default, Snowpack will continue to pull your npm package dependencies out of your project <code>node_modules</code> directory like it always has.</p>
<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/streaming-imports">Streaming Package Imports</a> to learn more about how to enable this new behavior in your project today.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-esbuild.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="built-in-optimizations%2C-powered-by-esbuild">Built-in Optimizations, Powered by esbuild</h2>
<p><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> is a marvel: it performs 100x faster than most other popular bundlers their own benchmarks. esbuild is written in Go, a compiled language that can parallelize heavy bundling workloads where other popular bundlers – written in JavaScript – cannot.</p>
<p>Snowpack already uses esbuild internally as our default single-file builder for JavaScript, TypeScript and JSX files. Snowpack v3.0 takes this integration one step further, with a new built-in build optimization pipeline. Bundle, minify, and transpile your site for production in 1/100th of the time of other bundlers.</p>
<p>Snowpack is able to adopt esbuild today thanks to an early bet that we made on the future of bundling: <strong>bundling is just a post-build optimization.</strong> Thanks to this early design decision, esbuild can be plugged in and swapped out of your Snowpack build as easily as any other bundler.</p>
<p>esbuild is still a young project, but its future looks promising. In the meantime, we will also continue to invest in the existing bundler plugins for a long time to come, so that more mature projects can continue to use mature bundlers like Webpack &amp; Rollup.</p>
<p>To get started, check out the <code>optimize</code> option in our newest <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/optimize-and-bundle">Optimizing Your Snowpack Build</a> guide.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-jsapi.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="a-new-javascript-api">A New JavaScript API</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s new JavaScript API grants you more advanced control over Snowpack’s dev server and build pipeline, helping you build more powerful integrations on top of Snowpack to unlock new kinds of dev tooling and server-side rendering (SSR) solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit">SvelteKit</a> is the new official web app framework from the Svelte team, built with Snowpack. SvelteKit uses our new JavaScript API to manage the build pipeline and build files on-demand. Snowpack helps SvelteKit speed up development, with zero rapid updates on file change and zero upfront server start-up cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/microsite">Microsite</a> is another exciting new project built with Snowpack. Microsite is a Static Site Generator (SSG) for Preact that features automatic partial hydration, so that you send as little JavaScript down to the client as possible.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/reference/javascript-interface">JavaScript API reference</a> to start building your own custom integrations on top of Snowpack.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-runtime.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="a-new-node.js-runtime">A New Node.js Runtime</h2>
<p>Speaking of Svelte, this next feature comes directly out of our collaboration with the Svelte team. As a part of building out SvelteKit, Rich Harris created a server-side runtime for Snowpack. This runtime lets you import any Snowpack-built file directly into Node.js, handling things like ESM-&gt;CJS conversion and CSS extraction automatically.</p>
<p>The result is a unified build pipeline across both Node.js and the frontend, with all of the on-demand build performance benefits of Snowpack. Importing frontend code to run in Node.js unlocks features like true server-side rendering (SSR), test runner integrations for Jest/uvu/Mocha, and more.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/server-side-render">SSR guide</a> to get started and learn more about all of the different ways that you can connect to your Snowpack build.</p>
<p>🥳</p>
<h2 id="snowpack%E2%80%99s-one-year-anniversary">Snowpack’s One Year Anniversary</h2>
<p>Last week marked Snowpack’s one-year anniversary of the original v1.0.0 release. Looking back, I’m blown away by everything that’s happened since:</p>
<ul>
<li>150+ releases (from <code>v0.0.1</code>, all the way to v3.0 today)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/plugins">100+ Snowpack plugins</a> to choose from (and growing fast!)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/graphs/contributors">100+ individual contributors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/stargazers">15,000+ stars on GitHub</a></li>
<li>#1 Developer Productivity Boost Winner, <a href="https://osawards.com/javascript/2020">2020 JS Open Source Awards</a></li>
<li>#1 Highest Developer Interest, <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/build-tools/">2020 State of JS</a></li>
<li>#1 Highest Developer Satisfaction (tied), 2020 State of JS</li>
</ul>
<p>A huge thank you to everyone who has contributed code to Snowpack, and the hundreds of developers joining us on GitHub and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/snowpack">Discord</a>. This project wouldn’t exist today without you and your support. Thank you!</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b> Maison Battat, a global toy company, recently hired a uniquely qualified data science candidate in only 26 days. Phase describes how we worked with Maison Battat to build a text mining (i.e., “Natural Language Processing” or “NLP”) approach that could scan 1,000s of candidates in minutes and look for unique attributes and experiences shared by applicants and broader candidate pools alike.

    <div>

<p><a name="problem"></a>The Problem: too many candidates and poor screening options

</p><p>Most applicant screening systems are limited in how they enable searching and filtering of candidates. This means that they rarely allow you to include unique combinations of skills or score candidate profiles in a more flexible manner.

</p><p>Worse still, many job applications have <i>hundreds</i> or <i>thousands</i> of applicants. If you expand this to a passive pool, you can be looking at 10,000+ candidates for a single role. Hiring managers and recruiters struggle with reviewing so many profiles, and resort to keyword searches.

</p><p><a name="solution"></a>Our Solution: use recent advances in text mining to make candidate searches descriptive and holistic

</p><p>To address the challenge above, Phase uses two strategies to solve this problem.

</p><p><b>1. Make the search a conversational process</b>

</p><p>Rather than simply providing keywords, we ask recruiters to use a freeform description of the candidate they are looking for. To use the Battat example above...

</p><center>
<div><p>
A conventional exact-match keyword search might look like:</p><p>&nbsp;

“<span>Python</span>”, “<span>SQL</span>”, “<span>analyst</span>”, “<span>engineer</span>” or “<span>toys</span>”
</p><p>&nbsp;
But through our search, the candidate is described as:
</p><p>&nbsp;
“A <span>data scientist</span> who has with experience with
 <span>toys</span>, <span>education</span>, or <span>children’s products</span>.”
</p></div>
</center>

<p>We use descriptions because our search understands concepts and ideas. The algorithm knows that a “<span>data scientist</span>” is a person that is likely to know languages like “<span>Python</span>”, “<span>SQL</span>”, or others and takes on roles such as an “<span>analyst</span>” or “<span>engineer</span>”. By teaching the algorithm to seek out candidates who have experience with “<span>toys</span>”, “<span>education</span>” and “<span>children’s products</span>”, we can find people with relevant experience in related areas like “gaming” or “youth development”.

</p><p>Another way to think about this interface is that the recruiter simply has to <i>write</i> an answer to the question, “What sort of candidate are you looking for?” You need not worry about the specific structure of your response, or fitting keywords into specific parts of a search form. The above example could easily be “A former toy designer interested in analytics” or “A multilingual French-speaker who can design products and analyze data.”

</p><p>Our goal is to give the algorithm an idea of what type of candidate to look for. It will identify and make connections between concepts to find the strongest candidates. It is not limited by specific keywords. This means that a recruiter or hiring manager saves time by automating searches, while generating a broader diversity of qualified candidates.

</p><p><b>2. Search the whole resume, not just skills lists or keywords</b>

</p><p>Our semantic approach makes it easier for us to scan an entire resume to understand the person as a whole. For instance, a candidate might outline an interest in “children’s products” in one part of their resume, but not include this in their core skillsets elsewhere. This semantic approach tracks the <i>entire</i> resume and scores the <i>themes</i> that come up rather than just individual skills or keyword flags.

</p><p>Maison Battat is a family-owned toy company that encourages kids to be bold, curious, and playful. For over 45 years, they have offered a range of engaging toys for babies, toddlers, and young children including Driven™ tough trucks to dolls of Our Generation™.

</p><p>Battat wanted to hire a unique candidate with experience in marketing, e-commerce, data science and analytics. They sought out someone who was a self-starter, fast learner, proficient in another language, has lived abroad, and shares their passion for improving the lives of children through play and education.

</p><p>Our text mining approach above was used to analyze over 1,000 data science candidate profiles. The top result was Sogra, a bilingual data analyst with international experience. Importantly, she was the ultimate self-starter having created an award-winning smart toy while she was working at a toy startup.

</p><p>Sogra was the first and only candidate interviewed – she was perfect for the role. Not only was the role filled in 26 days, but both employer and employee were thrilled with the significantly easier process and speedy approach.

		<article>
			<p>Every useful process goes through at least one iteration of pulling data into scope, transforming the data, and pushing that data into another scope.<sup id="fnref:process" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:process">1</a></sup>  Consider <code>grep</code>: it reads a line from <code>stdin</code>, examines the line to see if it should be forwarded to <code>stdout</code>, and repeats until <code>stdin</code> is exhausted.  Conversely, <code>cat</code> isn’t independently useful; it only exists to forward the filesystem into another process, which may simply be our terminal.</p>

<p>In almost every case, the transformation of a useful process is <strong>reductive</strong>; it emits less than it consumes.  When a process has a larger volume of output than input, it’s generally providing a different (and ostensibly more useful) representation of its input.  Examples of this include <code>gunzip</code> and a program which, given a seed value, emits a neverending stream of pseudorandom numbers; both are only useful when placed upstream of another process.</p>

<p>For sufficiently small inputs, this might be useful on its own.  We can uncompress a small gzipped file and read it in the terminal, or swap the delimiters in a small CSV file for HTML tags and look at it in the browser.  But few datasets are intrinsically small; if we’re able to take in our data at a glance today, we shouldn’t expect to be so lucky tomorrow.</p>

<p>This reduction of our input data isn’t arbitrary; we are distilling it down to its meaning, in context.  If we’re concerned on the errors in our logs, we lose nothing by filtering out everything else.  If we’re concerned with the number of errors day-over-day, we lose nothing by reducing each log file down to a single number.  This is the essence of <strong>interpretation</strong>, as defined within the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics">semiotics</a>: the transformation of one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics)">sign</a> to a related sign, which often exists within a different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_system">system</a> of signs.</p>

<p>Our colloquial understanding of interpretation captures most of this; we are assigning meaning to something.  This process is subjective, and largely arbitrary; we are free to assign whatever meaning we like.  There are often multiple useful interpretations, and we can consider them together to better understand what we’re interpreting.</p>

<p>Semiotics also tells us that each meaning is itself just another sign, which can be interpreted in turn.  This idea, called <em>unlimited semiosis</em> in modern semiotics, was considered very unintuitive when it was first suggested in the 19th century by Charles Peirce.  In the context of software, however, it’s self-evident: each function interprets its inputs, yielding a result that can be interpreted by other functions, and so on.  There is no obvious or necessary end to this process; at some point we simply share our results with the outside world, allowing someone else to continue the chain of interpretation.</p>

<p>Meaning is created by combining software and data.  Data, by itself, is inert.  Software, by itself, is only a method for interpretation.  Software interprets data, but the converse is also true.  Different inputs will take different paths, and yield different meanings; our software is interpreted by the data it’s given.</p>

<p>This inverted perspective is useful when we look at how pieces of software are combined to create a whole.  When one function calls another, it is interpreting the purpose of the function it calls.  It is assigning meaning, in context.</p>

<p>Consider this expression, which removes all the bad values from a sequence of values:<sup id="fnref:clojure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:clojure">2</a></sup></p>



<p>The <code>remove</code> function, on its own, is highly abstract; it treats all possible predicates and all possible sequences as interchangeable.  By calling it with a specific predicate, we have made it more concrete.  As we further compose upstream, and the meaning of <code>s</code> becomes more defined, so too does the meaning of our expression.  If we think <code>(remove bad? ...)</code> lends itself to multiple interpretations, by multiple sequences, we might even give it a name:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>good</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>partial</span><span> </span><span>remove</span><span> </span><span>bad?</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we compose functions, our program’s interpretation of its input becomes increasingly abstract; by filtering out <code>bad?</code> values, we treat any interleaving of those values as if they were the same.</p>

<p>Not every function, however, makes an equal contribution to this growing abstraction; <code>remove</code> is just a different idiom for <code>filter</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>remove</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>complement</span><span> </span><span>predicate</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>s</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Likewise, <code>complement</code> just negates a function’s return value, turning <code>false</code> to <code>true</code> and vice-versa.  These functions do not assign meaning, they attempt to preserve it in a different form.  Rather than interpreting, they are <strong>translating</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course, any semiotician will tell you that <a href="https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/titles/umberto-eco/mouse-or-rat/9781780226279/">translation isn’t easy</a>, and some meaning is invariably lost along the way.  But these strata in our codebases, which attempt to translate rather than interpret, are qualitatively different; they are what we call “glue code.”</p>

<p>This, however, only defers the act of interpretation to a higher strata.  Our code exists to be interpreted, either by data or by other code composed atop it.  We leave room for interpretation using two fundamental mechanisms: function references and conditional execution.</p>

<p>Both of these mechanisms allow a function’s inputs to influence its execution.  Consider this implementation of <code>filter</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>empty?</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span> 
    </span><span>[]</span><span>
    
    </span><span>(</span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>))</span><span> 
    </span><span>(</span><span>cons</span><span> 
      </span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span> 
      </span><span>(</span><span>recur</span><span> </span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>rest</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>))))</span><span>
      
    </span><span>:else</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>recur</span><span> </span><span>predicate</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>rest</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>First we check if the sequence is empty; if so, we return an empty sequence.  If it isn’t empty, we check if the first element satisfies the <code>predicate</code>; if so, we prepend it onto the result of filtering the rest of the sequence.  Otherwise, we omit the element from our result.</p>

<p>The first clause is simple conditional execution; given an empty sequence, <code>filter</code> will short-circuit.  The second clause is both a function reference and conditional execution; <code>filter</code> will call whatever <code>predicate</code> we’ve provided, and use the returned result to choose one of two branches.</p>

<p>But these are implementation details; the person calling <code>filter</code> should be able to focus on its semantics, not the precise way it uses its inputs.  As implementors, first we decide what sorts of interpretations our function will allow, and then we determine what minimal set of inputs will allow those interpretations.</p>

<p>In the above implementation, for instance, we don’t wrap each recursion in Clojure’s <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/laziness.html#benefits-of-lazy-sequences"><code>lazy-seq</code></a> macro, meaning the entire filtered sequence is eagerly computed.  If we had made it lazy, that would allow for the code atop <code>filter</code> to have more control over where and when each element of the inputs sequence is processed.  Alternately, if we wanted to remain eager, we could have exposed a way for the code invoking <code>filter</code> to control what sort of collection it constructed, rather than always returning a <code>cons</code>-based list.</p>

<p>A broader range of possible interpretations isn’t necessarily better; simplicity has its own benefits.  If we’re happy discarding our code tomorrow, we can focus entirely on our needs today.  If we want our code to survive a bit longer, however, or even be a general-purpose library, we need to be more expansive.</p>

<p>In general-purpose code, we should rely on function references wherever possible.  In addition to the first-class functions that are common in Clojure, these encompass any object instance with one or more associated methods.<sup id="fnref:closures" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:closures">3</a></sup>. Function references provide an <strong>open</strong> mechanism for interpretation; to extend the set of possible interpretations, you just have to write your own function.</p>

<p>Conditional execution, conversely, is a <strong>closed</strong> mechanism; to extend the set of possible interpretations we need to edit a preexisting function.  In general-purpose code, this is almost always driven by some sort of open classifier function, which reduces all possible values down to a finite set of categories.  In Java, for instance, <code>equals</code>, <code>compareTo</code>, and <code>hashCode</code> reduce their inputs down to 2, 3, and 2<sup>32</sup> categories, respectively.</p>

<p>In some cases, general-purpose code may also have conditional execution based on internal datatypes.  The semantics of a red-black tree, for instance, are entirely driven by an externally provided ordering function, but its internal bookkeeping will have <a href="http://matt.might.net/papers/germane2014deletion.pdf">lots</a> of <code>if</code>s or <code>match</code>es dealing with red and black nodes.</p>

<p>If your code has conditional execution based on public datatypes, however, it’s not meant to be general purpose; it’s what we call “business logic.”  This is the upper strata of our application, interpreted by data rather than other code.  Here, the closed nature of conditional execution is useful; we can understand the meaning of a given input by looking at a single point in our codebase.  What endpoints does our API offer?  Just look at the file where all of the routes are defined.</p>

<p>Almost anyone who writes software for a living can tell the difference between glue code, library code, and business logic.  The first time we heard each term, it was fairly clear from context and the names themselves what was being described.  If someone doesn’t understand, we assume they’ll figure it out soon, just like we did.</p>

<p>We may have a solid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge">tacit understanding</a> of these concepts, but would struggle to explain them, and how they relate to each other.  Semiotics seems to provide a framework that can formalize and correlate this knowledge.  Put another way, I believe every skilled software designer has an innate, mostly undeveloped talent for applied semiotics, and I’m curious what would happen if they tried to develop it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don’t think simply reading <a href="https://iupress.org/9780253202178/a-theory-of-semiotics/">a seminal text on semiotics</a> will suffice; the interpretation done by software is vastly more reductive than that done by humans.  When we use the idea of library to denote a book, or vice-versa, the amount of detail in our mental conception changes very little, if at all.  In many contexts, they will have very similar connotations.  But in a computer, a library-sized dataset is not an abstract symbol of knowledge; it’s a library’s worth of data, which is not at all the same as …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>“Let me know how I can be helpful.”</strong></p><p>This phrase has become something of a <a href="https://vcstarterkit.substack.com/p/in-defense-of-let-me-know-how-i-can">caricature of itself</a> among VCs, right up there with Patagonia vests and coffee meetings at The Creamery.</p><p>The good news is that, despite the jokes, most investors I've spoken with seem to really mean it (and yes, vests really <em>are </em>a<em> </em>practical choice in SF).</p><p>So even though the phrase has become a bit of a meme, I <em>actually am</em> interested in understanding who has been helpful over time.</p><p>Personal chemistry matters a lot in any relationship, but in choosing which investors to work with, I like to couple that kind of qualitative information with important quantitive data as well. In other words, I want to know whom I get along with as well as who's helping out in the ways they've said they would.</p><p><strong>In this article, I’ll share with you my specific workflows for keeping track of key moments in relationship building</strong> so that you’ll always have confidence about where things stand with current and potential investors.</p><h2>My process</h2><p>The approach is simple. I record key moments in each relationship, like when an investor makes a customer intro, refers a potential candidate, or helps out in some other way.</p><p>By keeping track of those moments over time, I can take an objective look at how we're working together in light of these specific actions—who's delivering on offers to make intros? who's providing meaningful input?</p><p>I've found that this kind of data couples nicely with the more implicit qualitative aspects of the relationship.</p><p>So what tool is right for managing all this?</p><p>On the surface, this may seem like a job for a CRM, but I've found that <strong>traditional CRMs don’t work for this.</strong></p><p>I’ve tried loads of them, and have always found the experience lacking. They’re usually premised on stages of a pipeline and expected deal value, and are more interested in <em>leads</em> and <em>accounts</em> than individuals.</p><p>Orbit, on the other hand, is based on the <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model">Orbit Model</a> and on <strong><em>activities</em></strong> — who’s doing what, and when did they do it?</p><p><strong>It turns out this is the perfect data model for understanding how a relationship grows over time. </strong>That’s why I’ve been using Orbit as my personal CRM.</p><p>The result? Rich context on the people in my orbit, as well as a way to quickly see how different folks are engaging (or not), and how:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/f282ac371e18c25a3c5dc6c81ffb3da02441e81d-2604x940.png" alt="Screenshot of the Orbit Members Table" title="Orbit Members Table Example"></p><h2>Key ideas</h2><p>Before getting into the workflows, let’s cover two important concepts in Orbit: Members and Activities.</p><p>A <strong>Member</strong> is a person added to your Orbit workspace: manually, via an integration, or via API. Each member has a profile page where you can see lots of data about that member as well as a timeline of activities they’ve done, content they’ve created, and more.</p><p><strong>Activities</strong> are things a member does, like mentioning you on Twitter, attending an event, meeting with you, or, as in this case, doing things like making intros, or anything else you want to keep track of.</p><p>Activities will appear chronologically on a member’s profile, as well as in a global stream for your entire workspace.</p><p>The combo of members + activities tells you who’s doing what, when they did it, and where.</p><blockquote>For more on how we use Orbit to build Orbit, <a href="https://orbit.love/blog/how-we-use-orbit-to-build-orbit/">check out this article</a>.</blockquote><h2>Tracking social mentions as activities</h2><p>Activities are added to your workspace manually or via an integration.</p><p>Orbit offers several <a href="https://orbit.love/integrations/">integrations</a> that add members and activities to your workspace automatically. Some are better for companies or large communities, e.g. our GitHub and Discourse integrations.</p><p><strong>For individuals, the Twitter integration is really handy</strong>. It automatically aggregates mentions and follows of your account, as well as any keywords you’d like to track.</p><p>This can be helpful for general relationship building, but also for understanding which VCs are engaging on social by following you, mentioning you in relevant conversations, and sharing your content.</p><p>Here’s my personal workspace timeline showing Twitter activity alongside the custom activities we'll discuss below:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/0266d1a17d14ba1742960a30bfebbf5cd81e14e1-1040x1050.png" alt="Screenshot of the Orbit Activity Feed" title="Orbit Activity Feed"></p><p>Any time an investor follows or mentions me, I add a tag to their profile to designate them as an investor:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/4749c8f7f9eaa1747d92266247112829ccddcd78-518x282.gif" alt="Animation of adding a tag to a member profile in Orbit" title="Orbit Tag Demo"></p><p>Tags are great because you can sort and filter views and reports based on tags. For example, you can filter the Members table by the investor tag to see only investors, or filter the Activity feed by the same tag to see only activities from folks with that tag.</p><h2>Tracking specific investor activities</h2><p>In addition to automated activity tracking from integrations and the API, you can also manually add activities.</p><p>Manual work isn’t ideal, and we try hard to reduce data entry as much as possible, but for some things, like high-value non-recurring activities, it’s unavoidable.</p><p><strong>I keep track of a few different activities across my investor relationships:</strong></p><ul><li>Customer intros made</li><li>Candidate intros made</li><li>Meetings (these aren’t necessarily helpful, but I still like to have context)</li></ul><p>Here’s a timeline of an investor who’s made two helpful intros:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/b8246312af0ebccbe765e8e93b02d19f21bd60c7-1999x826.png" alt="Screenshot showing an Orbit member prpofile" title="Profile of an investor"></p><p>Adding activities is pretty fast. The title is the only thing required, though I usually include relevant context in the description field, and define an “activity type.” In the screenshot above, the activity types are <em>meeting</em> and <em>intro</em>.</p><p>In addition to tags, activity type is another way to filter and sort, as we’ll see later.</p><p>You can track literally anything you want, so feel free to get creative beyond my examples here.</p><h2>Adding notes</h2><p>Sometimes you want to add context to a profile that’s not necessarily associated with an activity. In those cases, you’d just add the content to a note:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/cad465e65d62216810cfdc56604384d20ff0cb14-1426x452.png" alt="Screenshot showing a note on the Orbit timeline. The note says: &quot;REDACTED has always been super responsive to investor updates, which is much appreciated, as well as responsive to texts and c…&quot;" title="Note detail view"></p><p>Even better, Orbit indexes the text of your notes, so you can find them later via Search.</p><h2>The impact of tracking relationship growth</h2><p>Now that you’ve spent the time to track all your key relationship moments, you can sort your investors by Love, which illustrates their engagement over time, and Reach, which is a function of their Twitter followers:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/f282ac371e18c25a3c5dc6c81ffb3da02441e81d-2604x940.png" alt="Screenshot of the Orbit Members Table" title="Orbit Members Table Example"></p><p>Remember Activity Types from earlier? You can sort this table (and other views) by those types. For example, <strong>it’s trivial for me to see a list of folks who’ve made intros</strong>:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/a508809009b04327cff53fc61a00fd7496471e3d-1999x436.png" alt="Screenshot of the Filter UI" title="Filtering activity types"></p><p>You can also use Search to build complex queries, like investors who have done 10+ activities who live in New York, or folks who have made customer intros who also follow me on Twitter.</p><p>The use case for search depends greatly on your situation, but suffice it to say that, as you add data to Orbit over time, the data—and your ability to find it—becomes increasingly powerful.</p><h2>Bonus section: charts!</h2><p>Reporting is probably less important for your personal use case than for a company’s, but that doesn’t mean they’re not fun to look at! If you've been using activity types consistently, Orbit can show you your trend of key activities over time, whether that's intros, meetings, or whatever's important.</p><p>Here’s an example of Activities by Type from the main Orbit workspace:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/91833ac69a61f25e41bf575c60cabbed6aa46348-1999x1070.png" alt="Screenshot of a chart showing activities over time" title="Activities chart"></p><p>We also track Twitter follows and mentions:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/6d7904ad2eb11c3ecc6f932307d46a4022d315a1-1999x976.png" alt="Screenshot showing Chart of Twitter activity" title="Chart of Twitter activity"></p><h2>Who actually has been helpful?</h2><p>So what are the outcomes of all this? For one, you’ll have loads of context about current and potential investors to help you better build and navigate those relationships.</p><p><strong>You’ll also have a clear record of how different folks have tangibly worked to impact your business.</strong> By the time you’re ready to raise your next round, you’ll be able to rely on more than just gut feeling or promises made.</p><p>Investor relationships last many years, so I think it’s worth spending a little time early on to track these key moments in service of helping you make better decisions about your long-term partners.</p><p><strong>Want to try this? </strong>Shoot me a DM on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickjwoods">@patrickjwoods</a> with your email address and a note about what you’re working on, and I’ll send over setup info. Good luck!</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>I use <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV Rack</a> a lot. I normally use it on Windows as running VSTs in Linux is still a bit of a PITA and If I’m going to make music I want to have access to all of my tools. However, I still want to be able to use VCV on Linux for processing guitar when taking breaks from working on other things without having to reboot over to Windows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for a good while now VCV has had an annoying bug. I’m not sure when the bug first appeared, but at some point it started eating my GPU. Like, absolutely wrecking it.</p>
<p><img src="https://opguides.info/VCVfail.png" alt=""></p>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/clbr/radeontop">Radeontop (GitHub)</a>
</p>
<p>It was still technically usable, in fact it ran butter smooth…</p>
<p><img src="https://opguides.info/fps.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh wait, I wonder if killing <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom">picom</a>, the X11 compositor I use will help</p>
<p><img src="https://opguides.info/nocomp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Nopeeee.</p>
<p>Alright, obviously this is far from ideal. I actually only knew to check the FPS because of an interesting quirk, I think when the FPS got this high my GPU was getting jobs at that rate, so 930ish times per second, but still finishing them quickly enough to cause the GPU load to constantly change going 100% â†’ 0% â†’ 100% â†’ 0% … in a loop, really fast. It caused the physical GPU, an AMD Vega56, to whine in my tower. I don’t <em>think</em> it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetically_induced_acoustic_noise">coil whine</a>, but it was also very loud and sounded similar.</p>
<p>First I tried just changing the FPS target value in VCV and then I tried playing with settings in the <code>settings-v1.json</code> file, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>My next attempt to fix it was to try rebooting and loading my system with the Zen Linux kernel as I knew it used a different scheduler and did some extra stuff for real time computation (nice to have anyway when doing audio stuff like VCV).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was a bust. Still rocking the 930 FPS.</p>
<p>From here I had to ask for more help. Thankfully, a friend in my modular music chat on telegram was able to point me to a few ideas. I ran <code>glxinfo</code>, made sure everything looked sane, and it was. Next I tried using <code>LIBGL_THROTTLE_REFRESH=1</code> and <code>WGL_SWAP_INTERVAL=1</code> with no luck either.</p>
<p>Failing other ideas I Googled “linux limit frame rate environment variables” and one of the top results was <a href="https://gitlab.com/torkel104/libstrangle">libstrangle (GitLab)</a> which limits frame rate by using <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to dynamically link it’s own library that does the FPS limiting. This reeks of hacky bullshit. But I’m <em>always</em> down for some hacky bullshit. For S&amp;Gs I check, and `lo and behold it’s in the AUR.</p>
<p><img src="https://opguides.info/strangle.png" alt="strangle"></p>
<p>I still have no idea what’s going on. The easy guess is “You have a Vega56, it’s a weird GPU with HBM2” and, yeah, that makes sense, but then there’s <a href="https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues/1829">This Issue</a> in VCV Rack’s GitHub repo where someone else is having the same problem on an Nvidia card on Ubuntu. I’m using an AMD Card on Arch! Other than the commonality of Linux, these systems couldn’t be much more different.</p>
<p>That issue shows the original poster had traced it down to <a href="https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/blob/e334902e8addf96ad726192c665d806f0952def0/src/window.cpp#L415">one line</a>, but I’m hesitant to accept that explanation when VCV works fine for me on Windows and the issue has no other comments from other people with the same issue.</p>
<p>prior to this fix, VCV could outright lockup my entire system as my GPU screamed bloody murder, but it got me thinking- while VCV is by far the most violent I’ve seen this issue get, I think I’ve seen it elsewhere, and yep:</p>
<p><img src="https://opguides.info/nuklearfps.png" alt="nuklearfps"></p>
<p>This is the example project for <a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a>, “A single-header ANSI C immediate mode cross-platform GUI library”, exhibiting the same issue. I’m curious how many projects based on Nuklear this affects.</p>
<p>LibStrangle again works to fix this, but without it my graphic card still makes an annoying whine, a whine that I don’t get under even very high load when gaming.</p>
<p>I won’t include anymore FPS screenshots, but I get the exact same behavior in <a href="https://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/">Radium</a>, a neat tracker-like Digital Audio Workstation.</p>
<p>I suspect there are many, many more. I’m not going to go checking every program on my system, but I found this behavior weird enough to be worth documenting.</p>

	<p><span>Editor’s note: This is part one of a short series. You can find <a href="http://amattn.com/p/elixir_phoenix_the_business_case_for_liveview_strong_enough_to_change_how_you_staff_your_dev_team.html">part two</a> here. <span></span></span></p>

<p>I’ve spent the last month and change working on a <a href="https://habit.show/">little side project</a>.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about this one is that it’s written completely in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>.  This is a post about my experience doing so.</p>

<p>Elixir is a language that came out of the heyday of Ruby on Rails about a decade ago.  It was originally billed as “Ruby on the Erlang VM”, trying to blend the best of both worlds.  Spoiler, I believe it has largely succeeded.</p>

<p>It’s still got quite a bit of Ruby influence, but overall, it’s much more functional.  You will see maps, filters and reduce’s all over your code base.</p>

<p>From the Erlang side of the family, you’ll see a lot. There’s no mutability.  Variables cannot be changed, you can only create new ones from combining or transforming existing.  Pattern Matching is everywhere and it’s still quite powerful.  You can trivially call down to Erlang primitives whenever you need to.</p>

<p>The Ruby influence is more in style and syntactic sugar.  You’ll see your <code>def</code>’s and <code>end</code>’s and <code>-&gt;</code>’s.  You can skip parenthesis around function arguments if it doesn’t introduce ambiguity.  There’s no early return, you always return the last expression.  Map and list syntax will be fairly familiar.  The @ prefix denotes attributes / decorators.  Atons.</p>

<p>It’s got some quirks.  The native list primitive is a classic linked list, not an array.  This means that prepend is cheap, but count, insert, append is expensive.  It also means you can do head/tail car/cdr operations quite easily.  Keyword lists as a weird list/map hybrid.</p>

<h2>Digging into the pipe operator</h2>

<p><a name="b1"></a>
The <code>|&gt;</code> operation is a particularly good example.  To most newcomers, it’s a weird, inscrutable symbol whose operation isn’t easily intuited.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>  Yet once you get used to it, there’s quite a bit of elegance to it, and even historical reference to the pipe operation in the shell.</p>

<p>For those new to the language it works like this:  take the input of the pipe operation (x below) and pass it as the first argument of the target function of the pipe operator.</p>

<pre><code>x
|&gt; function(y, z)
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>function(x, y, z)
</code></pre>

<p>The elegance comes from chaining these together like so;</p>

<pre><code>x
|&gt; function(y, z)
|&gt; other_function(a, b)
|&gt; yet_another_function(c)
</code></pre>

<p>If this is the last expression in a function you return the results of the final <code>yet_another_function</code></p>

<p>You can also bind it to a variable like so:</p>

<pre><code>final_output =
  x
  |&gt; function(y, z)
  |&gt; other_function(a, b)
  |&gt; yet_another_function(c)
</code></pre>

<p>The pipe metaphor breaks down as you start with x, do a ton of transformation on it and your eyes have to scan way back to the beginning to see what variable you are assigning the final results to.</p>

<p>It kind of micro-example of the entire macro-experience of using Elixir:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s quirky</li>
<li>There’s a learning curve</li>
<li>Taking the time to climb that curve can result in elegant solutions</li>
<li>The endgame is high developer efficiency</li>
</ul>

<h2>An actual example</h2>

<p>To see an actual code snippet with pipes in action:</p>

<pre><code>collected_errors =
  Date.range(start_date, yesterday)
  |&gt; Enum.to_list()
  |&gt; Enum.filter(fn _ -&gt;
    random_number = :rand.uniform(100)
    random_number &lt; 75
  end)
  |&gt; Enum.map(fn date -&gt;
    make_map_of_attrs(date, user, some_bool, some_int)
  end)
  |&gt; Enum.reduce([], fn entity_attr, all_errors -&gt;
    case create_entity_with_attr(entity_attr) do
       {:ok, _entity} -&gt;
         all_errors
       {:error, err_msg} -&gt;
         [err_msg | all_errors]
    end
  end)
</code></pre>

<p>If the above looks like moon runes, it’s probably just because the syntax is new to your eyes.  After a week or so with the language, it reads very clearly.  Walking thru that snippet, we start with the second line:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a date range between two dates (a range is essentially an entity with a start and end.)</li>
<li>Take that range and convert it into a linked list, filling in all the dates inbetween</li>
<li>Throw away about 25% of the dates, randomly</li>
<li>For each date, create a struct (map) which contains kv pairs of data, including the date.<br>

<ul>
<li>The output of this is a list of maps which gets passed on</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take that list of maps and create defined structs.  Typically a <code>create_</code> prefix means you are creating and object and often storing it in some persistence layer.<br>

<ul>
<li>If no error occurred during the create statement, just pass along the error accumulator unmodified.</li>
<li>Any errors that do occure get prepended into the <code>all_errors</code> accumulator during the reduce operation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finally we put the result of the reduce operation (any accumulated errors) and bind that to the <code>collected_errors</code> variable.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The endgame is high developer efficiency</h2>

<p>I’m very, very fond of go, but a typical implementation of equivalent functionality would typically be <strong>at least 5x longer and certainly more irritating to write.</strong></p>

<p>So, back to that macro experience of using Elixir:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s quirky</li>
<li>There’s a learning curve</li>
<li>Taking the time to climb that curve can result in elegant solutions</li>
<li>The endgame is high developer efficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>That last bullet point, in my relatively short experience with Elixir, I’m fairly certain the overall developer productivity is quite high.  Likely in the top quartile or better of all development environments (possibly even top 10%).  There are <a href="https://smartlogic.io/podcast/elixir-wizards/s5e5-vo/">others who think so as well</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>combination</em> of the last two bullets is what I refer to as sublime efficiency in the title of this post.  This is a rare combination.  I believe go to be a great language for “IDE to prod” developer productivity, but I don’t believe it is a particularly elegant language.  Lisp and it’s variants can be quite elegant but you will run into feature velocity problems at some point (deployment, ecosystem, hiring…).</p>

<p>Developing in a modern functional language, with great safeguards (pattern matching, guards, type annotations, strong testing libraries, etc.) somehow allows developers to be efficient, write elegant code and also achieve high feature velocity.</p>

<p><a name="b2"></a>
It’s clearly not a perfect language or ecosystem.  The deployment story is not as good as go.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>But it is one that I could see a lot of companies using as a competitive advantage with respect to time to market of getting product out.</p>

<p>All you have to do is get over the learning curve.</p>

<p>Footnotes:</p>

<ol>
<li><a name="1"></a>OCaml and F# have a similar operator and predate Elixir. The creator of Elixir himself thinks it <a href="https://elixirforum.com/t/which-language-first-introduced-the-pipe-operator/16791/8">came from F#</a>.<a href="#b1">↩</a></li>
<li><a name="2"></a>To be fair, no language ecosystem has a deployment story as good as go.  I would put elixir above any other dynamic language like python, ruby.  Being dependent on the erlang VM, it’s more like deploying a Java app (if you squint).  The tooling is <a href="https://amattn.com/p/deploying_elixir_phoenix_webapps_to_the_cloud_with_releases.html">there</a> and actively getting better.<a href="#b2">↩</a></li>

January 14, 2021 | https://thingsthatkeepmeupatnight.dev/posts/golang-http-handler-errors/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thingsthatkeepmeupatnight.dev/posts/golang-http-handler-errors/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>Every so often, go’s error handling pops up in various forums and everyone seems
to have an opinion about it. Some say they should be more like throwable
exceptions, others prefer sum types like rust’s <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. While I’ve gone
with the sum type <a href="https://dev.to/duunitori/mimicing-rust-s-result-type-in-typescript-3pn1">approach in typescript</a>,
I still like the way go handles errors.</p>
<p>That said, figuring out how to <em>really</em> handle errors can take some time (with
or without sum types/exceptions). In this post, I’ll be walking through one
approach on handling errors in go’s <code>http.Handler</code>.</p>

<p>The error values can be frustrating if you expect them to scale out “just like
that” without repeating themselves. Usual example goes something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>func</span> copyfile(src, dst) <span>error</span> {
	fsrc, err := os.Open(src)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> err
	}
	<span>defer</span> fsrc.Close()

	fdst, err := os.Open(src)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>return</span> err
	}
	<span>defer</span> fdst.Close()

	err := io.Copy(fdst, fsrc)

	<span>return</span> err
}
</code></pre></div><p>Thats not so bad, and I’m quite sure that most of you have seen example like
that before. But let’s take a look at similar situation that might occur in a
<code>http.Hanlder</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>func</span> handleThing(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	<span>// Our path is something like /thing/3
</span><span></span>	id, err := idFromPath(r.URL.Path)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		http.Error(w, http.StatusText(http.StatusBadRequest), http.StatusNotFound)
		<span>return</span>
	}

	thing, err := store.GetThingByID(id)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// The error might be sql.NoRows, or it might be something else.
</span><span></span>		<span>if</span> store.IsNotFoundErr(err) {
			http.Error(w, http.StatusText(http.StatusNotFound), http.StatusNotFound)
			<span>return</span>
		}
		log.Printf(<span>"Failed to get a thing: %v"</span>, err)
		http.Error(w, http.StatusText(http.StatusInternalServerError), http.StatusInternalServerError)
		<span>return</span>
	}

	acc := AccountFromRequest(r)
	<span>if</span> acc == <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// No account attached to the request's session -&gt; permission denied.
</span><span></span>		http.Error(w, http.StatusText(http.StatusForbidden), http.StatusForbidden)
		<span>return</span>
	}

	has, err := thing.HasPermissionToView(acc)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// For some reason, we failed to check permissions. Better log it.
</span><span></span>		log.Printf(<span>"Failed to check permissions: %v"</span>, err)
		http.Error(w, http.StatusText(http.StatusInternalServerError), http.StatusInternalServerError)
		<span>return</span>
	}

	<span>if</span> !has {
		<span>// Permission denied.
</span><span></span>		http.Error(w, http.StatusText(http.StatusForbidden), http.StatusForbidden)
		<span>return</span>
	}

	<span>// All good, send data to the client.
</span><span></span>	respond(w, r, decodeThing(thing))
}
</code></pre></div><p>Theres some functions that you’ll have to imagine is defined somewhere, but the
functionality is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract ID from URL</li>
<li>Use that ID to get the thing from database</li>
<li>Check if the client has permission to view the thing</li>
<li>Give the thing to the client</li>
</ul>
<p>This functionality probably repeats itself for other resource types, so it gets
repetitive quite fast. Imagine doing the same for resources like foo, bar,
account and so on! Same functionality can be written in Django like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> handle_thing(request):
    id = id_or_bad_request(request)
    thing = thing_or_404(id)

    account = account_or_forbidden(request)

    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> thing.has_permission(account):
        <span>raise</span> Forbidden()

    <span>return</span> JsonResponse(...)
</code></pre></div><p>Now that’s quite a lot simpler, thanks to throwable errors and how they
can be used to disrupt the code’s flow. <code>id_or_bad_request</code>, <code>thing_or_404</code> and
<code>account_or_forbidden</code> all throw an error that someone catches somewhere higher
and does the appropriate thing, like respond with correct status code and log
any errors.</p>

<p>Keeping that python code in mind, let’s think what we could do in our go code to
get it a bit more terse:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an error occurs, we just want to “throw” it somewhere. It usually is a
client error, but not always. Perhaps someone else can figure that out?</li>
<li>If a non client error occurs, it needs to be logged somewhere</li>
<li>Someone else should be able figure out the <code>http.Error</code> calls</li>
</ul>
<p>Golang’s <a href="https://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go">error handling and Go</a>
talks a bit about error handling in your http handlers and gives the following
example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>func</span> viewRecord(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) <span>error</span> {
    c := appengine.NewContext(r)
    key := datastore.NewKey(c, <span>"Record"</span>, r.FormValue(<span>"id"</span>), 0, <span>nil</span>)
    record := new(Record)
    <span>if</span> err := datastore.Get(c, key, record); err != <span>nil</span> {
        <span>return</span> err
    }
    <span>return</span> viewTemplate.Execute(w, record)
}

<span>// NOTE: the following is my adapted version from the example's ServeHTTP to a
</span><span>// middleware/wrapper
</span><span></span>
<span>type</span> HandlerE = <span>func</span>(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) <span>error</span>

<span>func</span> WithError(h HandlerE) http.HandlerFunc {
	<span>return</span> <span>func</span>(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		<span>if</span> err := h(w, r); err != <span>nil</span> {
			http.Error(w, err.Error(), 500)
		}
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>That already solves one of our problems, which is the <code>http.Error</code> call. But
sometimes we don’t want to expose detailed errors to the client, so I would
replace the actual message with just a generic internal server error message.
Also, logging the reasons for internal server errors is important, so that you
can figure out what went wrong.</p>

<p>We want to return an error from our <em>actual</em> <code>http.Handler</code>, but somehow
instruct the <code>WithError</code> wrapper function to respond correctly to the client
when it gets an error, and on some errors log the errors. Something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>func</span> WithError(h HandlerE) http.HandlerFunc {
	<span>return</span> <span>func</span>(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		<span>if</span> err := h(w, r); err != <span>nil</span> {

			<span>if</span> is404err(err) {
				http.Error(w, <span>"not found"</span>, 404)
				<span>return</span>
			}

			<span>if</span> isBadRequest(err) {
				http.Error(w, <span>"bad request"</span>, 400)
				<span>return</span>
			}

			<span>// Some other special cases...
</span><span></span>			<span>// ...
</span><span></span>
			log.Printf(<span>"Something went wrong: %v"</span>, err)

			http.Error(w, <span>"Internal server error"</span>, 500)
		}
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>Hmm, those “other special” cases might come and go and might get quite specific
for some handlers. Also, we’d still need to write those <code>is404err</code> and
<code>isBadRequest</code> handlers and whatever will follow. We can do much better with an
interface:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>type</span> ErrorResponder <span>interface</span> {
    <span>// RespondError writes an error message to w. If it doesn't know what to
</span><span></span>    <span>// respond, it returns false.
</span><span></span>	RespondError(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) <span>bool</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>With this interface we can do quite powerful things. Our <code>WithError</code> turns into
this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">
func WithError(h HandlerE) http.HandlerFunc {
	return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		if err := h(w, r); err != nil {
			if er, ok := err.(ErrorResponder); ok {
				if er.RespondError(w, r) {
					return
				}
			}

			log.Printf("Something went wrong: %v", err)

			http.Error(w, "Internal server error", 500)
		}

</code></pre></div><p>Notice how our special cases just disappeared? They are now just another
implementation(s) of <code>ErrorResponder</code>. This is what would our <code>Not found</code> and <code>Bad request</code> errors now looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang">
<span>// BadRequest error responds with bad request status code, and optionally with
</span><span>// a json body.
</span><span></span><span>type</span> BadRequestError <span>struct</span> {
	err  <span>error</span>
	body <span>interface</span>{}

<span>func</span> BadRequest(err <span>error</span>) *BadRequestError {

}

<span>func</span> BadRequestWithBody(body <span>interface</span>{}) *BadRequestError {

</code></pre></div><p>You could easily write more <code>ErrorResponder</code>s for permission denied errors and
much more.</p>

<p>With <code>ErrorResponder</code> and <code>WithError</code>, we can reduce our earlier <code>handleThing</code>
handler into this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>func</span> handleThing(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) <span>error</span> {
	<span>// Our path is something like /thing/3
</span><span></span>	id, err := idFromPath(r.URL.Path)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// Literally bad request. We could use BadRequestWithBody to
</span><span></span>		<span>// respond with a fancy information for the client.
</span><span></span>		<span>return</span> BadRequest(err)
	}

	thing, err := store.GetThingByID(id)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// Likely a not found issue, but something else might have gone wrong.
</span><span></span>		<span>// Maybe404Error handles both cases.
</span><span></span>		<span>return</span> Maybe404(err)
	}

	acc := AccountFromRequest(r)
	<span>if</span> acc == <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// No account attached to the request. Client needs to authenticate.
</span><span></span>		<span>return</span> AuthenticationRequired()
	}

	has, err := thing.HasPermissionToView(acc)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// Something actually went wrong. Error will be logged and 500 message
</span><span></span>		<span>// sent to the client.
</span><span></span>		<span>return</span> err
	}

	<span>if</span> !has {
		<span>// Client doesn't have permission to view this resource.
</span><span></span>		<span>return</span> PermissionDenied()
	}

	<span>// All good, send data to the client.
</span><span></span>	respond(w, r, decodeThing(thing))
}

<span>func</span> main() {
	...
	mux.Handle(<span>"/thing/"</span>, WithError(handleThing))
	...
}
</code></pre></div><p>Thats a lot better! I’ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to combine the
auth and permission checking. Another exercise is to do a bit better logging
than just “Something went wrong: <em>error</em>” in the WithError function. Perhaps log
the path and requester, or use trace ids?</p>
<p>With all this, we can now:</p>
<ul>
<li>“throw” errors somewhere</li>
<li>Someone else is figuring out the <code>http.Error</code> calls</li>
<li>Non client errors are logged</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes I’m amazed just by how simple (yet powerful) go’s error type is. Other
times I’m banging my head against the wall because I can’t figure out how to use
that simplicity. The solution presented in …</p></div></div>

      <p><span>When Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston first began accepting applications for their new startup accelerator, they had $200,000 in seed money and four employees.</span></p>
<p><span>Graham, who had been working at a web application company called Viaweb, wasn’t particularly confident that their new venture would do well. But Graham wanted to invest in promising college students building innovative tech startups, much like his mentor, lawyer Julian Weber, had invested $10,000 in Graham’s own Viaweb.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Despite their misgivings, Graham and Livingston plowed ahead, creating a Silicon Valley icon in the process. To date, Y Combinator has helped launch and fund over 2,000 startups in Silicon Valley, including giants like Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Reddit, DoorDash, Coinbase, and many more. As of 2021, the combined value of YC’s startups is estimated at $300 billion. Today, founders still aspire to get into one of YC’s batches.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Y Combinator’s consistently successful 16-year run all started with that First Batch, which included founders like Alexis Ohanian, Steve Huffman, Sam Altman, and Justin Kan. Last week, Kan </span><a href="https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1337122637483364354?s=20"><span>tweeted an image</span></a><span> of YC’s First Batch dating back to the summer of 2005. It’s worth seeing how the years have treated that very first batch.</span></p>
<h2><b>2. Zak Stone</b></h2>
<p><b><img alt="" height="393" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/.thumbnails/zak_stone.jpg/zak_stone-700x393.jpg" width="700"><span></span></b></p>
<p><b>Co-founder, Memamp<br></b><b>Where is he now?<br></b><b>Product manager for Cloud TPUs, Google</b></p>
<p><span>Along with Chris Slowe, Zak Stone co-founded Memamp, a desktop search startup. The two had been working on their idea for about a year before being accepted into Y Combinator’s First Batch, but it wasn’t meant to be. That summer, Google released its own desktop search feature, and Apple announced its Spotlight search feature for Macs. While Stone and Slowe decided to scrap the idea, Slowe joined up with Reddit’s founders. Stone, meanwhile, now works for Google’s Brain Team as a product manager for Cloud TPUs.</span></p>
<h2><span>3. Steve Huffman<br></span><span>4. Alexis Ohanian<br></span><span>6. Chris Slowe<br></span><span>10. Aaron Swartz</span></h2>
<p><span><img alt="" height="393" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/.thumbnails/reddit.jpg/reddit-700x393.jpg" width="700"><span></span></span></p>
<p><b>Founders, Reddit<br></b><b>Where are they now?<br></b><b>Ohanian: Entrepreneur, investor<br></b><b>Huffman: CEO, Reddit<br></b><b>Slowe: CTO, Reddit<br></b><b>Swartz: Committed suicide in 2013 at age 26.</b></p>
<p>After the initial rejection of their first startup idea, MyMobileMenu, Alexis Ohanian and his fellow founders started work on “the front page of the internet.” That project,&nbsp;an idea that came from Paul Graham,&nbsp;turned into Reddit, one of Y Combinator’s most successful startups. When it was bought by Condé Nast in 2006, Ohanian was suddenly a multi-millionaire and one of Silicon Valley’s most revered founders, all by age 23. Since co-founding Reddit, Ohanian has founded several other startups and venture capital firms, including Breadpig, Hipmunk, Das Kapital Capital, and Initialized Capital. His wife, tennis superstar Serena Williams, also founded her own VC firm, Serena Ventures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Steve Huffman, Reddit’s second co-founder, served as CEO of the company until 2009, then returned to the role in 2015. Although Huffman and Ohanian sold Reddit for $10 million to $20 million, Huffman later said that he regretted the decision, not realizing how popular the site would become. As of 2019, the company was worth $3 billion. Huffman went on to co-found Hipmunk, a travel search site, before returning to the startup that started it all.</span></p>
<p><span>Chris Slowe is still with Reddit as its CTO (and is a former CEO), but spent some years away from the company before returning in 2015. Slowe also worked for Hipmunk as chief scientist, citing the desire for change as his main reason for leaving Reddit.</span></p>
<p><span>Reddit’s fourth co-founder, Aaron Swartz, arrived late to the party when his own startup, Infogami, merged with the company. Later on, Swartz devoted his time to a number of social causes, helping launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee to support online activism. He also founded the online group Demand Progress which led a campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act in 2010.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2011, Swartz was arrested on breaking-and-entering charges on the MIT campus after illegally downloading academic articles from a university database. He was charged in federal court with two counts of wire fraud, among other charges, and faced 35 years in prison. Days after a rejected plea bargain and counter offer to minimize his sentence, Swartz was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment by apparent suicide. He was 26 years old.</span></p>
<h2><b>5. Emmett Shear<br></b><b><b>11. Justin Kan</b></b></h2>
<p><b><b><img alt="" height="420" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/.thumbnails/justin_kan_emmett_shear.jpg/justin_kan_emmett_shear-700x420.jpg" width="700"><span></span></b></b></p>
<p><b>Founders, Kiko<br></b><b><b>Where are they now?<br></b></b><b><b>Shear: CEO, Twitch<br></b></b><b><b>Kan: CEO of shuttered startup Atrium</b></b></p>
<p><span>Justin Kan and Emmett Shear have found massive success since first signing up for Y Combinator’s first class. The founders sold their online calendar startup, Kiko, a year after graduating YC, when they realized the new Google Calendar would eclipse their own startup. Kan and Shear went on to found Justin.tv, a livestream site that Kan himself used to document his daily life for eight months. The two then founded livestream gaming site Twitch as a spin-off of Justin.tv, which has grown into a $15 billion business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>8. Philip Yuen</span></h2>
<h3><strong><img alt="" height="420" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/.thumbnails/philip_yuen-2.jpg/philip_yuen-2-700x420.jpg" width="700"><span></span></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Founder, TextPayMe<br>Where is he now?<br>CEO, Aurabeat Technology</strong></h3>
<h2><b><b>13. Mikhail Ledvich</b></b></h2>
<p><b><b><img alt="" height="420" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/.thumbnails/mikhail_ledvich-2.jpg/mikhail_ledvich-2-700x420.jpg" width="700"><span></span></b></b></p>
<p><b>Founders, Clickfacts<br></b><b>Where is he now?<br></b><b></b><strong>VP, Senior Digital Product Consultant, Bank of America</strong></p>
<p><span>Clickfacts, one of the lesser known startups to come out of Y Combinator, was a malware software solutions company. After YC, its co-founders continued running their startup until its demise sometime after 2012. Although it didn’t generate much buzz while it was up and running, Clickfacts became the longest running startup from YC’s First Batch not to be acquired. Mikhail Ledvich, who was also a product architect at Clickfacts, today works for Bank of America as a VP and senior digital product consultant.</span></p>
<h2><b>14. Sam Altman<br></b><b><b>Not pictured: Nick Sivo&nbsp;</b></b></h2>
<p><b><b><img alt="" height="420" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/.thumbnails/sam_altman_nick_sivo.jpg/sam_altman_nick_sivo-700x420.jpg" width="700"><span></span></b></b></p>
<p><b>Founders, Loopt<br></b><b>Where are they now?<br></b><b>Altman: CEO, OpenAI<br></b><b>Sivo: Runs YC Hacker News</b></p>
<p><span>After Loopt failed to gain traction in the years following its run with Y Combinator, Sam Altman and Nick Sivo sold their startup in 2012. Since then, Altman has kept close ties with YC, first becoming a part-time partner, then president of the startup accelerator in 2014. Altman is also CEO of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research startup he co-founded with Elon Musk. Nick Sivo has also spent his post-Loopt years at Y Combinator, maintaining their Hacker News site, though he’s largely stayed out of the public eye.</span></p>
<h2><b><b>15. Jesse Tov</b></b></h2>
<p><b><b><img alt="" height="420" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/.thumbnails/jesse_tov-2.jpg/jesse_tov-2-700x420.jpg" width="700"><span></span></b></b></p>
<p><b>Founder, Simmery Axe<br></b><b>Where is he now?<br></b><b></b><strong>Computer Science Professor at Northwestern University</strong></p>
<p><span>Like some of the other startups to come from Y Combinator’s First Batch, Simmary Axe shut down not long after the summer program ended. Its founder, Jesse Tov, hasn’t spent much time as an entrepreneur since, trading the startup life for academia. He now teaches computer science at Northwestern University. Before teaching, Tov spent time with the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center.</span></p>
<h2><b>1. Jessica Livingston<br></b><b>16. <b>Paul Graham</b></b></h2>
<p><b><b><img alt="" height="393" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/.thumbnails/jessica-livingston-and-paul-graham.jpg/jessica-livingston-and-paul-graham-700x393.jpg" width="700"><span></span></b></b></p>
<p><b>Founders, Y Combinator<br></b><b>Where are they now?<br></b><b>Both Graham and Livingston still run Y Combinator.</b></p>
<p><span>As for Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston, the husband and wife duo&nbsp;have ceased running the startup accelerator day to day, and now have&nbsp;a full-time staff. Graham, who stepped down in 2014, has been called a “startup guru” for the major companies&nbsp;that have come out of YC. In recent years, Graham has authored numerous essays on startups and company growth, becoming one of the greatest minds behind Silicon Valley in the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Livingston also had a hands-on role in the early days of Y Combinator. Before getting married in 2008, Graham and Livingston were dating while running YC, and according to Graham, the program felt like a family. Today, Livingston is on sabbatical, but lives with Graham and their two children in England.</span></p>
<p><em>Note: the names of&nbsp;founders 7, 9, and 12 aren't known, and their startups aren't listed on the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/?batch=S05">Y Combinator page</a> for the First Batch.</em></p>

Removing bundling during dev through JIT transpilations of files in a dedicated server allowed these projects to offer an incredible fast feedback loop while developing without losing the state of art optimizations like bundling and minification for production builds.</p><p>The release of <a href="https://github.com/preactjs/wmr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WMR</a> from the Preact team solidified this path and brought new ideas to the table. In particular, their universal plugin format based on rollup plugins let them and other devs share the same transform code in dev and build time. Vite 2 continues this exploration, incorporating what is proving to work well in Snowpack and WMR and taking the opportunity to apply what has been learned in the past months.</p><p>All of these tools are framework agnostic, you can use Vite to develop React with fast refresh for example. But, interestingly, the teams behind Vue, Preact, and Svelte are at the forefront of this new generation of dev tools. Vite is being developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evan You</a> and the Vue community, WMR is an effort from the Preact ecosystem and the Svelte guild will surely get more involved in Snowpack dev now that they have chosen it for <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Svelte Kit</a>. I think this marks an inflection point for UI frameworks, and we will see a lot of innovation in DX, SSR, and SSG in the future.</p><h2 id="powered-by-vitepress"> Powered by VitePress</h2><p><a href="https://patak.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This page</a> is built using <a href="https://vitepress.vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VitepPress</a>, which now uses Vite 2. It is a great way to experience the developing flow that Vite unlocks. VitePress is a Vue-powered static site generator that is pushing the boundaries in both DX and performance. Because of the use of templates in Vue, static blocks can be detected to avoid hydration penalties. Dynamic Vue components can still be interleaved in markdown.</p><p>The post is converted into a vue component so the composition API can be used to add reactive state to your documents. Components can also be imported and used in the markdown. VitePress is still able to identify the static parts of the post and only include the minimal code needed to hydrate the dynamic blocks.</p><div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>setup</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>

It is possible because you see the results of your changes instantly. If you need to wait even a few seconds when changing the values, it can't work. The same idea applies to Vite. It enables us to craft our apps or pages with a tight feedback loop. We see the result of our changes immediately, and it opens the door to workflows that were not possible before.</p><h2 id="what-is-new-in-vite-2"> What is new in Vite 2</h2><p>You can check <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/1207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the discussion</a> that Evan started with the rationale for this next iteration.

From Vite's source docs:</p><blockquote><p>Vite plugins support a subset of Rollup plugin API with a few extra vite-specific options. A valid vite plugin is also a valid Rollup plugin. On the contrary, a Rollup plugin may or may NOT be a valid vite universal plugin, since some Rollup features do not make sense in an unbundled dev server context. That said, as long as a rollup plugin doesn't have strong coupling between its bundle phase and output phase hooks then it should just work (that means, most of them). By default, the plugins are run during both serve and build. When a plugin is applied during serve, it will only run <strong>non output plugin hooks</strong> (see rollup type definition of <a href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#build-hooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rollup Plugin Hooks</a>). You can think of the dev server as only running <code>const bundle = rollup.rollup()</code> but never calling <code>bundle.generate()</code>.</p></blockquote><p>This new plugin format allows Vite to reuse a log of plugins from the rollup ecosystem and also share more code with WMR. I am maintaining a list of Vite compatible official rollup plugins at <a href="https://vite-rollup-plugins.patak.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vite Rollup Plugins</a>.</p><h3 id="error-overlay"> Error overlay</h3><p>Following other tools, Vite will now display an error overlay in the browser when there is a compiler error or failed resolve in the code.

This allows for more of a relationship between aesthetics and functionality.</span></p><p id="viewer-5v8m5"><span>The most common type of Solar Glass is <strong>T</strong><strong>hin-film modules</strong> (e.g. amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride) which<!-- --> been around for a few years. They can be designed into the fabric of a building and can perform in conditions/locations where crystalline silicon panels (conventional solar panels) cannot. </span></p><p id="viewer-e6r4b"><span>This solar glass has a varying efficiency that depends on it's<!-- --> opacity which it's self varies between 50% transparent and fully opaque.

There are several options when it comes to renewable energy: <!-- -->Wind, Hydro, Tidal, Geothermal, Biomass and of course Solar energy.</span></p><p id="viewer-4befc"><span>Sunlight is one of our planet’s most abundant and freely available energy resources. The amount of solar energy that reaches the earth’s surface in one hour is more than the planet’s total energy requirements for a whole year so trying to harness that energy seems obvious.</span></p><p id="viewer-etkau"><span>Up until now, <!-- -->crystalline silicon Solar Panels have accounted <!-- -->opacity which it's self varies between 50% transparent and fully opaque.

Born from research at MIT and Michigan State University, founded on the principle of seamlessly integrating solar technology into everyday products and surfaces. They have since developed a transparent solar coating that integrates into standard windows, with endless possibilities for future applications.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-enp20"><span>Physee</span></h3><p id="viewer-1n23a"><span>The European manufacturer <a href="https://www.physee.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Physee</u></a> was actually the first to install transparent solar panels. The company developed a technology they call the "Power Bar" which is small solar panels that are installed along the window pane edges to generate power.</span></p><p id="viewer-dihln"><span>Physee is also working on <!-- -->power generating glass coating. It directs sunlight onto integrated solar cells in PowerWindows. Without impacting the transparency of its glass, windows will produce the same energy as 1/5 of a solar panel placed on a building's roof.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-dc5n2"><span>Bottom Line</span></h2><p id="viewer-igh5"><span>The bottom line is that, although this technology is not yet widely available and still in it's early stages, Solar Glass seems like a very promising new way to generate electricity from the sun.

Initially you will learn how to create a simulation with Flower and in the second part distribute the simulation to multiple machines. In the third part of this series you will learn how to run each Federated Learning client on a single dedicated machine and configure Flower so that you can scale to far more clients. In each subsequent part we will build upon the previous code.</p><blockquote><p>Federated Learning brings together people from a diverse set of backgrounds. Building FL systems requires expertise in machine learning, distributed systems, software engineering, and operations, to name just a few.

Beutel</a></p></blockquote><p>At the end of this series we aim to show that, although Federated Learning is challenging to implement, Flower can make it easy to start with an idea, simulate it, and then gradually evolve it to bring it into production.</p><h2>Series</h2><ul><li><strong>Part 1: Single-Machine Simulation of Federated Learning Systems</strong></li><li>Part 2: Multi-Machine Simulation of Federated Learning Systems (coming soon)</li><li>Part 3: Evolving Workloads From Simulation Towards Production (coming soon)</li></ul><h2>Single-Machine Simulation</h2><p>What do we mean when we say simulate the Federated Learning process? Let us start with a quote from Wikipedia.</p><blockquote><p>A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time. Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing.
– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote><p>When we talk about a simulation with Flower we mean running an entire Federated Learning system (one server and multiple clients) on a single machine. Real-world Federated Learning systems (e.g., on mobile devices) have characteristics that are not present in simulation (e.g., connectivity issues), but well-crafted simulations are often a good starting point when developing a new system.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>Our simulation will run one Federated Learning server and ten clients. We will write the code in such a way that we can increase the number of clients at a later point. All the code is available in the Flower repository in the <a href="https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/simulation">examples directory</a>.</p><p>Our simulation will start the server as well as all clients using sub-processes of our main process. The main process will block until each of these processes exits. For the purpose of the simulation we are also going to create our own partitioned dataset.</p><h2>Dataset</h2><p>Federated Learning solves the problem of learning a model over multiple datasets. For research purposes, we often use an existing dataset and artificially split it into multiple partitions. This simulation uses CIFAR-10 and partitions it into as many partitions as there are clients in our simulation. All the code related to this is in its own Python module named <code>dataset.py</code>.</p><p>To get started we import <code>tensorflow</code>, <code>numpy</code>, and <code>flwr</code> and define some types that are going to be used in the signatures of our functions.</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>from</span><span> typing </span><span>import</span><span> List, Tuple, cast

We customize two strategy parameters: the number of clients we expect to be connected before the training starts and the fraction of connected clients that are sampled during each round.</p><p>An Example: We want to sample 50 out of 100 clients. To do this we have to wait until 100 clients are connected, which we do by setting <code>min_available_clients</code> to <code>100</code>.

    <h5>Posted on January 13, 2021 by Olivier Goffart and Simon Hausmann</h5>
    
  <p>
    With <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/">SixtyFPS</a>, we are creating a GUI toolkit. We chose
    Rust as the implementation language for our runtime library, and we want to make the same library usable from different
    programming languages. We believe programmers in all languages need to build GUIs - powered by the same runtime library.
    Rust, with its Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is an excellent choice.<br> In
    this article we look at how to expose an idiomatic C++ API from our Rust library.
  </p>

<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>

    <p>Initially we chose to start with support for three languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rust</b>: Because it's our implementation language.</li>
        <li><b>C++</b>: It's a low level language that we're familiar with, and is still one of the most established languages
            in the embedded device space.</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript / TypeScript</b>: Because it's a very popular dynamic language.</li>
    </ul>


    <p><img src="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/expose-rust-library-to-other-languages/diagrams.png"></p><p>The Rust library (also known as a crate) is split into two parts, the shared implementation crate and a thin idiomatic
        API crate.
    </p>
    <p>For JavaScript we use <a href="https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon">Neon</a> to expose an API. Neon enables us
        to conveniently write JavaScript APIs and create an NPM package.</p>
    <p>The C++ part is a bit more challenging.</p>

<h3 id="expose-idiomatic-cpp-api-through-ffi">Expose an Idiomatic C++ API through Rust FFI</h3>

    <p>We decided to keep the C++ API only in the header files. This is because, unlike with Rust, there's
        no widely adopted C++ equivalent of Cargo, to help with downloading and building dependencies. If we want to ship
        binaries, then we have to maintain ABI compatibility, which is difficult in C++.<br> This way, we can also keep the
        C++ binding as lightweight as possible: for performance and memory footprint.
    </p>
    
    <p>Rust cannot expose a C++ API: structures can only be exported using a C representation (<code>#[repr(C)]</code>) and
        <code>extern "C"</code> functions. This means that we cannot expose Rust features like traits, generics, or
        destructors even if they have a C++ equivalent.
     </p>
     
    <p>The Rust ecosystem provides a few helper crates to make the job easier:</p>
     <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen"><b>cbindgen</b></a>: This helper crate automatically generates C/C++
            header files based on the <code>repr(C)</code> structure and the <code>extern "C"</code> functions. We use
            cbindgen to generate internal header files only. It's very helpful to avoid manually writing some unsafe error-prone
            boilerplate. 
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mystor/rust-cpp">The <b>cpp</b> crate</a>: This
            helper crate is useful when calling C++ libraries from Rust, and we make use of that. However it is not suitable for
            exposing a C++ API from Rust. (Note: Olivier Goffart happens to be the maintainer.)
        </li>
                
        <li><a href="https://cxx.rs/">The <b>cxx</b> crate</a>: This would be a safer way than cbindgen to ensure that the
            interface between C++ and Rust is correct. While it could be useful, cbindgen already get us a long way. So
            we don't use it for now.
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>To build the correct shared library we use Cargo. The resulting library exports C mangled symbols. We ship
    a set of C++ header files that provide the C++ API and use the C functions behind the scenes. For convenience,
    we provide a CMake integration that ties together the library linkage and includes path setup. </p>

<h3 id="slices-vectors-strings">Slices, Vectors, and Strings</h3>

    <p>
    In FFI, passing a basic integer works out of the box. But what about more complex data types, like a 
    Rust slice or a string? Well, most classes like Rust's String, Vec, or slices are not <code>#[repr(C)]</code>,
    so we can't use them directly. While we could use these classes with an indirection, every simple call may need to go
    through a non-inline function boundary. So we would need to convert types, which means re-allocating memory.</p>
    <p>So instead of sharing code, we implemented data structures using <code>#[repr(C)]</code> and a stable ABI, so
        that they can be accessed directly from C++ and Rust, or any low-level language.</p>

   <p>For the slice we create a structure that holds a pointer and a size:</p>

<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct Slice&lt;'a, T&gt; {
    ptr: NonNull&lt;T&gt;,
    len: usize,
    phantom: PhantomData&lt;&amp;'a [T]&gt;,
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>Slice&lt;'a, T&gt;</code> can be dereferenced to <code>&amp;'a [T]</code>.
    In C++, cbindgen generates the following snippet:


</p><pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct Slice {
    T *ptr;
    uintptr_t len;
};
</code></pre>

<p>We tell cbindgen to generate that code in a <code>cbindgen_private</code> namespace, and we wrap it an interface
similar to <code>std::span</code>.</p>

<p>We use strings and vectors to pass data between the engine and the user's code. This results in
    shared ownership where we want to avoid unnecessary copying of data. Our API is property based
    with setters and getters, therefore we implement shared ownership through
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write"></a>Implicit sharing / Copy-on-write. </p>

<p><img src="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/expose-rust-library-to-other-languages/sharedvector.png"></p><pre><code>#[repr(C)]
struct SharedVectorHeader {
    refcount: atomic::AtomicIsize,
    size: usize,
    capacity: usize,
}

#[repr(C)]
pub struct SharedVector&lt;T&gt; {
    inner: NonNull&lt;SharedVectorInner&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
}


/// These functions are called from the C++ constructor
/// and destructor
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn sixtyfps_shared_vector_allocate(
    size: usize, align: usize) -&gt; *mut u8 { /*...*/ }
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn sixtyfps_shared_vector_free(
    ptr: *mut u8, size: usize, align: usize) { /*...*/ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Rust, the <code>impl Clone</code> and <code>impl Drop</code> make sure to increment
and decrement the atomic reference count and call the destructors. Similarly, in C++, we implement
copy constructor and destructor for the same purpose. Note that we still need to call the Rust
allocator function via the exposed C interface.</p>

<p>Now we can write a wrapper in C++:
(<a href="https://github.com/sixtyfpsui/sixtyfps/blob/master/api/sixtyfps-cpp/include/sixtyfps_sharedvector.h">full file</a>)
</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt; struct SharedVector {
  SharedVector() : inner(nullptr) {}

  SharedVector(const SharedVector &amp;other)
    : inner(other.inner)
  { if (inner) ++inner-&gt;refcount; }

  ~SharedVector() {
     if (inner &amp;&amp; (--inner-&gt;refcount) == 0) {
        for (auto it = begin(); it &lt; end(); ++it)
            it-&gt;~T();
        cbindgen_private::sixtyfps_shared_vector_free(
            reinterpret_cast&lt;uint8_t *&gt;(inner),
            sizeof(SharedVectorHeader)
                + inner-&gt;capacity * sizeof(T),
            alignof(SharedVectorHeader));
     }
  }
  SharedVector &amp;operator=(const SharedVector &amp;other)
  { /*...*/ }

  const T *begin() const { /* ... */ }
  const T *end() const { /* ... */ }
  void push_back(const T &amp;value) { /* ... */ }
  // ... more vector-like API

private:
  // (SharedVectorHeader is generated by cbindgen)
  cbindgen_private::SharedVectorHeader *inner;
};
</code></pre>


    <p>Right now these types, such as <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedvector">SharedVector</a> and
        <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedstring">SharedString</a>, are within the internal <code>sixtyfps-corelib</code>
        crate, and re-exported for Rust users through the public <code>sixtyfps</code> crate.  If there is demand for it, we may consider moving them into a
        smaller public crate with its own release schedule.</p>


<h3 id="destructors">Destructors</h3>

    <p>It's important to note that <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedvector">SharedVector</a> and
        <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedstring">SharedString</a> have destructors in C++.
        We can't pass instances by value in <code>extern "C"</code> functions, because the calling conventions are different
        for arguments or return types with C++ destructors; not supported by C. Therefore we can only pass them by pointer
        or reference.
    </p>

    <p>If we want to add a C++ destructor, constructor, or any member functions to types directly exported by cbindgen to our public API, 
        we use 
        <code><a href="https://docs.rs/cbindgen/0.16.0/cbindgen/struct.ExportConfig.html">cbindgen::ExportConfig</a>::body</code>:</p>

<pre><code>cbindgen_config.export.body.insert(
    "MyStruct".to_owned(),
    "    inline MyStruct(); inline ~MyStruct();".to_owned()
  );
</code></pre>

    <p>
    Then we implement <code>MyStruct::MyStruct</code> and <code>MyStruct::~MyStruct</code> in a manually
    written header file, by either doing the memory management directly or calling C helper functions
    implemented in Rust.</p>
     <p>It's important to keep in mind that anything allocated from Rust needs to be freed by Rust. 
    The same applies to allocations in C++: they might not share the same allocator.
    </p>

<h3 id="dynamic-dispatch">Dynamic Dispatch (virtual table) Across the Language Barrier</h3>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Bon_toutou.png/186px-Bon_toutou.png"></p><p>
    Let's start with the classic example of dynamic dispatch in Rust:</p>
<pre><code>pub trait Animal {
  fn speak(&amp;self, loudness: i32) -&gt; String;
}
struct Dog { name: String }
impl Animal for Dog {
  fn speak(&amp;self, loudness: i32) -&gt; String
  { "Waf!".into() }
}
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn do_something_with(
  animal: &amp;dyn Animal
) {
  println!("{}", animal.speak(1));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the above code does not work. How could we implement a class <code>Cat</code>
in C++ and call the <code>do_something_with</code> function? What if we wanted to implement
<code>do_something_with</code> in C++? The problem is that trait objects (<code>&amp;dyn</code>) are not
valid in FFI - their binary representation is not guaranteed to be stable. If we try to compile the above code,
we get this warning:</p>

<pre><code>warning: `extern` fn uses type `dyn Animal`, which is not FFI-safe
  | extern "C" fn do_something_with(animal: &amp;dyn Animal)
  |                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^ not FFI-safe
  = note: `#[warn(improper_ctypes_definitions)]` on by default
  = note: trait objects have no C equivalent</code></pre>

  <!--https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/trait-object.html-->
<p>Internally, <a href="https://brson.github.io/rust-anthology/1/all-about-trait-objects.html">we know</a> that
a trait object is composed of a pointer to the instance, and a pointer to a virtual table containing
pointers to functions. The layout of this trait object (which pointer comes first) and the layout of the virtual
table is an implementation detail of Rust. So we decided to re-implement them to work accross FFI. Instead of
writing a <code>trait Animal</code>, we write a virtual table by hand:</p>

<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct AnimalVTable {
    speak: extern "C" fn speak(
        VRef&lt;AnimalVTable&gt;, i32, &amp; mut SharedString);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, our virtual table has only one function. It is <code>#[repr(C)]</code> so that
cbindgen can generate a structure that the C++ code can access. Since we can't use <code>String</code>
we changed the return type to <code>SharedString</code>. We also pass the parameter by mutable reference instead
of just returning it, because it is not allowed to return a type that has a destructor.<br>
Instead of passing a trait object, our functions receive a pointer to the virtual table and
a …</p></div></section></div></div>

  <p>Published on Jan 13, 2020.
    </p>
  <p><em>Well, at least according to me</em></p>

<p>I recently encountered a CMake feature which I wasn’t aware of. It’s <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html">FetchContent</a>. I’m sure this is not news to most people since it was added in CMake 3.14<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and that’s been around since February of 2019, so two years now, but this feature is a revelation.</p>

<p>It can… no, it should… no, it <em>must</em> become the stepping stone for future of C and C++ package managers.</p>

<p><em>… after an issue with it is resolved, which I will talk about furhter down in the post</em></p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-fetchcontent">So, what is FetchContent?</h2>

<p>It’s pretty straight forward, actually. By using two CMake functions: <code>FetchContent_Declare</code> and <code>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</code><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> users can declare a named content item which can then be… well… fetched <em>in configure time</em>. The key here is, as opposed to <code>file(DOWNLOAD ...)</code>, this allows three important things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define the means by which the content is produced (not just source, but also types of sources)</li>
  <li>Have an identifiable name for the content</li>
  <li>Maintain the coherency of the content in a well-defined manner</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example directly from the CMake docs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>include</span><span>(</span>FetchContent<span>)</span>
<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
  googletest
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
  GIT_TAG        release-1.8.0
<span>)</span>
<span>FetchContent_Declare</span><span>(</span>
  Catch2
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
  GIT_TAG        v2.5.0
<span>)</span>

<span># After the following call, the CMake targets defined by googletest and</span>
<span># Catch2 will be defined and available to the rest of the build</span>
<span>FetchContent_MakeAvailable</span><span>(</span>googletest Catch2<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ha! <code>GIT_REPOSITORY</code>! See? See? This lets us use CMake for package management.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-my-favorite-package-manager">But what about My-Favorite-Package-Manager™?</h2>

<p>I get it. Conan, vcpkg and the many<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> others that exist are great, but they are external. Of course I’ve experimented with the popular C++ package managers, but I’ve been reluctant to actually start using one for my projects. They may have CMake integrations but they are not triggered by CMake. They try — and succeed — to be more than CMake. The thing is that, like it or not, CMake is, or at least getting really close to being, the de-facto standard build system for C++<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. CMake is terrible in many ways, but it has proven to be the best we’ve have<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So what do we get by bundling the package manager with the build system?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_package_manager">Nix</a> (which is awesome) or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/">Rust’s Cargo</a></p>

<h3 id="packages-from-source">Packages from source</h3>

<p>Oh, this package has <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>? You don’t need to download a binary when you can just fetch it and <code>add_subdirectory</code>… it<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. It will inherit everything you need from your project.</p>

<h3 id="only-the-packages-we-need">Only the packages we need</h3>

<p>Sure, you can define different packages depending on platform, <a href="https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/triplets/">triplet</a>, and other configurations from other package managers, but you’re using their language. And then you have to either reimplement the same configuration analysis in you CMake files, or use some exports from those package managers, which is not always easy. If your package manager is within CMake, you already, inevitably, have all the tools to configure your build. The information for <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.3/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER.html">the compiler</a>, the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD.html">standard</a>, the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.html">target platform</a>, the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR.html">architecture</a>, the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html">linkage</a>, and <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html">everything else</a> is already there.</p>

<h3 id="single-command-configuration">Single command configuration</h3>

<p><code>$ cmake .</code></p>

<p>…and everything works, everything is up to date, and everything is there. You are ready to build.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-use-fetchcontent-now">Can I use FetchContent now?</h2>

<p>Sort of.</p>

<p>Of course you can use the raw calls, even though they are not yet a package manager. <a href="https://github.com/adobe/lagrange/tree/72f9a5447b6803245d43a37a18b76e59c16fbda8/cmake/recipes/external">Adobe do exactly that</a>.</p>

<p>And, though the feature has been around for some time, I’m only aware of a single package manager which is built with it: <a href="https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM.cmake">CPM</a>.</p>

<p>Now, CPM is awesome and I’ve started using it in my personal projects. Everything new I make uses CPM and I’ve migrated some old stuff, too. However it’s not a mature and complete package manager. It can’t error on package version inconsistencies (though it can detect them) and it’s not built to handle binary packages. Source only. That, however, might be the thing you need. It is enough for most of my needs. I wholeheartedly recommend it for personal and/or small projects.</p>

<p>But!</p>

<p>There is a huge problem. Not with CPM, but with FetchContent itself. FetchContent can’t be <strong>the</strong> API package managers are built upon today.</p>

<p>This problem is performance. FetchContent is just too slow to be used for a serious load. It’s not an unfixable problem, but as far as I understand the issue, it will most likely have to be reimplemented. Here’s a table with me experimentig on different machines containing roughly<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> how much time it takes to run FetchContent per content item, or package. <a href="https://github.com/iboB/cmake-fetch-content-perf/blob/82ee13918550f18bbf22bd3bf38c721a7de9fb80/CMakeLists.txt">Here’s the CMakeLists.txt</a> I used. Note that these times are not from fetching the packages. They are from a “noop” run. One which identifies that everything is up to date, and does nothing.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>OS</th>
      <th>CMake Version</th>
      <th>Generator</th>
      <th>Machine</th>
      <th>~ ms per item</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Ubuntu 20.04</td>
      <td>3.16.3</td>
      <td>Unix Makefiles</td>
      <td>ThreadRipper, SSD</td>
      <td>200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Arch Linux</td>
      <td>3.19.2</td>
      <td>Unix Makefiles</td>
      <td>8 core @ 2.4 GHz, HDD</td>
      <td>800</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Windows 10</td>
      <td>3.19.2</td>
      <td>Visual Studio 2019</td>
      <td>ThreadRipper, SSD</td>
      <td>1200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Windows 10</td>
      <td>3.19.2</td>
      <td>MinGW Makefiles</td>
      <td>ThreadRipper, SSD</td>
      <td>1200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Windows 10</td>
      <td>3.16.3</td>
      <td>MinGW Makefiles</td>
      <td>6 core @ 3 GHz, SSD</td>
      <td>1500</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>That’s at <em>configure time</em>, so every time the CMake scripts are touched, it will get executed. As you can see even the best time of roughly 200 ms per item is pretty bad, but the Windows times of over 1 second are abysmal. It’s simply prohibitive for a project with hundreds or even tens of dependencies to spend 1 second per dependency only to confirm that it’s up to date.</p>

<p>I opened <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21703">an issue on CMake’s tracker</a><sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> about that, and hopefully it will get addressed in some way. I even have some ideas of how this can be addressed from the outside, just with CMake user code, but I hope it won’t come to this.</p>

<p>I truly believe that this is the future of C++ package management. If the preformance issue is fixed (or worked around), I think in several years C++ package management will be based on FetchContent. Whether CPM will become <em>the</em> new de-facto standard or some other not-yet-written software, I can’t tell, but this is it! I can feel it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Over the last several years and during my time at Atlassian, I’ve been lucky enough to learn from hundreds of engineering teams about their current development practices, their origins, and where they strive to be from an engineering perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Culturally, one of the most common themes for each organization was moving towards some form of a DevOps model. I also noticed that the majority of organizations I spoke to were on a slightly different journey or maturity level in terms of how they’d adopted or planned to adopt DevOps. A lot of where they were today was based on the roots of where they started off as an organization. For that reason, it’s important we know a little bit about the history of how we’ve made it to our cloud-native world as it is today.&nbsp;</p><p>We can define the evolution of the internet over the past few decades as three different “acts”. Act one, two, and three. Within each act there’s a gradual evolution of the internet and how engineering teams operated their applications during each one of them.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><h4><strong>Act 1: Early to mid 90s and the rise of dot com&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>‍</p><p><strong>A quick history:&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>This was the early years of the internet where available bandwidth was still lacking, and the complexity of software increased at a rate faster than the ability of hardware to handle it. It was critical for businesses to figure out a way to get apps on multiple PCs without filling up too much space, while also providing the ability to access from anywhere. The best way to do that was to host the data on someone else's computer, or what was then called a Data Center.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Example companies:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>America Online (AOL)&nbsp;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd1d1ab54430e6b747263b2/60006e395cf1b9d84db3da56_ApLCwUOIagCmUTUDXIQfIsqeqBT5OnmO2Kz-QO5PN4T0KlBdoZjYZcIpUHxUIjpi58dUDLmyOw2OyNrW1SjAi_Miv02YFTfn8tkghYy3v3iHGTCugcz2YJWUiOOBQAfJQJUWUzQH.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Operations model:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Engineering cycles were extremely long as there were still three siloed roles which consisted of development, operations, and QA in order to move applications through the software development lifecycle and into production. Every single one of these applications were deployed into a dedicated data center which would be monitored by operations teams who were familiar with the systems if anything went wrong.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Act 2: Late 90s, early 2000s and the rise of internet hyper-growth superstars&nbsp;</strong><br></h4><p>‍</p><p><strong>A quick history:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>With Salesforce.com, Amazon, and Google leading the way, the internet and SaaS started becoming a bit more mainstream and new business models began emerging. These faster moving, hyper-growth companies started adopting hints of what we see in today's modern DevOps and agile development practices.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Example companies:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Amazon, Google, &amp; Salesforce.com&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd1d1ab54430e6b747263b2/60006e39f9b70cd79a632237_NfQnOJ-5BsRD-H3x28P0flYVHdnpdrK8WzHrhKcBkcsGw_5o7I5Age043Ri0ZKozBgsJ9aZZ9cI41E4d9Fs8fHeirJzIwHSAUnlj6-oLhHS94qWaDwvQc63lVdr-whsWole0i_KV.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Operations model:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Applications were still deployed and monitored in their own very large data centers, although because of the massive scale and growth of some of these companies, it made sense to build out a central infrastructure team that could manage common issues dependent on any services. This is also when Site Reliability Engineer and Systems Engineer roles were eventually born.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Act 3: The 2010s, beginnings of cloud-native, and high-availability cloud</strong><br></h4><p>‍</p><p><strong>A quick history:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>During this era, internet and SaaS applications are developed on top of one of the big three public cloud providers: AWS, GCP, or Azure. The emergence of cloud-native in this era also came with more competition, so building faster, scalable, and resilient applications that contributed directly to business growth was key. Also for many of these organizations, the introduction of Kubernetes would create huge efficiency gains like reclaiming any unused capacity during off-peak hours and reducing build times.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Example companies:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Airbnb, Box, Pinterest&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd1d1ab54430e6b747263b2/60006e3af711dc73a4a0cda4_aKhuOhookGB842E7yMFRgIvc1HrJyV0Ev2T49W0B1UxVqhtgVRa499CifCBcuf1zn4yreok1jafe-0fTNac9Srqw67Vj5AJesB9BhhGKx9bGxRdMGf87XP5Ysc087mTjJ9r_4pFw.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Operations model:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Software iterations happen at lightning speeds, and getting product in the hands of customers as fast as possible is the priority. The technology that comes out of the box from the big three public cloud providers allows for much more flexibility and freedom for the organizations born during this ‘act’. Act 3 marked the transition away from dedicated operations teams focused solely on making sure infrastructure was still running services, especially earlier on in the company's growth stages. Now, resources can be poured into engineers who can handle both development and operations -- leading to what we now call a “You build it, you run it” model.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Why DevOps works today and what to keep in mind&nbsp;</strong><br></h4><p>The big three public cloud providers have not only lowered barriers for start-ups, but they’ve also provided an amazing foundational infrastructure for any size company to build on. It’s really helped tear down the walls between development and operations, because with it your infrastructure starts to look a lot like software too. Engineers can much more easily understand the API driven nature, and their infrastructure starts to look a lot like code -- which is exactly what they’re used to.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Now that engineers are even closer to what’s going on in their infrastructure, operations more naturally comes as part of the day-to-day. Most of the rudimentary operational tasks we’ve experienced in Act 1 &amp; 2 have been automated to a point where now you can both own it, all while shipping product faster. While some may think that the move to cloud-native will make the traditional operations engineer obsolete, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Even with all the latest advancements in infrastructure, the engineers who focus on operations and reliability still have critical roles and skill sets needed during different stages of a scaling organization.&nbsp;<br></p><p>All in all, if you’re wondering what’s the right model for your organization -- the answer is it really depends. Depending on the size, scale, growth or what makes sense for the engineering organization some may go the way of the site reliability or systems engineering model. For many companies, the right way might be a pure DevOps, “you build it, you run it” model built on the public cloud, taking into account the number of engineers, reliability/SLO’s required, and how fast the team needs to iterate and ship code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>What doesn’t change though is the need to ship code as fast, confidently, and reliably as possible. Whichever model you choose the dynamics and ecosystem for engineering teams is becoming extremely complex. All the moving pieces around your infrastructure, services, metadata, components, ownership, teams, deploys, on-call schedules, incidents etc. occupies a level of mindshare in the back of every engineer’s head. We need to set that free. effx helps the world’s best engineering teams do that -- <a href="https://www.effx.com/"><strong>you should take it for a spin here for free.</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

Since then, it's become a cult classic,&nbsp;and they&nbsp;still get&nbsp;requests from people who want to watch it.</p>  <p>"Some people are just hearing it for the first time and they're looking for copies," Carol Anne Johnson told CBC Radio's <em>Mainstreet</em>. "It's all over Cape Breton and the mainland and whoever wants to hear their language really appreciates it, especially if they're away from home."</p>  <p>The family has passed out many copies on&nbsp;DVD&nbsp;over the years, and even heard of kids watching it so many times they wore out their copies.</p>  <p>"Parents were coming up to us and saying, 'You know, my child is speaking Mi'kmaw ... They're watching<em> Chicken Run</em> all day. They're watching it on repeat and they're starting to speak Mi'kmaw,'" said Tom Johnson.</p>  <p><em><strong>LISTEN | Carol Anne and Tom Johnson explain their overdub of Chicken Run:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Eskasoni family overdubs Chicken Run in Mi'kmaw"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/48/947/InfoMorn_CapeBreton_640x360.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Information Morning - Cape Breton</span><span>8:12</span><span>Eskasoni family overdubs Chicken Run in Mi'kmaw</span></p></div></div></div><span>Remember the kids movie Chicken Run?  We look into a particularly Cape Breton phenomenon: Chicken Run, overdubbed in Mi'kmaw.  Reporter Holly Conners spoke to Tom and Carol Anne Johnson about how their family overdubbed the blockbuster to expose young people in Eskasoni, and beyond, to the Mi'kmaq language.<!-- --> <!-- -->8:12</span></span></span></p>  <p>Tom voices one of the main characters, a rooster named Rocky,&nbsp;who falls in love with Ginger&nbsp;the hen, voiced by Carol Anne.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Carol Anne said that people will often remark on their voices when they see the couple on the street.</p>  <p>"People stop us and say, 'Oh my God&nbsp; .... all I can hear is Rocky,'" Carol Anne laughed. "And of course, [Tom will] stop and he'll do his Rocky voice."</p>    <h2>Preserving a language</h2>  <p>Tom grew up speaking Mi'kmaw&nbsp;and he worries about&nbsp;the future of the language. He said the number of speakers in Eskasoni alone has dropped drastically since the 1980s.</p>  <p>Still, he said there's a lot of work being done to try to keep the oral language alive. He points to the efforts of staff at the Eskasoni&nbsp;Immersion School and a&nbsp;YouTube channel he created&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MikmaqMusic/featured" target="_blank">to share Mi'kmaw music.</a></p>  <p>"This was something that was never seen before," Tom&nbsp;said.&nbsp;"You have these animated characters speaking the language and it sparked interest amongst the younger generation."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Carol Anne said the family reached out to Dreamworks, the studio that owns the rights to the film,&nbsp;asking for permission several years ago, but they never heard back. She figures that's a good sign.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | A scene in Chicken Run overdubbed in Mi'kmaw:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="A scene from Chicken Run overdubbed in Mi'kmaw" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1843854915504-metadata-" title="A scene from Chicken Run overdubbed in Mi'kmaw"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/230/78/chicken_run.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div></span></span></p>  <p>The family's foray into voice acting began&nbsp;as a way to bring joy to Tom&nbsp;and Carol Anne's&nbsp;son, also named&nbsp;Tom,&nbsp;many years ago. He was about four years old when his twin sister died.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Tom Sr.'s brother decided to get the family together to overdub&nbsp;<em>Gordy</em>, a&nbsp;1995 Disney movie about a pig,&nbsp;in Mi'kmaw.</p>  <p>"He wanted [his nephew]&nbsp;to be able to see a movie in his language, because at the age of four, for the most part, he spoke Mi'kmaw," Carol Anne said. "And he thought it was very funny to see all these animals speaking Mi'kmaw."</p>  <p>Tom's brother suggested the family's next project should be <em>Chicken Run, </em>and the&nbsp;idea took on a life of its own after that.</p>  <h2>Project took 6 weeks</h2>  <p>Tom and Carol Anne began&nbsp;spending up to eight hours every night around a microphone in their garage, which&nbsp;was also a recording studio. The entire project took about six weeks.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Once we started, we couldn't stop," said Carol Anne. "We even asked some of our children to come in, make some cameos. We had my niece in there&nbsp;as well."</p>    <p>It was tedious and time-consuming work&nbsp;to match up the syllables in Mi'kmaw with the&nbsp;movement of the characters' mouths, but Tom said it was fun, too.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We got a big kick out of seeing cartoons speaking Mi'kmaw, and we couldn't stop laughing," he said. "We said, 'Wow, this would be fun for our people.'"</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>We got a big kick out of seeing cartoons speaking Mi'kmaw, and we couldn't stop laughing.<svg focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="23px" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g display="none"><g display="inline"><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg></span><cite>- Tom Johnson, Eskasoni</cite></span></blockquote>    <p>In the end,&nbsp;their overdubbed version is&nbsp;not a literal translation, but tries&nbsp;to capture the essence of what the characters said while also throwing in humour and references that Mi'kmaw speakers would enjoy.</p>  <p>In&nbsp;a couple of scenes, you can hear Mi'kmaw music in the background, including from Tom's band, The Relatives.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"That's why it was so successful, because everything in there is very relatable," Carol Anne said.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>'We need more stuff like this'</h2>  <p>Starr&nbsp;Paul, a Mi'kmaw language educator from Eskasoni, remembers watching the film for the first time during a viewing at the high school.</p>  <p>"I was taken aback.

The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months.</p>  <p>The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide in early January showed on Wednesday that "contacts in the leisure and hospitality sectors reported renewed employment cuts due to stricter containment measures."</p>  <p>The central bank also noted that the resurgence in the coronavirus was causing staff shortages in the manufacturing, construction and transportation&nbsp;sectors.</p>  <h2>Most infections of any country</h2>  <p>The virus has infected more than 22.5 million people in the United States and killed over 376,188, the most of any country.&nbsp;More than 4,300 deaths were reported Tuesday, a&nbsp;record high.</p>  <p>Though jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. Economists say it could take several years for the labour market to recover from the pandemic.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5859227.1609502755!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-usa-florida.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5859227.1609502755!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-usa-florida.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5859227.1609502755!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-usa-florida.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5859227.1609502755!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-usa-florida.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5859227.1609502755!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-usa-florida.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5859227.1609502755!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-usa-florida.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Hundreds wait in line to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in Fort Myers, Fla., in late December. Economists are hopeful the economy will turn around in late 2021.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Andrew West/The News-Press/USA Today Network/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"While prospects for the economy later in 2021 are upbeat, the labour market recovery has taken a step backward," said Nancy Vanden Houten, an economist at Oxford Economics, "and we expect claims to remain elevated, with the risk that they rise from last week's levels."</p>  <p>Last week's applications for aid might have been elevated in part because state employment offices had been closed over the holidays, requiring some jobless people to wait until last week to apply.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>5.3 million Americans receiving jobless benefits</h2>  <p>In addition to last week's first-time applications for unemployment aid, the government said Thursday that 5.3 million Americans are continuing to receive state jobless benefits, up from 5.1 million in the previous week. It suggests that fewer people who are out of work are finding jobs.</p>  <p>About 11.6 million people received jobless aid from two federal programs in the week that ended Dec. 26, the latest period for which data is available. One of those programs provides extended benefits to people who have exhausted their state aid. The other supplies benefits to self-employed and contract workers.</p>  <p>Those two programs had expired near the end of December. They were belatedly renewed, through mid-March, in the $900-billion rescue aid package that Congress approved and President Donald Trump signed into law. That legislation also included $600 relief cheques&nbsp;for most adults and a supplemental unemployment benefit payment of $300 a week. Congressional Democrats favour boosting the cheques&nbsp;to $2,000 and extending federal aid beyond March, as does president-elect Joe Biden.</p>    <p>The U.S. job market's weakness was made painfully clear in the December employment report that the government issued last week. Employers shed jobs for the first time since April as the pandemic tightened its grip on consumers and businesses.</p>  <p>The figures also depicted a sharply uneven job market: The losses last month were concentrated among restaurants, bars, hotels and entertainment venues. Educational services, mostly colleges and universities, also cut workers in December. So did film and music studios.</p>  <p>Most other large industries, though, reported job gains. Many economists had expected last spring that job losses would spread to more industries. Though all sectors of the economy initially laid off workers, most of them have avoided deep job cuts. Manufacturing, construction, and professional services like engineering and architecture, for example, all added jobs in December.</p>  <p>At the same time, many companies seem reluctant to sharply ramp up hiring. A government report Tuesday showed that employers advertised fewer open jobs in November than in October. The decline, while small, was widespread across most industries.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><span>On the other hand, just think about how much has changed in technology in the last six years - how is it even possible that a technology which was reported as dead in the water around 2013 is still being written about in 2021? <strong>Is RoR in fact dead, or is it an Internet myth?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you're a business owner looking to improve your existing Ruby on Rails app, or if you're looking to build a web app from scratch, it's all very confusing. Here's what you really need to know about Ruby on Rails app development in the real world.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Which well-known companies use Ruby on Rails for big projects?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="https://themasters.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbVlFIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--5cd3ce3180244c8adb5f0490d6e04f86d2074b76/ruby-on-rails-framework.jpg" alt="Ruby on rails framework" width="500" height="262"></strong></p>
<h4>
<span><strong>Basecamp</strong> <strong>â€“ software for project management/team communications</strong><br></span><span>In fact, Ruby on Rails was born at Basecamp, because they took an existing web application, and extracted the best parts to create the ultimate MVC framework. And right now Basecamp runs on half a dozen platforms, including native mobile apps, with RoR still acting as their preferred backend.</span>
</h4>
<h4>
<strong>GitHub â€“ the biggest code repository in the worldÂ&nbsp;<br></strong><span>On a side-note, RoR includes several features designed specifically to improve application performance. One such feature, Turbolinks, descends from an approach called pjax, which was actually developed at GitHub.</span>
</h4>
<p><strong>And the list of other well-known companies using RoR continues with:<br></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>AirBnB</strong> - they've been using Ruby on Rails since they first started up,</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Crunchbase</strong> - tells you who stands behind innovative companies,</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Dribbble</strong> - a showcase for the world's top design professionals,</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Groupon</strong> - ecommerce marketplace providing special offers and discounts on products and services</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Kickstarter</strong> - crowdsourcing service,</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Pixlr</strong> - photo editing web application,</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Shopify</strong> - huge ecommerce software platform, and</span></li>
<li><span><strong>SlideShare</strong> - hosting service for professional content.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Just by looking at the short list of use-cases above, you can see that many, quite different types of web applications are run on RoR.</p>
<h3><strong>How about performance?</strong></h3>
<p><span>As you can see from the list above of <strong>big companies using RoR</strong>, experienced RoR developers can already maximise performance by leveraging:<br></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>the asset pipeline, which uses several strategies to reduce the number of requests the web browser makes for assets,</span></li>
<li><span>Turbolinks, which maintain a permanent process (just like single-page applications do), so that CSS and JavaScript don't need to be reinitialized and reapplied to the page again,</span></li>
<li><span>techniques to reduce the number of database queries your application makes and improve the performance of slow queries, and</span></li>
<li><span>storing frequently used data so that further requests for the same data will be faster (low-level caching and fragment caching).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>How about the performance of the Ruby language itself? Ruby's inventor, Yukihiro â€œMatzâ€� Matsumoto, has stated his clear intention to make Ruby 3.0 three times faster than Ruby 2.0. He aims to achieve this by improving both memory performance and CPU performance. </span></p>
<p><img title="Ruby on Rails app development" src="https://themasters.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbVVFIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b2c31ec958710b208fb1b697ab5fdac13895f74f/ruby-on-rails-developer.jpg" alt="senior programmer working on ruby on rails code" width="600" height="400"></p>
<h3><strong>Why do programmers like RoR?</strong></h3>
<p><span>RoR is an integrated system that collapses as many unnecessary conceptual models as possible using principles like Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), convention-over-configuration, and English-like semantics. In turn, this leads to simplicity and clarity, which translates to progress at speed.<strong> In short, this allows a programmer to write code that not only makes her smile while she writes it, but also makes a different programmer smile when he later has to extend or patch it.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>From a business perspective, it really isn't a good idea to use a programming language which is the next cool thing on the block. Nope, you'll want to invest in a complete ecosystem which is mature, stable, predictable, reliable, and scales well . Whilst RoR is mature technology it is not stagnant, but it is rather constantly evolving, and that is thanks to all those who actively contribute to its great community. The chances are that, if developers get stuck at any time when developing a particular functionality, there is a ready-to-use gem for it in the massive library of Ruby gems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Why do businesses like RoR?</strong></h3>
<p><span>With RoR, skilful, experienced developers are more productive, that is, they can do <strong>more, faster, and more cost-effectively.</strong> This also means that both the business team and the developers can focus together on business features and complex application logic. In reality, this means that you can fully focus on creating a web app which encapsulates whatever differentiates your business from other businesses.</span></p>
<p><span>It's funny, but you almost never see books or articles about how to develop with RoR in an agile way - it's as if <strong>the agile development process is already part of RoR's DNA.</strong> RoR wins out precisely because it makes it as easy as possible to quickly make a change, and then test that change â€¦ time after time.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What is RoR not good for?</strong></h3>
<p><span>We prefer to be honest, and state clearly that RoR is not really a good option for the following edge-cases:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Simple, static websites â€“ in this case, RoR is over-kill.</span></li>
<li><span>Websites which require only a few function calls to a simple backend.</span></li>
<li><span>Micro/services oriented architecture (M/SOA) - sooner rather than later, this pattern requires large maintenance teams.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span><strong>So what is RoR good for?</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>RoR is highly suitable for the vast majority of web applications, in particular:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>when you need a quick prototype (MVP),</span></li>
<li><span>any application for which you do not yet have a fixed concept, but you're looking for a framework which will allow you to later expand and pivot, as your business needs change,</span></li>
<li><span>standard web applications,</span></li>
<li><span>eCommerce applications,</span></li>
<li><span>custom database solutions, and</span></li>
<li><span>web applications which also leverage some specialist areas, such as Machine Learning or Blockchain - in this case, RoR is ideal in providing a high-performance framework, but connecting to algorithms written in some other language.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>With its focus on productivity, versatility, and stability at scale it's clear that <strong>RoR will be a great choice for developing most web applications for the foreseeable future.</strong></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><data value="https://jlelse.blog/posts/email-messenger-delta-chat"></data><div><p>Published on <time datetime="2021-01-14T17:23:36+01:00">January 14, 2021</time> in <a href="https://jlelse.blog/posts">✍️ Posts</a></p></div><div><p>Today I have heard again a discussion about WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and Threema and there was the question to which messenger one would switch from WhatsApp.</p><p>While I find Telegram very pleasant as an everyday messenger, since it offers me the best user experience and also has some features (bots, channels) that other messengers don’t have, <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/03/delta-chat">Delta Chat came to mind again</a>.</p><p>Everyone has an email address, email is decentralized and Delta Chat encrypts messages automatically.</p><blockquote><p>What I really like about this is, that using the existing email infrastructure enables everyone to communicate with each other without the restriction to use the same messenger or client. Anyone can choose any client and can still be connected. Just login with your usual email account. You don’t even need to use one of those messaging optimized clients and stay with your regular email client.</p><p>– <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/03/delta-chat">Jan-Lukas Else (2019)</a></p></blockquote><p>I installed <a href="https://delta.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Chat</a> on my smartphone again today. While the app wasn’t quite mature 2 years ago, I have to say it’s pretty decent now. The Android app seems to be based on the Signal interface. But Delta Chat is also available for desktops (Windows, macOS and Linux) and iOS. And the best part - something Signal, Threema and WhatsApp have problems with - Delta Chat can be used from multiple devices without any problems.</p><p>But the most important thing: Delta Chat allows you to communicate even with people who don’t use Delta Chat at all, all you need is an email address! If you write to someone without Delta Chat, they will just get a normal email. I would argue that even beats Matrix or XMPP.</p><p>Conclusion: If you are concerned about security when chatting and would rather use a decentralized messenger (no silo), you are in good hands with email and Delta Chat.</p><p>However, it would be advisable not to use Gmail, Outlook or GMX as email service, but a reasonable email service. I use <a href="https://www.servercow.de/mailcow?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mailcow</a> for example, where just today there was <a href="https://mailcow.email/2021/01/14/back-to-the-future-with-delta-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an announcement about Delta Chat</a>.</p></div><p><b>Tags</b>:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<div>

<p>There are plenty of articles explaining why the Python GIL (The Global Interpreter Lock) exists<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, and why it is there. The TLDR version is: the GIL prevents multithreaded pure Python code from using multiple CPU cores.</p>
<p>However, in <a href="https://vaex.io/">Vaex</a> we execute most of the CPU intensive parts in C (C++) code, where we release the GIL. This is a common practice in high-performance Python libraries, where Python acts merely as a high-level glue.</p>
<p>However, the GIL needs to be released explicitly, and this is the responsibility of the programmer and might be forgotten, leading to suboptimal use of your machine.</p>
<p>I recently had this issue in <a href="https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/pull/1114">Vaex</a> where I simply forgot to release the GIL and found a similar issue in <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7756">Apache Arrow</a><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, when running on 64 cores, I sometimes see a performance in Vaex that I am not happy with. It might be using 4000% CPU, instead of 6400% CPU, which is something I am not happy with. Instead of blindly pulling some levers to inspect the effect, I want to understand what is happening, and if the GIL is the problem, why, and where is it holding Vaex down.</p>


</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>

<p>I'm planning to write a series of articles explaining some tools and techniques available for profiling/tracing Python together with native extensions, and how these tools can be glued together, to analyze and visualize what Python is doing, and when the GIL it taken or dropped.</p>
<p>I hope this leads to improvement of tracing, profiling, and other performance tooling in the Python ecosystem, and the performance of the whole Python ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="Linux">
Linux<a href="#Linux"> </a>
</h2>
<p>Get access to a Linux machine, and make sure you have root privileges (sudo is fine), or ask your sysadmin to execute some of these commands for you. For the rest of the document, we only run as user.</p>
<h2 id="Perf">
Perf<a href="#Perf"> </a>
</h2>
<p>Make sure you have perf installed, e.g. on Ubuntu:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo yum install perf</code></pre>
<h2 id="Kernel-configuration">
Kernel configuration<a href="#Kernel-configuration"> </a>
</h2>
<p>To enable running it as a user:</p>

<pre><code># Enable users to run perf (use at own risk)
$ sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=-1

# Enable users to see schedule trace events:
$ sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug
$ sudo mount -o remount,mode=755 /sys/kernel/debug/tracing</code></pre>
<h2 id="Python-packages">
Python packages<a href="#Python-packages"> </a>
</h2>
<p>We will make use of <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m">per4m</a></p>

<pre><code>$ pip install "viztracer&gt;=0.11.2" "per4m&gt;=0.1,&lt;0.2"</code></pre>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>

<p>There is no way to get the GIL state in Python <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">1</a></sup> since there is no API for this. We can track it from the kernel, and the right tool for this under Linux is <strong>perf</strong>.</p>
<p>Using the linux perf tool (aka perf_events), we can listen to the state changes for processes/threads (we only care about sleeping and running), and log them. Although perf may look scary, it is a powerful tool. If you want to know a bit more about perf, I recommend reading <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/04/16/new-perf-zine/">Julia Evans' zine on perf</a> or <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html">go through Brendan Gregg's website</a>.</p>
<p>To build our intuition, we will first run perf on a <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/blob/master/per4m/example0.py">very trivial program</a>:</p>


</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>We listen to just a few events to keep the noise down (note the use of wildcards):</p>

<pre><code>$ perf record -e sched:sched_switch  -e sched:sched_process_fork \
        -e 'sched:sched_wak*' -- python -m per4m.example0
[ perf record: Woken up 2 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0,032 MB perf.data (33 samples) ]</code></pre>
<p>And use the <code>perf script</code> command to write human/parsable output.</p>

<pre><code>$ perf script

</div>

<div>
<div>
<p>Take a moment to digest the output. I can see a few things. Looking at the 4th column (time in seconds), we can see where the program slept (it skips 1 second). Here we see that we enter the sleeping state with a line like:</p>
<p><code>python 3040114 [031] 5563911.112513:                sched:sched_switch: prev_comm=python prev_pid=3040114 prev_prio=120 prev_state=S ==&gt; next_comm=swapper/31 next_pid=0 next_prio=120</code></p>
<p>This means the kernel changed the state of the Python thread to <code>S</code> (=sleeping) state.</p>
<p>A full second later, we see it being woken up:</p>
<p><code>swapper     0 [031] 5563912.113697:                sched:sched_wakeup: comm=python pid=3040114 prio=120 target_cpu=031</code></p>
<p>Of course, you need to build some tooling around this, to really see what is happening. But one can imagine this output can be easily parsed and this is what <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/">per4m</a> does. However, before we go there, I'd first like to visualize the flow of a slightly more advanced program using <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a> is a Python tracer that can visualize what your program does in the browser. Let us run it on a slightly <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/blob/master/per4m/example1.py">more advanced example</a> to see what it looks like.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Running viztracer gives output like:</p>

<pre><code>$ viztracer -o example1.html --ignore_frozen -m per4m.example1
Loading finish                                        
Saving report to /home/maartenbreddels/github/maartenbreddels/per4m/example1.html ...
Dumping trace data to json, total entries: 94, estimated json file size: 11.0KiB
Generating HTML report
Report saved.</code></pre>
<p>And the HTML should render as:
<img src="https://www.maartenbreddels.com/images/copied_from_nb/per4m/example1.png" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>From this, it seems that <code>some_computation</code> seem to be executed in parallel (twice), while in fact, we know the GIL is preventing that. So what is really going on?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>

<p>Let us run <code>perf</code> on this, similarly to what we did to example0.py. However, we add the argument <code>-k CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code> so that we use <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/blob/3321ba4024afe5623f938a601d7f7db3b08f534d/src/viztracer/modules/snaptrace.c#L91">the same clock as VizTracer</a> and ask VizTracer to generate a JSON, instead of an HTML file:</p>

<pre><code>$ perf record -e sched:sched_switch  -e sched:sched_process_fork -e 'sched:sched_wak*' \
   -k CLOCK_MONOTONIC  -- viztracer -o viztracer1.json --ignore_frozen -m per4m.example1</code></pre>
<p>Then …</p></div></div></div></div>

                    <p>Our product completely supports Java and we love Java developers. However, internally for our own code, we believe <a href="https://movingfulcrum.com/the-era-of-the-jvm-is-coming-to-an-end/">the era of the JVM is coming to an end</a>.</p><p>We found these 3 things initially attractive about Go:</p><ol><li>Instant compile times and program startup for faster development</li><li>Virtual threads for dealing with high concurrency workloads</li><li>Value types to better control memory usage</li></ol><p>We found a ton more to like later, but this was enough to give it a go.</p><h3 id="hurdles">Hurdles</h3><p>Right off the bat, Go's compile-time enforced formatting rules and casing of variables seemed like a weird choice. However, soon after I warmed up to them knowing that they enforced a certain amount of code uniformity across our codebase.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why does Golang use identifer capitalization for public/private visibility? This seemed like an insane design decision to me. Now I realize. Go is simply saying 'Naming conventions are not guidelines, they are rules'. Uniform naming conventions across 100% of Go code is good.</p>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1346528650137538560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The biggest hurdle though was the lack of an equivalent of a Spring Framework for Go. While the Go ecosystem has multiple libraries for all kinds of functionality, there didn't seem to be a standard way of doing things like logging, dependency injection, environment configuration, etc. We had to solve this before we could adopt Go in a major way in our organization. Thus, alongside developing the first few microservices, we kept working on an in-house framework, Gallium. The Gallium Framework could use a blog post of its own. In short, it standardizes on some libraries in the &nbsp;Go ecosystem for things like Logging, DI, etc, and makes it easy to structure microservices for our environment. We keep evolving Gallium with learnings from each Go microservice we develop.</p><p>We do miss <a href="https://blog.astradot.com/why-we-use-jooq-instead-of-hibernate/">JOOQ</a> though. <code>goqu</code> comes close, but its not the same.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I would gladly pay for a version of <a href="https://twitter.com/JavaOOQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JavaOOQ</a> that generated Golang code</p>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1342940430799785984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Also, the <code>time</code> package could use some improvements:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Golang not parsing ISO8601 Durations seems like a weird omission</p>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1345158151146938368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Though, its still a <em>lot</em> better than the <code>java.time</code> insanity:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Java 8's 'new' Time API:</p><p>Wanna store time? Pick from</p><p>1. Instant<br>2. LocalDateTime<br>3. OffsetDateTime<br>4. ZonedDateTime<br>5. LocalTime<br>6. OffsetTime<br>7. LocalDate</p><p>Wanna store ISO Period? Pick from</p><p>1. Period<br>2.

</figure><h3 id="in-the-land-of-magic">In the land of magic</h3><p>We took one of our simpler but high throughout Spring Boot service called <code>metric-query</code> and converted it to Go. <code>metric-query</code> takes in queries from our dashboard and runs them against our metric database. Since our dashboards refresh every 2 seconds, it can get a lot of requests at once. In the JVM world, each of these requests would spawn a whole thread.</p><p>After converting to Golang, we saw the memory usage drop by 40x! We had to double-check that our charts were not faulty.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Converted a high throughput service from Kotlin &amp; Spring Boot to Golang. Memory usage went down from ~800MB per instance to ~20MB per instance!! <a href="https://t.co/KATZenY8OG">pic.twitter.com/KATZenY8OG</a></p>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1345525850670649344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This convinced us we were &nbsp;on the right path and the investment in Go was worth it.</p><p>We then converted our highest throughout service, <code>metric-collector</code>. It ingests data from all our agents and puts it on Kafka. It receives a ton of requests all at the same time. The Spring Boot version was maxing the CPU on the nodes it was deployed and eating up tons of memory. &nbsp;Latency was all over the place.</p><p>Converting it to Go and watching the graphs was pure magic. CPU usage and latency dropped to almost nothing. Memory usage dropped to insignificant levels. This could be a case study for virtual threads.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kafka producer latency after switching ultra high throughput app from Kotlin to Golang.

</figure><p>We have continued converting each microservice from Kotlin/Spring Boot to Go and its magical each time watching those graphs drop.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cant get enough of seeing the graphs change as I switch a service from Kotlin to Go <a href="https://t.co/kS2nNPRv29">pic.twitter.com/kS2nNPRv29</a></p>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1348946882916089856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><h3 id="looking-back-at-jvm-world">Looking back at JVM world</h3><p>I have been programming on the JVM for almost 2 decades. Switching to Go was quite a change for me personally too.</p><p>But looking back, the Java/Spring world seems to be toppling to maintain compatibility with all its legacy. It is mind-boggling to think a microservice in 2021 still needs Tomcat to run. Spring MVC is layers and layers of code to get Java Servlets, which were released in 1996, somehow feel relevant in 2021. Kotlin is another massive layer to make Java feel like a modern language.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I remember writing this Spring MVC code and thinking it was so clean. Now that my blinders are off, it feels like a messy DSL built on annotations. No way to step through flow of logic. To do anything, I need to find appropriate annotation by digging through docs.

</figure><p>The Maven/Gradle build system seems like a ridiculous, unnecessary complexity compared to Go's dependency management.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It is so liberating to be free of the complexity of Maven/Gradle/NPM/Webpack. </p><p>All one really needs to build a project is a text files with dependencies listed on each line.

</figure><p>The JVM, Java, and Spring were great for an era indeed. In 2021, they feel like an 80-yr old trying to compete in the Olympics by taking artificial performance enhancing drugs.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><h2>Upcoming licensing changes to Elasticsearch and Kibana</h2><p>We are moving our Apache 2.0-licensed source code in Elasticsearch and Kibana to be dual licensed under Server Side Public License (SSPL) and the Elastic License, giving users the choice of which license to apply. This license change ensures our community and customers have free and open access to use, modify, redistribute, and collaborate on the code. It also protects our continued investment in developing products that we distribute for free and in the open by restricting cloud service providers from offering Elasticsearch and Kibana as a service without contributing back. This will apply to all maintained branches of these two products and will take place before our upcoming 7.11 release. Our releases will continue to be under the Elastic License as they have been for the last three years.
</p><p>This change in source code licensing has <b>no impact on the overwhelming majority of our user community</b> who use our default distribution for free. It also has <b>no impact on our cloud customers or self-managed software customers</b>.</p><p>In recent years, the market has evolved, and the community has come to appreciate that open source companies need to better protect their software to continue to innovate and make the investments required. As companies continue the shift to SaaS offerings, some cloud service providers have taken open source products and provided them as a service without investing back into the community. Moving to the dual license strategy with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">SSPL</a> or the Elastic License is a natural next step for us after opening our commercial code and creating a free tier, all under the Elastic License, nearly 3 years ago. It is similar to those made by many other open source companies over these years, including <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">MongoDB</a>, which developed the SSPL. The SSPL allows free and unrestricted use, as well as modification, with the simple requirement that if you provide the product as a service, you must also publicly release any modifications as well as the source code of your management layers  under SSPL.
</p><h2>Our open origins</h2><p>My personal journey with open source goes a long way back. In 2005, I open sourced my first project, Compass, to provide a Java framework on top of Apache Lucene while I was building a recipe app for my wife. In the following five years, I invested many weekends and nights working on it, from writing code to helping users with bugs, features, and questions.
</p><p>I had no idea what I was signing up for, especially with a day job “on the side,” but I fell in love with the opportunity to make such a positive impact — trying to build a great product, but more importantly, a great community around it, through the power of open source.
</p><p>In 2009, I decided to do it again, and started to write a brand new project called Elasticsearch. I spent many nights and weekends building it, and in 2010 open sourced it. I even quit my job and decided to dedicate my full attention to it. To be there for the users, through writing code, and engaging on GitHub, mailing lists, and IRC.
</p><p>And when we founded Elastic as a company in 2012, we brought the same spirit to our company. We invested heavily in our free and open products, and supported the rapid growth of our community of users. We expanded from just Elasticsearch to Kibana, Logstash, Beats, and now a complete set of solutions built into the Elastic Stack: Elastic Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security.
</p><p>We have matured the products, fostered vibrant communities around them, and focused on providing the greatest amount of value to our users. Today, we have hundreds of engineers who wake up every day and work to make our products even better. And we have hundreds of thousands of community members who engage with us and contribute to our shared success.
</p><p>I am proud of the company we built, and humbled by the level of trust that we have earned with our user base. This starts by being open and transparent, and continues with being true to our community and user base in our choices.
</p><h2>Free and open FTW</h2><p>Back in 2018, we <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/doubling-down-on-open">opened the code of our free and paid proprietary features</a> under the Elastic License, a source-available license, and we changed our default distribution to include all of our features, with all free features enabled by default.
</p><p>We did this for a few reasons. It allowed us to engage with our paying customers in the same way we engage with our community: in the open. It also allowed us to build free features that empower our users without providing those capabilities to companies that take our products and provide them as a service, like Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and profit from our open source software without contributing back.
</p><p>This approach was well received — today, over 90% of new downloads choose this distribution — and has allowed us to make so much of our work available for free while also building a successful company.
</p><p>The list of improvements under this new free and open, yet proprietary, license, is overwhelming. I am humbled by the amazing progress our team and community has made across all our products, so much so that I would love to share some of them:
</p><p>We've dramatically improved the speed, scalability, and reliability of Elasticsearch, with a new distributed consensus algorithm and significantly reduced memory usage, in addition to new data storage and compression approaches that have reduced the typical index size by nearly 40% while improving indexing and query throughput. We added new field types for geospatial analysis, and more efficient ways to store and search logs and perform fast, case-insensitive search on security data. In Kibana, we cut load time by 80% and eliminated whole-page refreshes thanks to a multiyear replatforming project, while at the same time introducing an intuitive drag-and-drop data visualization experience with Kibana Lens, key capabilities like dashboard drill-downs, and so much more.
</p><p>Over the last three years, we also built first-class experiences around our most common use cases. In the security area, we created a free and open SIEM right inside Kibana, with a powerful detection engine that supports simple rules as well as complex correlations via a new query language called EQL in Elasticsearch. We include hundreds of detection rules, which we develop publicly, in collaboration with our community. And we joined forces with Endgame, a leading endpoint security company, and have released powerful malware protection for free as part of the Elastic Agent, our unified, centrally managed observability and security agent for servers and endpoints, with more to come.
</p><p>In observability, the story is similar. We've built an entire observability suite right inside Kibana — from a live-tail logging UI to an intuitive infrastructure-level view of the key metrics and alerts across your hosts, pods, and containers. And we now have a fully featured APM product with open source data collectors and agents, supporting OpenTelemetry, real user monitoring (RUM), synthetic monitoring, and the recent addition of user experience monitoring.
</p><p>With Elastic Enterprise Search, we introduced App Search, a layer on top of Elasticsearch that simplifies building rich applications and provides powerful management interfaces for relevance tuning, as well as analytics on how it's being used. We also provide a free Workplace Search product that makes it easy to integrate and search the content sources that you use to run your life or company, like Google Workplace, Microsoft 365, Atlassian Jira and Confluence, and Salesforce.
</p><p>It is simply amazing that we've been able to build all of these capabilities and provide them for free to our community. It has been humbling to see the level of engagement and adoption around our products and how these new features have helped so many people and businesses succeed. And this was possible because the overwhelming majority of our community chose our default distribution under the Elastic License, where all these features are free and open.
</p><h2>Why change?</h2><p>As previously mentioned, over the last three years, the market has evolved and the community has come to appreciate that open source companies need to better protect their software in order to maintain a high level of investment and innovation. With the shift to SaaS as a delivery model, some cloud service providers have taken advantage of open source products by providing them as a service, without contributing back. This diverts funds that would have been reinvested into the product and hurts users and the community.
</p><p>Similar to our open source peers, we have lived this experience firsthand, from our trademarks being misused to outright attempts to splinter our community with “open” repackaging of our OSS products or even taking “inspiration” from our proprietary code. While each open source company has taken a slightly different approach to address this issue, they have generally modified their open source license in order to protect their investment in free software, while trying to preserve the principles of openness, transparency, and collaboration. Similarly, we are taking the natural next step of making a targeted change to how we license our source code. This change won't affect the vast majority of our users, but it will restrict cloud service providers from offering our software as a service.
</p><p>We expect that a few of our competitors will attempt to spread all kinds of FUD around this change. Let me be clear to any naysayers. We believe deeply in the principles of free and open products, and of transparency with the community. Our track record speaks to this commitment, and we will continue to build upon it.
</p><h2>The change</h2><p>Starting with the upcoming Elastic 7.11 release, we will be moving the Apache 2.0-licensed code of Elasticsearch and Kibana to be dual licensed under SSPL and the Elastic License, giving users the choice of which license to apply. SSPL is a source-available license created by MongoDB to embody the principles …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>. While I personally don’t consider <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> to be 10 years old yet - the language that became what Elixir is today <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/6052352b6281752b905b30eb5b08fac0f51f68cd">surfaced only 14 months later</a> - a decade is a mark to celebrate!</p>
<p>
The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/elixirtalk/episode-166-feat-sean-stavropoulos">podcast</a>), <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir/">case</a>) also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/11-logflare-is-a-log-management-and-event-analytics-platform">podcast</a>), and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> (<a href="https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/19-hexpm-is-elixirs-official-package-manager">podcast</a>) itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>
<p>
Most recently, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-reactid="52"><p>This article is a part of my series about concurrency and asynchronous
programming in Swift. The articles are independent, but after reading this one
you might want to check out the rest of the series:</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This article is about an experimental feature, which is not available in a stable
version of Swift as of January 2021. APIs and behaviors described in this article may change without notice as new
development snapshots become available, but I will try to keep sample code updated as we get closer
to general availability of <a href="https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/structured-concurrency/proposals/nnnn-structured-concurrency.md">structured concurrency</a> in Swift.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are many discussions of the imminent introduction of <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> to Swift. The authors of
Swift concurrency proposals have done monumental work in preparing all of the related features. And
there are many of them. Just have a look at the actual “dependency tree” of the proposals:</p>
<p>

    </p>

<p>Around the time <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> proposal was accepted, I saw people asking almost the same set of
questions: how to convert legacy APIs to async? How an entrypoint to <code>async</code> code would look like? While
examples of usage of <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> in UIKit apps were shared around, there were no good
examples that utilized the structured concurrency proposal. I wanted to have a look at some minimal
isolated code snippets that could help me answer these questions.</p>
<h2>Setting up a SwiftPM project</h2>
<p>Turns out, it’s relatively easy to set up a CLI project with SwiftPM that uses <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.
Please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/SwiftConcurrencyExample">clone the final result from GitHub</a>
to follow along. The <code>README.md</code> file in the repository also contains important installation steps, as the
standard toolchain supplied in the latest stable Xcode currently won’t work. You’ll have to install
a development toolchain as described in the document to run this example code on your own machine.
In the rest of the article I’m going to review this example project piece by piece.</p>
<h3>Compiler flags</h3>
<p>Notice how the target needs to be declared in <code>Package.swift</code>:</p>

<p>Until Swift concurrency features become stable and enabled by default you have to pass these flags
when building. They are declared in the package manifest here so that you don’t have to pass them
each time manually when building the project.</p>
<h3>Imports</h3>
<p>When using <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-structured-concurrency/43452">structured concurrency</a>
to expose legacy callback-based APIs as <code>async</code> functions, you currently have to import the
<code>_Concurrency</code> module supplied with the latest Swift dev snapshots. The name of it starts with an
underscore to highlight that the module is experimental and its API may change.</p>
<h2>Reviewing the code</h2>
<h3>Continuations</h3>
<p>While most of Apple’s APIs will be converted to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>
<a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0297-concurrency-objc.md">automatically</a>,
your own callback-based code can be converted using a few helper functions, such as
<code>withUnsafeContinuation</code> and <code>withUnsafeThrowingContinuation</code>. They take a closure with a single
<em>continuation</em> argument, and you’re supposed to call your callback-based code from this closure,
capture the continuation, and call <code>resume</code> on it when you’re finished. Here’s how the declarations look for
the non-throwing variant for more context:</p>

    <div data-language="swift">
      <pre><code><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>UnsafeContinuation</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>resume</span><span>(</span><span>returning</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>withUnsafeContinuation</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>operation</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>UnsafeContinuation</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>T</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>One of the most simple but practical enough example of a non-throwing async call is <code>sleep</code>:</p>

    <div data-language="swift">
      <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>_Concurrency</span><span>
</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>Dispatch</span><span>

</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>seconds</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>withUnsafeContinuation</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>DispatchQueue</span><span>.global</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>            </span><span>.asyncAfter</span><span>(</span><span>deadline</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>.now</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>.seconds</span><span>(</span><span>seconds</span><span>))</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>                </span><span>c</span><span>.resume</span><span>(</span><span>returning</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>())</span><span>
</span><span>            </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>And here’s a throwing variant:</p>

    <div data-language="swift">
      <pre><code><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>UnsafeThrowingContinuation</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>resume</span><span>(</span><span>returning</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>resume</span><span>(</span><span>throwing</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>withUnsafeThrowingContinuation</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>operation</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>UnsafeThrowingContinuation</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>throws</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>T</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Based on that we can convert <code>URLSession.dataTask</code> to a throwing <code>async</code> function:</p>

    <div data-language="swift">
      <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>Foundation</span><span>

</span><span>            </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>task</span><span>.resume</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Here the continuation <code>c</code> argument of the closure passed to <code>withUnsafeThrowingContinuation</code> becomes
your “callback”. You have to call <code>resume</code> on it exactly once with either a success value or an
<code>Error</code> value. Multiple calls to <code>resume</code> on the same continuation are invalid, since
<code>async</code> functions can’t throw or return more than once. If you don’t ever call <code>resume</code> on the
continuation you’ll get a function that never returns or throws, which is just as wrong as throwing
or returning more than once.</p>
<h3>The entry point</h3>
<p>As you probably noticed, in previous examples we got <code>async</code> functions, but how do you actually call them from
non-<code>async</code> code? Currently, the <code>runAsyncAndBlock</code> function is an entry point you would use to
interact with an <code>async</code> function from your blocking synchronous code:</p>

    <div data-language="swift">
      <pre><code><span>runAsyncAndBlock</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"task started"</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>try</span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>download</span><span>(</span><span>"https://httpbin.org/uuid"</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>.utf8</span><span>)</span><span>!</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"end of main"</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Note that in the current toolchain (<code>DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2021-01-12-a</code> at the moment of writing)
<code>runAsyncAndBlock</code> does not take throwing closures as arguments, thus <code>try!</code> or <code>do</code>/<code>catch</code> blocks
are required to call a throwing <code>async</code> function such as <code>download</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>print</code> statements here are added so that you can observe the execution sequence and to make sure
that your <code>async</code> code is actually called.</p>
<p>Remember that you should not use <code>runAsyncAndBlock</code> in your GUI code running on the
main thread, as it will block the event loop from processing any input from your user. This will
result in your app being frozen until the <code>async</code> closure body has finished. In a CLI app that
doesn’t expect any input this is fine though. In GUI apps you’d either have to call <code>runAsyncAndBlock</code>
on a background thread that can be blocked, or use async handlers or actors to host your async code.
Given that proposals for async handlers and actors aren’t available yet, we’re leaving those
advanced topics out, and focus on a simple command-line app here.</p>
<h3>Launching concurrent tasks with “async let”</h3>
<p>Let’s say you need to fetch UUIDs for multiple entities, but you can only get a single one through
an asynchronous call. In some naive implementation you would <code>await</code> for async calls repeatedly
one by one until you fetch all of the data. This is highly inefficient if these calls are independent
and can all run simultaneously without disrupting each other.</p>
<p>You can launch multiple async tasks concurrently with <code>async let</code> declarations. Then if you need to
wait for all of them to complete, just use a single <code>await</code> marker on both of the values that
were declared with <code>async let</code>:</p>

    <div data-language="swift">
      <pre><code><span>func</span><span> </span><span>childTasks</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>throws</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"\(</span><span>#function</span><span>) started"</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>    </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>uuid1</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>download</span><span>(</span><span>"https://httpbin.org/uuid"</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>uuid2</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>download</span><span>(</span><span>"https://httpbin.org/uuid"</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>"""</span><span>
</span><span>    ids fetched conncurrently:</span><span>
</span><span>    uuid1: \(</span><span>String</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>uuid1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>.utf8</span><span>)</span><span>!</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>    uuid2: \(</span><span>String</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>uuid2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>.utf8</span><span>)</span><span>!</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>    """</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Here two separate <code>uuid1</code> and <code>uuid2</code> tasks are launched concurrently, and they don’t block each
other. The <code>try! await</code> markers before <code>print</code> mean that <code>print</code> won’t evaluate before both of the
tasks have completed. Compare this with the old
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch"><code>Dispatch</code></a> approach, where instead of <code>async let</code> you’d have to set up a
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchgroup"><code>DispatchGroup</code></a> instance, which
is much more cumbersome to work with.</p>
<h3>Cancellation</h3>
<p>Tasks launched with <code>async let</code> are called <em>“child tasks”</em>, and this is important when you think
about cancellation. <code>async let</code> forms an implicit task hierarchy which reflects call stacks of async
functions. In the code above <code>await childTasks()</code> launches one parent task, which then spawns two
more child tasks for <code>download</code> calls. When a parent task is cancelled, its child tasks are
cancelled too.</p>
<p>The most critical thing to highlight is that cancellation with Swift’s structured concurrency is
cooperative, i.e. tasks need to “cooperate” in an explicit way to get cancelled as early as
possible. This is done with <code>checkCancellation()</code> and
<code>isCancelled()</code> static functions declared on the <code>Task</code> type from the <code>_Concurrency</code> module:</p>

    <div data-language="swift">
      <pre><code><span>extension</span><span> </span><span>Task</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>static</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>isCancelled</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Bool</span><span>

</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>CancellationError</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>init</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>static</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>checkCancellation</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>throws</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Why do you need to call these functions instead of the concurrency runtime just cancelling tasks
automatically? The runtime doesn’t know what your task is doing, it may need to save and close a
file handle, save the state of an expensive computation, or do whatever cleanup is needed.
Cancelling tasks preemptively would lead to much more complexity, while forcing tasks to account
for possible cancellation at any arbitrary line of code.</p>
<p>A <code>try await Task.checkCancellation()</code> call executed within a task will throw
<code>Task.CancellationError</code> if this task was previously cancelled, …</p></div></div>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>Today, I’m going to show you the worst pieces of code I’ve ever seen. Some devilries that should never be produced! Unless you want to be hated by your colleagues and your users. We’ll see that with a few good practices, it’s easy to avoid them.</p>



<h3>Devilry</h3>



<p><strong>There’s a difference between code that needs to be improved and what I call a devilry.</strong></p>



<p>No matter the language, a devilry is a dirty piece of code that endangers the stability and maintainability of the project. And I can tell you that I’ve seen a lot of devilry.</p>



<p>When it piles up, your project quickly becomes like the basement of hell. And if you’re the one who’s making a mess everywhere, the lead tech in the kitchen is going to start looking at you differently.</p>

<h3>Ambiguity and inconsistency</h3>



<p><strong>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away</strong>, I arrived one morning and was jumped on as if it was the end of the world.</p>



<p>A huge bug in prod. All the system tickets in production return “null” for no reason. <strong>Chaos everywhere. </strong>Everyone was running around like headless chickens.</p>



<p>I sprint to my station and first reflex, I look at Kibana. No logs.No nothing. Fuck, this is not a good start.</p>



<p>So I decide to retrace the path of creation of the ticket.</p>



<p>To do so, I have to go into the depths of internals libraries that have been around since the Jurassic era. At the end of my archaeological work, I arrive in one of the responsible files.</p>



<p><strong>And i saw this</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">// use id and expire to get ticket
async function get_ticket(i, expire) {
  return CheckisNotExp(expire).then(async function() {
    var t = await GetTicketModel(i)
    if (t) {
      return t
    } else {
      logger.error(JSON.stringify(t))
      return null
    }
  }).catch(async function(e)  {
      logger.error(JSON.stringify(e))
      return null
})
}</pre>



<figure id="block-a351ed13-b796-4b89-ad82-7c679c353d72"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETkK_9DXkAEmUlg.jpg" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETkK_9DXkAEmUlg.jpg" alt="oof"></figure>



<p><em>Is there really an “i” variable ? Where are we now? That’s an id, right? Integer or UUID? And what exactly is expire? Is it a date or a timestamp? Why is there camelCase, PascalCase and snake_case? Async notation with promises and async notation again? If something fails we return null? DEVILRY!</em></p>



<hr>



<p>At this moment, half the company Skype me every 5 minutes to get an ETA for the fix.</p>



<p><strong>So first, git blame, someone need to know what’s going on here.</strong></p>



<p>I quickly realized that it’s not one person who is responsible, but three. Two people have left the company a long time ago, the third hasn’t arrived yet this morning. Classic scenario.</p>



<p>According to Git, these three people have touched this file at very distant times. Hence the inconsistency, the different styles, the different ECMAScript versions and the different ways of handling promises.</p>



<p>I take this opportunity to suggest you the best conference on promises I’ve ever seen.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Broken Promises" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3Nh350b6S4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>I was in the room at this conference!</strong> I know, nobody care.</p>



<p>Anyway, in this piece of code, everything is ambiguous, everything is inconsistent. <strong>It’s a perfect example of what you should avoid at all costs.</strong> Needless to say, the code review didn’t go through that.</p>



<p><strong>Well now, we have to rewrite this quickly.</strong></p>



<p>I’m changing the names of the variables and functions. No ambiguity allowed. Async / Await everywhere and in the same way.</p>



<p>I’m also making sure I don’t hide any errors under the mat with a null return. These errors must break the function if something goes wrong. Exceptions should be handled by the layer above.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="js" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">// hotfix
// @todo rewrite the ticket module entirely
async function getTicket(ticketUuid, ticketExpirationTimestamp) {
  await validTicketExpiration(ticketUuid, ticketExpirationTimestamp)
  const ticket = await getTicketByUuid(ticketUuid)

  return ticket
}</pre>



<p>The really good solution would be to rewrite part of the module. <strong>The ticket validation logic is bad here.</strong> But it’s not urgent.</p>



<p>The urgency is to spot and fix the error.</p>



<p>And right after updating the code, the real error starts to show its face. <strong>A configuration change made the day before had changed the ticket creation behavior.</strong> Returning to the previous configuration immediately fixed the problem.</p>



<p>The following week, the module in question was completely rewritten.</p>



<h3>Spaghetti Bolognese</h3>



<p><strong>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away</strong>, I was working on a product with a clean, square code.</p>



<p>Like any good product, everything was optimized inside. Features made with as little code as possible. A strong attention to readability. A strict follow up of all good practices ensured by a code review managed by clean code nazis.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtmFCcjEgEw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOLID</a>, <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/dry-principle-cost-benefit-example/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DRY</a>, <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/software-design-principles-dry-and-kiss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KISS</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/yagni-you-aint-gonna-need-it-f9a178cd8e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAGNI</a> and every other acronym you can think of.</p>



<p>It was so clean, you could have eaten off the floor.</p>



<p><strong>Even so, a very specific part of the product would break intermittently.</strong></p>

<p>During a sprint, I eventually managed to negotiate time to investigate the case.</p>



<p>Very quickly, I realize that the problem is not the product. <strong>Errors have only one thing in common: a dependency.</strong> An internal dependency solved via an internal <a href="https://jfrog.com/artifactory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artifactory</a>.</p>



<p>It is managed by another team and – very surprisingly – the code is not freely available. You have to ask a permission to see it. So I ask for access to understand what’s going on.</p>



<p><strong>I then receive a slack message or I’m asked why I want access.</strong></p>



<p>“-Hi! Why do you need access on this repository ?”<br>“-What do you mean why? Are you aware that I work here? Hold on, I’m on my way.”</p>



<p>After a surprise armlock on the person, I end up having access to the project.</p>



<p>I see a single file in it. 300 Ko in size. 300 Ko of text, it’s huge. It hasn’t been touched for several years. The name of the person who last touched it is completely unknown to me.</p>



<p>The worst devilry.</p>



<p><strong>The biggest spaghetti code I’ve ever seen in my life.</strong> For the sake of length, and to preserve your sanity, I’m not putting everything in. Just a very short excerpt of what I saw inside.</p>



<p>Careful, it stings the eyes.</p>

<p><strong>I didn’t even try to touch this demon child.</strong></p>



<p>In a case like this, the solution is not through the code. I called a meeting with my team araound a table to explain the situation. My plan was simple.</p>



<p><strong>We don’t touch it. </strong></p>



<p>We replace this satanic dependency with an open-source module that is already available. As always, there was a major problem. It was necessary to work a little to plug the new dependency correctly.</p>



<p>The rapid investigation was turning into a big task of several days.</p>



<p><strong>The scrum master at the other end of the table was furious.</strong> The more the discussion went on, the more I felt that it was going to be difficult to avoid touching the damn thing. And as I presented it, the discussion ended with a no.</p>



<p><em>“You just touch the minimum to fix the module and we’ll move on.”</em></p>



<p>So I did what developers should do more for code quality and sustainability of projects over time. <strong>I said no.</strong> I even went further.</p>



<p>For the first and only time in my career, I said I was ready to resign if I was forced to.</p>



<p>They obviously asked other developers. <strong>Everyone refused.</strong></p>



<p>Because of the seriousness of all this, I was given time to replace the module. I developed a <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small adapter</a> for the open source dependency. Then I got rid of the cursed dependency.</p>



<p>The product worked like a charm after that.</p>



<p>If developers talk so much about spaghetti code, there’s a good reason for that. <strong>It’s the worst kind of code you can work on. </strong></p>



<p>It doesn’t require a huge investment to make sure you avoid it.</p>



<h3>Exorcism</h3>



<p>Originally, this article was intended to be a list of best practices.</p>



<p><em>“Why and how to apply good practices as a developer.”</em></p>



<p>Apart from the fact that this title has the same effect as a high-dose sleeping pill, I changed my plans for two reasons.</p>

<p>This is an tutorial of
<a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">OpenAI GPT architecture</a>.
We got a bunch of implementation details from
<a href="https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT">minGPT</a>
by <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy">@karpathy</a>.
This implementation also uses character tiny shakespeare dataset.</p>
<p>GPT model is essentially a standard transformer with a few tweaks.
GPT-2 and especially GPT-3 models are quite large and won’t fit on a
single GPU and will need model parallelism.
This implementation doesn’t even use data parallelism and is intended to be
more of a tutorial.</p>
<p>Main differences of this to a standard autoregressive transformer
are the parameter initialization, weight decay, and learning rate schedule.
For the transformer we reuse the
<a href="https://lab-ml.com/labml_nn/transformers/">existing labml/nn transformer implementation</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a notebook for training a GPT model on Tiny Shakespeare dataset.</p>

<p>Data. It’s everywhere and we’re <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/#gref">only getting more of it</a>. For the last 5-10 years, <em>data science</em> has attracted newcomers near and far trying to get a taste of that forbidden fruit. </p>
<p>But what does the state of <em>data science</em> hiring look like today?</p>
<p>Here’s the gist of the article in two-sentences for the busy reader.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: There are <strong>70% more open roles</strong> at companies in <em>data engineering</em> as compared to <em>data science</em>. As we train the next generation of data and machine learning practitioners, let’s place more emphasis on engineering skills.</p>
<hr>
<p>As part of my work developing an <a href="https://www.confetti.ai/">educational platform</a> for data professionals, I think a lot about how the market for data-driven (machine learning and data science) roles is evolving. </p>
<p>In talking to dozens of prospective entrants to data fields including students at top institutions around the world, I’ve seen a tremendous amount of confusion around what skills are most important to help candidates stand out in the crowd and prepare for their careers. </p>
<p>When you think about it, a <em>data scientist</em> can be responsible for any subset of the following: machine learning modelling, visualization, data cleaning and processing (i.e. SQL wrangling), engineering, and production deployment. </p>
<p>How do you even begin to recommend a study curriculum for newcomers?</p>
<p>Data speaks louder than words. So I decided to do an analysis of the data roles being hired for at every company coming out of <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y-Combinator</a> since 2012. The questions that guided my research:</p>
<ul>
<li>What data roles are companies most frequently hiring for?</li>
<li>How in-demand is the conventional <em>data scientist</em> that we talk about so much?</li>
<li>Are the same skills that started the data revolution relevant today?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want the full details and analysis, read on. </p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>I chose to do an analysis of YC portfolio companies that claim to make some sort of data work part of their value proposition. </p>
<p>Why focus on YC? Well, for starters, they do a good job of providing an easily searchable (and scrapable) <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/">directory of their companies</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, as a particularly forward-thinking incubator that has funded companies from around the world across domains for over a decade, I felt they provided a representative sample of the market with which to conduct my analyses. That being said, take what I say wit a grain of salt, as I didn’t analyze super-large tech companies.</p>
<p>I scraped the homepage URLs of every YC company since 2012, producing an initial pool of ~1400 companies. </p>
<p>Why stop at 2012? Well, 2012 was the year that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a> won the ImageNet competition, effectively kickstarting the machine learning and data-modelling wave we are now living through. It’s fair to say that this birthed some of the earliest generations of data-first companies.</p>
<p>From this initial pool, I performed keyword filtering to reduce the number of relevant companies I would have to look through. In particular, I only considered companies whose websites included at least one of the following terms: AI, CV, NLP, natural language processing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine, ML, data. I also disregarded companies whose website links were broken. </p>
<p>Did this generate a ton of false positives? Absolutely! But here I was trying to prioritize high recall as much as possible, recognizing that I would do a more fine-grained manual inspection of the individual websites for relevant roles.</p>
<p>With this reduced pool, I went through every site, found where they were advertising jobs (typically a <em>Careers</em>, <em>Jobs</em>, or <em>We’re Hiring</em> page), and took note of every role that included data, machine learning, NLP, or CV in the title. This gave me a pool of about 70 distinct companies hiring for data roles. </p>
<p>One note here: it’s conceivable that I missed some companies as there were certain websites with very little information (typically those in stealth) that might actually be hiring. In addition, there were companies that didn’t have a formal <em>Careers</em> page but asked that prospective candidates reach out directly via email. </p>
<p>I disregarded both of these types of companies rather than reach out to them, so they are not part of this analysis.</p>
<p>Another thing: the bulk of this research was done towards the final weeks of 2020. Open roles may have changed as companies update their pages periodically. However, I don’t believe this will drastically impact the conclusions drawn. </p>
<h2>What Are Data Practitioners Responsible For?</h2>
<p>Before diving into the results, it’s worth spending some time clarifying what responsibilities each data role is typically responsible for. Here are the four roles we will spend our time looking at with a short description of what they do:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data scientist</em>: Use various techniques in statistics and machine learning to process and analyse data. Often responsible for building models to probe what can be learned from some data source, though often at a prototype rather than production level. </li>
<li><em>Data engineer</em>: Develops a robust and scalable set of data processing tools/platforms. Must be comfortable with SQL/NoSQL database wrangling and building/maintaining ETL pipelines.</li>
<li><em>Machine Learning (ML) Engineer</em>: Often responsible for both training models and productionizing them. Requires familiarity with some high-level ML framework and also must be comfortable building scalable training, inference, and deployment pipelines for models.</li>
<li><em>Machine Learning (ML) Scientist</em>: Works on cutting-edge research. Typically responsible for exploring new ideas that can be published at academic conferences. Often only needs to prototype new state-of-the-art models before handing off to ML engineers for productionization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Many Data Roles Are There?</h2>
<p>So what happens when we plot the frequency of each data role that companies are hiring for? The plot looks  like this:</p>

<p>What immediately stands out is how many more open <em>data engineer</em> roles there are compared to traditional <em>data scientists</em>. In this case, the raw counts correspond to companies hiring <strong>roughly 55% more</strong> for data engineers than data scientists, and roughly the same number of machine learning engineers as data scientists.</p>
<p>But we can do more. If you look at the titles of the various roles, there seems to be some repetition. </p>
<p>Let’s only provide coarse-grained categorization through role consolidation. In other words, I took roles whose descriptions were roughly equivalent and consolidated them under a single title. </p>
<p>That included the following set of equivalence relations: </p>

<p>I probably could have lumped <em>ML research engineer</em> into one of the <em>ML scientist</em> or <em>ML engineer</em> bins, but given that it was a bit of a hybrid role, I left it as is. </p>
<p>Overall the consolidation made the differences even more pronounced! There are <strong>~70%</strong> more open <em>data engineer</em> than <em>data scientist</em> positions. In addition, there are <strong>~40%</strong> more open <em>ML engineer</em> than <em>data scientist</em> positions. There are also only <strong>~30%</strong> as many <em>ML scientist</em> as <em>data scientist</em> positions. </p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p><em>Data engineers</em> are in increasingly high demand compared to other data-driven professions. In a sense, this represents an evolution for the broader field. </p>
<p>When machine learning become hot 🔥 5-8 years ago, companies decided they need people that can make classifiers on data. But then frameworks like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> became really good, democratizing the ability to get started with deep learning and machine learning. </p>
<p>This commoditized the data modelling skillset. </p>
<p>Today, the bottleneck in helping companies get machine learning and modelling insights to production center on data problems. </p>
<p>How do you annotate data? How do you process and clean data? How do you move it from A to B? How do you do this every day as quickly as possible?</p>

<p>All that amounts to having good engineering skills. </p>
<p>This may sound boring and unsexy, but old-school software engineering with a bend toward data may be what we really need right now. </p>
<p>For years, we’ve become enamored with the idea of data professionals that breathe life into raw data thanks to cool demos and media hype. After all, when was the last time you saw a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> article about an ETL pipeline? </p>
<p>If nothing else, I believe solid engineering is something we don’t emphasize enough in data science job training or educational programs. In addition to learning how to use <em>linear_regression.fit()</em>, learn how to write a unit test too!</p>
<p>So does that mean you shouldn’t study data science? No. </p>
<p>What it means is that competition is going to be tougher. There are going to be fewer positions available for what is looking to be an abundance of newcomers to the market trained to do data science. </p>
<p>There will always be a need for people that can effectively analyze and extract actionable insights from data. But they have to be good. </p>
<p>Downloading a pretrained model off the Tensorflow website on the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html">Iris dataset</a> probably is no longer enough to get that data science job. </p>
<p>It’s clear, however, with the large number of <em>ML engineer</em> openings that companies often want a hybrid data practitioner: someone that can build and deploy models. Or said more succinctly, someone that can use Tensorflow but can also build it from source.</p>
<p>Another takeaway here is that there just aren’t that many ML research positions. </p>
<p>Machine learning research tends to get its fair share of hype because that’s where all the cutting-edge stuff happens, all the <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">GPT-3</a> and what-not. </p>

    <p>While developing the firmware for Winterbloom's <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux">Castor &amp; Pollux</a>, I got very curious as to just what the Microchip/Atmel-provided linker script was doing.</p>
<p>If you've never heard of or seen a linker script before you're not alone. Most of us never even have to think about them, however, on memory constained embedded devices it's not uncommon to need to modify the default linker script.</p>
<p>The linker script controls how <code>ld</code> combines all of your <code>.o</code> files into a single <code>.elf</code> and how that resulting <code>.elf</code> file gets loaded by the target processor.</p>
<p>So I was staring at this script that made absolutely no sense to me. It's filled with incantations and mysterious symbols and there's no indication of what they're for or where they come from.</p>
<p>So I did a <strong>lot</strong> of research and now I can present to you <strong>the most thoroughly commented linker script</strong><sup id="fnref:probably"><a href="#fn:probably">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can see this script in its entirety, comments and all, on <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux/blob/master/firmware/scripts/samd21g18a.ld">GitHub</a>. But if you'd like to read it here instead it's transcribed below.</p>
<h2 id="output-format">Output format</h2>
<p>Output format sets the ELF output format to use a specific BFD backend.</p>
<p>The first is the default BFD. The second and third arguments are used
when big (-EB) or little (-EL) endian is requested.</p>
<p>Since the SAM D series are configured with only little endian support,
"elf32-littlearm" is used across the board. This option seems to be
included by Atmel/Microchip out of an abundance of caution, as
arm-none-eabi-ld will do the right thing and use "elf32-littlearm" by
default.</p>
<p>The list of acceptable values can be obtained using <code>objdump -i</code>.</p>

<p>These variables are used by the following "MEMORY" command to define
the various memory spaces.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21G18A used by this project, the available Flash is
262kB and the available SRAM is 32kB.</p>
<p>This project also reserves 8kB for the bootloader and 1kB for
"non-volatile memory" (NVM) - which is used by the application

<p>ARM Cortex-M processors use a descending stack and generally
require stack space to be set aside in RAM.</p>
<p>The application's behavior determines just how much stack space
should be reserved. I generally start with 2kB (0x800) of
stack space for Cortex-M0+ projects programmed in C .</p>
<p>You can analyze stack usage in GCC using the <code>-fstack-usage</code>
flag and you can enable compiler warnings for stack usage
with <code>-Wstack-usage=STACK_SIZE</code>.</p>

<p>This section declare blocks of memories for specific purposes. Since an
ARM's address space is generally split between Flash, SRAM, peripherals,
and other regions, it's necessary to tell the linker where different
types of data can go in the address space.</p>
<p>These blocks will be used in the <code>SECTIONS</code> command below.</p>

<p>Start with the Flash memory region. On the SAMD21, Flash starts at
the beginning of the address space (<code>0x00000000</code>) and is contiguous
right up to the size of the Flash. Flash is marked a <code>rx</code> so
that the linker knows that this space is read-only (<code>r</code>) and
executable (<code>x</code>).</p>
<p>The "bootloader" section allows this firmware to work with the uf2
bootloader. The bootloader takes the first 0x2000 bytes of flash
memory.</p>

<p>Following the bootloader is the flash memory used by the application,
called "rom" here - even though it's flash, the name is just a name
and doesn't carry special meaning.</p>
<p>The total length of the rom block is the MCU's flash size minus the

<p>The "nvm" block is space set aside for the application to store
user settings and calibration data in the MCU's flash.</p>
<p>The block is located right at the end of the flash space. This
is useful because it means that it says in a fixed location
regardless of how much flash space the application takes up
in "rom". Explicitly defining this section also lets the
linker ensure that application code doesn't overwrite the
data in this region.</p>
<p>This block is marked as read-only (<code>r</code>) because flash can not
be written in the same way as normal memory, however, the
application can use the SAMD's NVM peripheral to write data in
this region.</p>

<p>The "ram" block is mapped to the CPU's SRAM and it's where

<h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
<p>The sections command tells the linker how to combine the
input files into an output ELF and where segments belong
in memory.</p>
<p>The linker takes a set of input files containing the "input
sections" and uses this to map them to "output sections"
which are placed in the output ELF file.</p>
<p>While the most important sections to think about here
are the ones that'll be placed into the memory (segments)
some sections are just placed in the output ELF for debugging.</p>

<p>The vector table defines the initial stack pointer and
interrupt/exception routines for the ARM CPU and device
peripherals. Every Cortex-M project needs this.</p>
<p>For the SAM D series the vector table is expected
to be at address 0x00000000 after reset. Since
flash memory starts at 0x00000000, the first values
in flash should be the vector table.</p>
<p>When defining the vector table in code you must use
<code>__attribute__ ((section(".vectors")))</code> to tell
GCC to place the vector table into the section
named ".vectors" in the input object file so that
the linker can find it.</p>
<p>Note that since this project uses the UF2 bootloader,
this actually gets placed at the beginning of the
program's flash area (0x2000). The Cortex-M allows
changing the vector table after initialization,
so the startup script sets the Vector Table Offset
Register (<code>SCB-&gt;VTOR</code>) to <code>_sfixed</code> during its
intialization. The <code>_efixed</code> symbol is unused but
included for completeness.</p>

<p>Include code and read-only data sections from all
input files.</p>
<p>By default, GCC places all program code into a section named
".text" and read-only data (such as const static variables) into
a section named ".rodata" in the input object files. This naming
convention is from the ELF ABI specification.</p>
<p>GCC generates three "flavors" of sections in object files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.{section}</code>: the basic section.</li>
<li><code>.{section}.*</code>: sections generated by <code>-ffunction-sections</code> and
<code>-fdata-sections</code> so that each function/data has a unique
section.</li>
<li><code>.gnu.linkonce.{type}.*</code>: sections generated by GCC so the
linker can remove duplicates. Seems to be related to
Vague Linking.</li>

    <div>
                <p>As software developers, we've come a long way... from fighting over limited time slices of lab computing, we've arrived at being able to instantly deploy and run code on servers in hundreds of edge data-centers in cities all over the world. This guide evaluates some of the cloud computing options that have become available over two decades—we'll cover the offerings from the three major cloud providers, along with a few other companies building interesting options. </p><p>The common stages of application development are <em>writing</em> code, <em>packaging</em> code, <em>deploying</em> and <em>running</em> code. In this guide we'll talk about advances in <em>packaging</em>, <em>deploying</em> and <em>running</em> code. We'll also cover the basics of the infrastructure required to connect our applications to the rest of the internet, like load-balancers, request protocols and routing. We <em>won't</em> be looking at databases, data storage, <a href="https://sudhir.io/the-big-little-guide-to-message-queues/">message queues</a>, and other advances here—these are all massive topics that deserve their own separate guides. We'll be looking at three kinds of service providers: <em>IaaS</em> or <em>infrastructure-as-a-service</em>, <em>PaaS</em> or <em>platform-as-a-service</em>, and <em>FaaS</em> or <em>functions-as-a-service</em>. </p><p>An <em><strong>IaaS,</strong></em> or <em>infrastructure-as-a-service</em> system gives you all the basic building blocks necessary to run your application, and asks you to make all the decisions about how your application should run—and also do all the work required to setup, configure, maintain and monitor it. The building blocks might have some loose integrations with each other, but you'll have to do most of the wiring to make them work together. </p><p>A <strong><em>PaaS</em></strong>, or <em>platform-as-a-service</em> system makes a lot of those decisions for you, and does a lot of the work itself. The servers are already configured correctly and high-performance request routing and monitoring is taken care of. Operational maintenance is also handled for you, with the PaaS employing a highly trained team of engineers on a 24/7/365 pager duty schedule to make sure everything is running according to your choices. All you need to do is submit the application, configure it, and make a few strategic choices about how you want things to work. </p><p>A <em><strong>FaaS</strong></em>, of <em>functions-as-a-service</em> system, works very differently. Your application is <em>not</em> a stand-alone system here—it's a smaller piece of code that fits tightly into a much larger framework offered by the FaaS system. It cannot run independently—it needs to follow the technology, dependency, packaging, deployment and execution rules of the FaaS, and it can run only in the context of that FaaS. In exchange for conforming to these tight rules the FaaS offers you something that's very hard, if not impossible, to achieve using any other kind of system. We'll cover what “magic” a FaaS provides, along with what the tradeoffs are and how to reduce their impact on your work. </p><h2 id="simple-iaas">Simple IaaS </h2><p>The simplest way to deploy an application on the cloud is to rent one server and deploy it there. AWS has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a>, Google has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute">Compute Engine</a>—Azure doesn't bother with a marketing department and just puts everyone in sales, so they just call them <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/virtual-machines/">Virtual Machines</a>. As Azure very helpfully points out, these servers are all <em>virtual machines</em>. They're real servers with CPU, RAM, disks and networking installed in a data-center building somewhere, and they're either rented out to you as a whole, or split into smaller sections using <em>virtualization</em> hardware and software—hence the term “virtual” machines. This splitting is invisible to you, the customer—you'll see each virtual section that you rent as a complete, isolated, fully functioning machine. There's a lot of incredible engineering that goes into doing this securely <em>and</em> with high-performance—if you're interested the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/">AWS Nitro System</a> is worth reading up on.</p><p>Your server needs to be reachable on the internet, so the first thing it'll have is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IP address</a>. These are a pretty scarce resource, though—represented as four numbers from 0 to 255, there are only 4,294,967,296 (256 x 256 x 256 x 256) possible addresses, out of which fewer are usable and available. So the cloud providers will usually either give you any available address, or allow you to reserve one—often for free if you're actually using it, but at extra charges if you're squatting without using it. AWS calls this <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html">Elastic IP</a>, and Google calls it “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address">Reserving a static external IP address</a>”, because they're probably in the process of moving everyone from marketing into sales. You probably already guessed what Azure <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/reserved-ip-addresses/">calls it</a>. There's also support rolling out for a newer larger address format called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a> that's four times longer and has more addresses than all the grains of sand on a billion earths—but that will take a little longer before it's fully adopted. We'll revisit IPv6 addressing again when we talk about more interesting deployment options.</p><p>Once we have an IP address, we log into the machine using SSH, install our code <em>package</em>, which can be as simple as a zip file for interpreted languages (like Ruby, Python or PHP), or a specially formatted zip file like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)">JAR</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)">WAR</a> (Java &amp; JVM), or a compiled binary (Go, C++). We then complete the process of <em>deployment</em> by installing any dependencies or language runtimes we need, and run the application with a <a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/understanding-and-using-systemd/">process</a> <a href="http://smarden.org/runit/">manager</a> so it stays running after we log out or restart. </p><p>We can then point a domain name, like <em>www.example.com</em>, at the IP address of our server has using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server">name-servers</a> provided by company that we registered the domain name with. Or we could use the DNS name-servers offered by the cloud providers, which promise better performance all over the world. AWS has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Route53</a> (named after the default port for a DNS name-server, which is 53), Google has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dns">Cloud DNS</a> and Azure just has <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-overview">DNS</a>. Using the cloud providers is helpful because they've got servers deployed all over the word, and DNS speeds make a big difference in how fast your application works for users everywhere. Route53 has a few advantages here—besides just answering the question of which IP address is serving a particular domain name, it also gives you the option to tailor that answer based on where the user is, letting you send them to a deployment that's close to them. This assumes that you have a global application that's deployed in multiple places across the world, of course. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> is also an excellent DNS provider—they also have a deployment offering that we'll cover later.</p><p>Along with some extra work that I really hope you do, like OS firewalls and OS hardening, this completes a basic application server setup on the cloud. The cloud providers helpfully provide services to manage basic network security around your server, like AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">VPC</a>, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls">VPC</a>, or Azure <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/virtual-network/">Virtual Network</a>. All of these will allow you to selectively open and close ports with allow/block rules that be scoped to IP addresses; or scoped to another group of similarly managed servers (often called a <em>security group</em>). There are also pre-hardened cloud-specific OS distributions like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/">Amazon Linux</a> available for free use.</p><p>To see what's going on with your application, or <em>monitor</em> it, you could always log in to the machine and read, or <em>tail</em>, the logs. But there's another building block that cloud companies will give you—a tool to ingest logs, set up alerts and dashboards on them and archive them if necessary. AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">CloudWatch</a>, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/logging">Cloud Logging</a>, and Azure <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview">Monitor</a> all provide these features, usually charging based on the quantity of logs you ingest into them and how long you hold them for. Each of them have different features, but as a starting point it'll make sense to just use whatever is available with your chosen platform. Each platform's logging tool will usually also handle native metrics for you—you'll be able to make a dashboard of server CPU usage, disk utilization, or any other metric that the cloud provider tracks natively. If you need more than this, companies like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>, <a href="https://www.sumologic.com/">Sumo Logic</a>, <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack">Elastic</a> and many others can also help.</p><h2 id="protocols-encryption">Protocols &amp; Encryption</h2><p>Before move on to more complex deployments, it's important to review what kinds of incoming requests our applications might be dealing with in the first place. The common protocols we use are:</p><ul><li><strong>UDP</strong>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">packets</a> of information are sent to an IP address with no expectation of acknowledgement.</li><li><strong>TCP</strong>, which <a href="https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/TCP">builds</a> on <em>UDP</em> to create the concept of a <em>connection</em>, where the sender and receiver work with ordered packets of information that are all acknowledged—this gives the sender and receiver the impression of having a 2-way reliable sequential stream on which to exchange raw bytes.</li><li><strong>HTTP/1</strong>, which <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP">builds</a> on <em>TCP</em> to add the concept of a <em>request</em> and <em>response.</em> A <em>request</em> is sent to a human readable address, called a URL, with <em>headers</em> that act as key-value metadata and an optional <em>body</em> of bytes. Each request gets a response, with the same format of headers and body. Each request &amp; response runs on one TCP connection.</li><li><strong>WebSocket</strong>, which <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket"></a><a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/websockets">builds</a> on TCP to provide a similar 2-way ordered data stream, but instead of raw bytes the protocol allows for distinct messages to be sent. Each message is either received as a whole, or the connection is considered to have failed. WebSocket is a companion protocol to HTTP, and a HTTP connection is often transformed (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism">technically</a> <em>upgraded</em>) into a WebSocket.</li><li><strong>HTTP/2</strong>, which builds on <em>TCP</em> and offers the same features as HTTP/1, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/http-1-1-vs-http-2-what-s-the-difference">but with better</a> performance, connection <em>multiplexing</em> (more than one HTTP request-response exchanges can happen simultaneously on the same TCP connection), header compression, and preemptive data <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/guide-http2-server-push/">pushing</a> from the server.</li><li><strong>gRPC</strong>, which <a href="https://grpc.io/"></a><a href="https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/"></a><a href="https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/">builds</a> on <em>HTTP/2</em> to offer remote procedure calls—a way for clients to call functions on servers, identified by URI, with an input and output exchanged in predetermined binary formats.</li><li><strong>HTTP/3 + QUIC</strong>, which builds on <em>UDP</em> and offers the same features as HTTP/2 but <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/"></a><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http3-the-past-present-and-future/">better</a>.</li><li><strong>TLS/SSL</strong>, which isn't a standalone protocol, but a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/">way to encrypt</a> and secure TCP and all the protocols that are built on it (which is all of them except …</li></ul></div></article></main></div></div></div>

On ne s’entend pas, absolument !" Dans ce document unique en son genre, un Parisien réagit à l'écoute de son propre accent, celui du 14e arrondissement, en 1912. Il est interviewé par le linguiste Ferdinand Brunot. </p><div>
            <p>Cette archive exceptionnelle est l’une des premières interviews sonores, le premier enregistrement d'un échange spontané, non lu. C’est aussi l’une des rares traces de l’accent parisien d’avant-guerre. En 1912, le linguiste Ferdinand Brunot veut enregistrer les dialectes des artisans. Ici, c’est le parler parisien qui l’intéresse, l’accent populaire des différents quartiers de la capitale. Louis Ligabue, tapissier dans le 14e arrondissement, a alors 37 ans, et note déjà l'embourgeoisement de son quartier.</p>

<h2>Le parler d'un pur "Parisien de Paris"</h2>
<p>Le linguiste Ferdinand Brunot, fondateur des "Archives de la parole"&nbsp;en 1911, est l'un des rares universitaires de son temps à s'intéresser à l'enregistrement du français parlé&nbsp;"commun". Pour lui, le "parler parisien" est une forme de dialecte dont il faut garder la trace. Chaque quartier de la capitale est censé présenter ses spécificités linguistiques&nbsp;: on ne parle pas à Montrouge comme à Montmartre. Or pour <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/blog/11052020/quand-un-parisien-entend-pour-la-premiere-fois-le-son-de-sa-voix?mode=desktop">Pascal Cordereix</a>, responsable du service des documents sonores à la BnF, "<em>ce 'dialecte' parisien renvoie lui-même à l’un des plus grands mythes de la linguistique romane parisienne de la fin du XIXe siècle, à savoir le "françien", un supposé dialecte d’Île-de-France dans lequel le français trouverait sa seule origine. On est là au cœur de la construction jacobine de la langue française mise en œuvre après 1870, opposant définitivement français et autres idiomes parlés sur le territoire.</em>"</p>
<p><em>Ferdinand Brunot interviewe Louis Ligabue en 1912&nbsp;:&nbsp;</em></p>


<p>- Vous êtes vraiment, vous monsieur, un Parisien de Paris&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>-</em> Je suis né à Paris même, boulevard Sébastopol et j’ai monté du côté de Montrouge, rue Daguerre. Ensuite, j’ai été avenue d’Orléans. J’ai travaillé dans le quartier constamment. Je ne l’ai jamais quitté du reste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Et vous êtes exclusivement tapissier, alors&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Absolument. (...) et je travaille pour le client personnel (...)</p>
<p>- Vous êtes exclusivement dans la clientèle bourgeoise&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Oui, monsieur.</p>
<p>- Il y a eu beaucoup d’installations de ce côté-là, ce doit être un bon métier&nbsp;?</p>
<p><em>-</em> Ah le quartier a beaucoup gagné. Nous avons depuis quelques années travaillé admirablement.</p>
<p>- J’ai entendu dire que vous n’étiez pas payé très régulièrement...</p>
<p>- Oh vous savez, le 14e est tout à fait spécial. Nous avons de bons clients, de bons bourgeois, et puis régulièrement, on hésite à donner une affaire... Mais quant au règlement, jamais nous ne perdons quoi que ce soit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- On m’avait dit au contraire que rue Alphonse Daudet, il y avait une clientèle peu recommandable...</p>
<p>- Ah dame ! Ça, je m’en réjouis bien !</p>
<h2>Entendre sa propre voix</h2>
<p>Ce document est unique à plus d'un titre&nbsp;: c’est aussi la première fois qu’on entend quelqu’un réagir à ses propos, à sa voix. &nbsp;Dans la foulée de l’interview, Louis Ligabue s’écoute, et s’étonne, toujours en dialoguant avec le linguiste Ferdinand Brunot. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/blog/11052020/quand-un-parisien-entend-pour-la-premiere-fois-le-son-de-sa-voix?mode=desktop">Pascal Cordereix</a>, spécialiste du fonds sonore ancien à la Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF)&nbsp;: "<em>On connaît beaucoup de récits écrits d’un enregistrement et de la surprise du locuteur s’écoutant parler. Mais à notre connaissance, Ferdinand Brunot est le seul, avant longtemps, à avoir l’idée de graver ainsi sur disque les réactions du témoin à l’écoute de sa propre voix.</em>"</p>
<p><strong>Ferdinand Brunot interviewe Louis Ligabue en 1912&nbsp;:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>- Eh bien, vous avez entendu ce que vous avez dit. Vous êtes-vous reconnu&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Oui, parfaitement monsieur !</p>
<p>- N’est-ce pas que c’est bien votre voix&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- C’est parfait, parfait, c’est même très très curieux ! C’est très drôle, il me semble même que c’est extraordinaire que j’aie une voix si traînarde, jamais je ne l’aurais cru ! On ne s’entend pas, absolument !&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Vous n’avez pas la voix traînarde, vous avez tout simplement l’accent de Paris, c’est justement ça que je veux enregistrer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ah ça aujourd'hui j’en suis convaincu, bien des gens m’ont dit des fois&nbsp;: “Comme il traîne ce garçon dans sa conversation”. Ben, je disais non, pourtant, il me semble que c’est tout naturel&nbsp;; mais alors là, vous savez, j’ai un accent presque d’La Villette on dirait…</p>
<p>- La Villette&nbsp;? Ne croyez-vous pas qu’il y a une grande différence justement entre l’accent de La Villette et le vôtre&nbsp;?</p>
<p>- Ah peut-être, je ne sais pas…</p>
<p>- Vous qui êtes de Paris, est-ce que vous ne reconnaissez pas justement quelqu’un qui est de nos arrondissements&nbsp;?</p>
<p>- Ah absolument, si, il y a réellement des différences.</p>
<p>- Quelqu’un qui s’est beaucoup occupé de ça me disait par exemple qu’il reconnaissait du premier coup un habitant du 14e et un habitant de Montmartre.</p>
<p>- Ah peut-être, mais enfin, il me semble que c’est une étude assez sérieuse.</p>
<p>- Oui, il y a des gars qui imitent ça étonnamment et à volonté vous savez, ils se transforment en gens de Montparnasse, ou en gens de Montmartre comme ils veulent.</p>
<p>- Ah oui, on voit ça dans les revues, là, dans les concerts, là&nbsp;; on a des types spéciaux là-dessus.</p>
<p>- Oui. Est-ce que dans la rue de la Gaîté, là, il y a des gens qui imitent justement l’accent du quartier&nbsp;?</p>
<p>- Ah y en a, y en a. Mais alors, ça devient peut-être un peu en exagération. Tandis que là, moi, je cause naturellement, et quand j’écoute, il me semble que j’exagère… Je suis bien content, vous savez, d’avoir jugé et ça m’a bien intéressé !</p>
<p>- Et bien je vous remercie de vous être prêté à l’expérience.</p>
<p>- De rien.</p>

<div>
<div>

<p>There are plenty of articles explaining why the Python GIL (The Global Interpreter Lock) exists<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, and why it is there. The TLDR version is: the GIL prevents multithreaded pure Python code from using multiple CPU cores.</p>
<p>However, in <a href="https://vaex.io/">Vaex</a> we execute most of the CPU intensive parts in C (C++) code, where we release the GIL. This is a common practice in high-performance Python libraries, where Python acts merely as a high-level glue.</p>
<p>However, the GIL needs to be released explicitly, and this is the responsibility of the programmer and might be forgotten, leading to suboptimal use of your machine.</p>
<p>I recently had this issue in <a href="https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/pull/1114">Vaex</a> where I simply forgot to release the GIL and found a similar issue in <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/7756">Apache Arrow</a><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, when running on 64 cores, I sometimes see a performance in Vaex that I am not happy with. It might be using 4000% CPU, instead of 6400% CPU, which is something I am not happy with. Instead of blindly pulling some levers to inspect the effect, I want to understand what is happening, and if the GIL is the problem, why, and where is it holding Vaex down.</p>

<p>I'm planning to write a series of articles explaining some tools and techniques available for profiling/tracing Python together with native extensions, and how these tools can be glued together, to analyze and visualize what Python is doing, and when the GIL it taken or dropped.</p>
<p>I hope this leads to improvement of tracing, profiling, and other performance tooling in the Python ecosystem, and the performance of the whole Python ecosystem.</p>

<p>We will make use of <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m">per4m</a></p>

<p>There is no way to get the GIL state in Python <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">1</a></sup> since there is no API for this. We can track it from the kernel, and the right tool for this under Linux is <strong>perf</strong>.</p>
<p>Using the linux perf tool (aka perf_events), we can listen to the state changes for processes/threads (we only care about sleeping and running), and log them. Although perf may look scary, it is a powerful tool. If you want to know a bit more about perf, I recommend reading <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/04/16/new-perf-zine/">Julia Evans' zine on perf</a> or <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html">go through Brendan Gregg's website</a>.</p>
<p>To build our intuition, we will first run perf on a <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/blob/master/per4m/example0.py">very trivial program</a>:</p>


</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>We listen to just a few events to keep the noise down (note the use of wildcards):</p>

<pre><code>$ perf record -e sched:sched_switch  -e sched:sched_process_fork \
        -e 'sched:sched_wak*' -- python -m per4m.example0
[ perf record: Woken up 2 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0,032 MB perf.data (33 samples) ]</code></pre>
<p>And use the <code>perf script</code> command to write human/parsable output.</p>

<p>Take a moment to digest the output. I can see a few things. Looking at the 4th column (time in seconds), we can see where the program slept (it skips 1 second). Here we see that we enter the sleeping state with a line like:</p>
<p><code>python 3040114 [031] 5563911.112513:                sched:sched_switch: prev_comm=python prev_pid=3040114 prev_prio=120 prev_state=S ==&gt; next_comm=swapper/31 next_pid=0 next_prio=120</code></p>
<p>This means the kernel changed the state of the Python thread to <code>S</code> (=sleeping) state.</p>
<p>A full second later, we see it being woken up:</p>
<p><code>swapper     0 [031] 5563912.113697:                sched:sched_wakeup: comm=python pid=3040114 prio=120 target_cpu=031</code></p>
<p>Of course, you need to build some tooling around this, to really see what is happening. But one can imagine this output can be easily parsed and this is what <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/">per4m</a> does. However, before we go there, I'd first like to visualize the flow of a slightly more advanced program using <a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer/">VizTracer</a> is a Python tracer that can visualize what your program does in the browser. Let us run it on a slightly <a href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/per4m/blob/master/per4m/example1.py">more advanced example</a> to see what it looks like.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Running viztracer gives output like:</p>

<pre><code>$ viztracer -o example1.html --ignore_frozen -m per4m.example1
Loading finish

Dumping trace data to json, total entries: 94, estimated json file size: 11.0KiB

<p>From this, it seems that <code>some_computation</code> seem to be executed in parallel (twice), while in fact, we know the GIL is preventing that. So what is really going on?</p>

    <p>The <code>if</code> statement (or <code>if</code> expression) is the cornerstone of every modern programming language - it is so pervasive that we rarely think about how exactly should we use it, or how it is meant to be used. But despite its popularity, <code>if</code> wasnâ€™t always there, and it wasnâ€™t as pervasive as nowadays, so its role is, Iâ€™d argue, still somewhat misunderstood. So in this article, I will examine some mistakes that we can easily avoid in order to improve on our code.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>This is an opinionated text, i.e. it contains my opinions and although I have many arguments that back them, they are ultimately based on <em>my</em> core beliefs about what programming is and should be, so take them as advice, as opposed to a dogma. And here are some of the things on which this advice is based on, structured as postulates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code is for humans (and programmers are humans too).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A form of this appears in a little book known in the hacker community as â€œSICPâ€�, but I donâ€™t know if they were the first to state it. It means that programs are not just instructions for performing a given task - they are text, and as such they should be subject to the same stylistical rules as other text is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code should be as bug-free as possible (and easy to debug as well).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one looks pretty self-explanatory, but the key point is that we have to dedicate effort to make it such, by constantly thinking not only about ways in which the code might go wrong, but also about ways to diagnose potential problems.</p>

<p>I guess I should say something about why I believe these things. Simple - because all other approaches just fail because of the human factor, e.g. any code, that is written without regard for style is bound to become legacy when the person who supports it leaves. Likewise, maintaining code that lacks structure results in bugs (which often can be fixed only by imposing more structure).</p>

<p>Lastly, people often contrast good structure and readability with speed. Firstly, the comparison is a bit unfair, because a well-structured is easier to optimize. And for cases in which it is really the case, in 99% the gain is so little that nobody cares, so the emphasis should remain on readability and structure even then. This is when I would throw this very famous quote by DEK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97 % of the time: pre mature optimization is the root of all evil.
<a href="http://www.kohala.com/start/papers.others/knuth.dec74.html">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that he wrote this when computers were a thousand times slower than today, so we should care about maintainability even more.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, all there was was the assembly language where people didnâ€™t have brackets and had to use <code>jump</code> instructions instead. For those who donâ€™t know what jump does, if you imagine that somewhere in the virtual machine, or the interpreter, that runs your code there is a variable that denotes which line of code should be executed next, then <code>jump</code> is a functionality that basically allows you to set that variable to whatever value you please - it is like a portal that allows you to go to from any place of the program to any other place. For example, a typical <code>if</code> statement that looks like this when written with jumps:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>compare input to waterlevel
if less, jump to A
if equal, jump to B
jump to C

A:
turn motor on
jump to C

B:
turn motor off
C:
...
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40602029/how-to-write-if-else-in-assembly">Source for the assembly pseudocode</a></p>

<p>You can see from this example that, although powerful, jumps are much harder to work with than <code>if</code>-s, although they can sometimes make your code a bit shorter, they will 100% make it less readable which is hardly a good deal - if the important thing is for code to bug free, so youâ€™d always prefer to have a longer and more readable piece of code, than one which is shorter but harder to understand. This realization led to the rise of what was at the time called â€œstructural programmingâ€� paradigm, which was based on the idea that the power of jumps should not be exposed to the programmer - a point which was brought by Edsger W. Dijkstra in the seminal essay <a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a> (<code>goto</code> is the equivalent of a <code>jump</code> instruction statements in non-assembly language context). Simultaneously, the idea of a <em>block</em> (or a â€œcompound statementâ€�) meaning a collection statements that perform a common task (usually denoted today by wrapping them in curly brackets) was pushed forward, and the two ideas gave birth to the <code>if</code> statement that we know today (that <a href="https://craftofcoding.wordpress.com/2017/04/29/the-evolution-of-if-i-from-fortran-i-to-algol-60/">first appeared in the <em>Algol 60</em> programming language</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterlevel) {
  turn motor on
} else if (input equal to waterlevel) {
turn motor off
} else {
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The adoption of structured programming was a long process which began with people even questioning whether structured programs are even capable of encoding all possible computations, but today, although some people are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46586/goto-still-considered-harmful">still defending the use of goto</a>, it (the process) is largely finished - <code>goto</code> is banished and the structured style of programming is so pervasive across modern languages that the term â€œstructuredâ€� is not used any more, simply because there is nothing to contrast it with.</p>

<p>And to reiterate, the reasons for this are quite obvious - using brackets makes our code much more akin to the way we usually talk and write with each other: we often say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œif A then B otherwise Câ€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>we never say things like,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œif A then go to the previous page and start reading from line 12â€�.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I wonder if the programmers who defend the use of <code>goto</code> write and talk like that?)</p>

<p>This already leads me to the first rule that I always follow.</p>



<p>A leftover from the <code>goto</code>-driven style of programming is the possibility of so-called â€œearly exitâ€� - the ability to quit the execution of a given function or method from any place of itâ€™s body (most-oftenly by using the keyword <code>return</code>) as opposed to executing the function to the end. So again if we consider our plain old <code>if</code> <code>else</code> statement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterleve) {
    turn motor on
} else {
    turn motor off
}
...
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Using <code>return</code> we can write it like this</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterleve) {
    return turn motor on
} 
turn motor off
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When used like this, <code>return</code> is directly translatable to a <code>goto</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (input less than waterleve) {
    turn motor on
    Jump to C
}
turn motor off
C:
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why not write like this? We already established that <code>goto</code> is bad and Iâ€™d argue that mixing the two approaches is even worse in some respects, as it might fool you that the code is structured when it really isnâ€™t. Furthermore, the early exit makes our code as confusing as any other <code>goto</code>-containing code when translated to natural language. Imagine someone saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œBring me a coffee if you get home early.â€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and then imagine them saying.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIf you donâ€™t get home early ignore everything Iâ€™d say after this sentence. Bring me a coffee.â€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if your language supports it, always rely on the implicit <code>return</code> instead of explicitly ending your execution. If not, the simple rule you can follow is that you should either return from all branches of the <code>if</code> statement or from none of them.</p>

<h2 id="combining-ifs-with-functions">Combining <code>if</code>â€™s with functions</h2>

<p>The most common type of situation that I have seen the premature <code>return</code> pattern is for handling errors. Imagine for example a very long function with some validation at the beginning. Many people would write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>signup (user) {

  if (username is valid ) {
      throw invalid username
  } 

  create account for user
  sign user up
  initialise some other stuff
  write action in log
  send emails
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a very subtle variant of the issue I am describing (made even more subtle by the fact that <code>throw</code> is used instead of a <code>return</code>). The correct way would be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>signup (user) {

  if (username is valid ) {
      throw invalid username
  } else {
      create account for user
      sign user up
      initialise some other stuff
      write action in log
      send emails
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but people would prefer having the main function code directly in the body in order to avoid indentation (especially if there is a lot of it already). According to them (and they have a point) the error handling is somewhat outside of the domain of the function, we can perhaps say that they are at different levels of abstraction. In cases like this, we should use <em>functions</em> to structure our code and to keep the different levels of abstraction separate.</p>

<p>Functions are everything that random sequences of statement are not and can never be - they <em>have names</em>, they have <em>a separate scope</em> (blocks also have their own scope, but they also inherit the scope of the parent block), and most importantly they are <em>easy to debug</em> (e.g. you have the name of the thing that went wrong right there on the top of the stack trace. So letâ€™s look at how the code above can be made to work with functions. I think this is a very cool and underused pattern that allows you to lose the indentation without sacrificing your structure.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>
signup (user) {
  if (username is valid ) {
      throw invalid username
  } else {
      return signup internal (user)
  }
}

signup internal (user) { // or _signup as some people name it
  create account for user
  sign user up
  initialise some other stuff
  write action in log
  send emails
...
}
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This is another bad pattern that, we might say, has the same root cause as the first one - in their effort to keep things simple and concise, people donâ€™t include all the structure that needs to be there in a robust piece of code.</p>

<p>In <code>if</code> statements we often have to deal with multiple conditions that are dependent on one another. And sometimes in such cases, people try to deal with all of them in one statement with multiple branches and <code>else if</code>-s. I argue that itâ€™s actually better to have <em>one statement per condition</em> …</p></div></div>

                    <p>I started using Signal 5 years ago as I became increasingly conscious of my data footprint. Around the same time, I closed my Facebook and Instagram accounts, and later, my Google Account.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-signal">The problem with Signal</h2><p>Signal makes it very difficult, and in most cases, impossible, for one to back up, export, or migrate message data. The Signal team insists these restrictions are meant to protect users’ privacy. However, backup and migration policies differ for each official Signal client and sometimes contradict each other.</p><p>For example, while iOS offers no official backups process, Android backups are built into the app. At the same time, iOS users can migrate their data to a new device (as long as their phone number hasn’t changed), but this is impossible on Android. Meanwhile, decrypting messages from the desktop client is trivial, but linking one’s phone and desktop client only syncs messages forward in time.</p><h2 id="why-export-signal-s-message-history">Why export Signal's message history</h2><p>Because it’s my fucking data.</p><p>The road to exporting my data was long, frustrating and filled with dead ends – it took over a year to get here. What's paradoxical is that someone else's phone turned out to be the key to my data. </p><p>In recent years, I moved most of my conversations to Signal, including those with family and close friends. Shortly after we started dating, I asked my partner to switch to Signal, and we’ve used it exclusively ever since. At some point, I thought it would be nice to export our conversation history – a sort of time capsule of our relationship. “Easy,” I thought. I was wrong.</p><p>Since we started dating, I had switched from a OnePlus 2 to an iPhone XS Max. And since migrating from Android to iOS isn’t possible, part of our conversation history was locked on my old phone. Jailbreaking the iPhone was out of the question since my version of iOS had not been jailbreaken. The Signal Desktop client could have offered an easy avenue to decrypt our chat history, but there was a period of several months during which I had not linked my iPhone to the Signal desktop client.</p><p>I opened a <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/ios-backups-through-the-desktop-client/8123">thread about this in the Signal Community Forum</a> in June of 2019. It quickly became apparent that backing up my Signal data would be an uphill battle. </p><p>Luckily, my partner had an iPhone 7, which she recently replaced with a company phone. Her old iPhone contained our entire message history in one place and was easy to jailbreak. Jackpot.</p><p>One important lesson I learned during this process:<strong> to ensure access to your conversation history, install the Desktop client and link it to your mobile device as soon as you start using Signal. </strong>The Signal database and encryption key are both accessible on your computer, allowing for easy decryption. Linking the desktop client later will only sync messages forward in time from the moment the devices are linked.</p><h2 id="tips-to-increase-your-chances-of-exporting-your-signal-database">Tips to increase your chances of exporting your Signal database</h2><p>If you haven’t linked the desktop client and extracting the iOS database is your only option, this guide is for you.

Apple only signs firmware updates for a limited time after release. Having these signatures handy allows one to install versions of iOS after Apple stops signing them – like when a jailbreak becomes available for that version. In some cases, you may be able to downgrade iOS to a previous version.</p><p>Backup SHSH blobs every time Apple releases a new version of iOS (e.g., 14.0, 14.1, 14.1.1).

<p>It is January 13th, 2021 as I finish writing these initial words. Major updates may get
a date stamp next to them.</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Someone</em> is sending the directory authorities (and fallback dirs) lots of
traffic.</li>
<li>This causes the dirauths to no longer be able to reliably communicate.</li>
<li>This means consensuses are no longer reliably produced every hour.</li>
<li>No new consensus three hours in a row means new connections to v3 onion
services stop working because of <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237">a bug</a>.  Existing connections survive,
and no other part of Tor breaks at the three hour mark.</li>
<li>There is an <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969">alpha release</a> for <strong>experts who know what they are
doing</strong>.  It is making its way into all supported stable Tor versions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Please keep these facts in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It is unknown if the traffic hitting the dirauths is maliciously
motivated</strong>. People keep calling it an <em>attack</em>. I don't think we have the
evidence to back that up at this time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is no evidence that the traffic overload is actively trying to hurt
v3 onions</strong>.  A <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/33018">similar situation existed last year</a> and onions
didn't go down then. Claims that it is "the" government or rival drug markets
are not backed up with any evidence that I've seen.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you have evidence of who is behind this traffic, please let someone know.
<a href="https://support.torproject.org/get-in-touch/">Tor Project</a> or me
(blog comment, an email <small>(listed on <a href="https://matt.traudt.xyz/posts/about-me-6eKe2i5v/">About
Me</a>)</small>, or IRC message)</p>

<p><small>While I currently work on Tor-related stuff for my job, nothing contained in this
post has anything to do with my work. Everything contained in this post is public unclassified
knowledge. Opinions expressed, if any, are my own.</small></p>



<p>Roger points out on January 6th that
<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2021-January/019201.html">"the overload is back"</a>.</p>

<p>It's not OMGWTFBBQ levels of traffic. It's not from one IP nor is it from IPs
all over the Internet. One dirauth says it <em>seems</em> to be a poorly written
custom Tor client requesting directory information too often.</p>



<p>On January 9th, 10th, and 11th, there are repeated instances of 3 or more
consensuses in a row that are not generated.</p>

<p>This is the trigger for v3 onions no longer working. Consensuses are generated
every hour and are valid for 3 hours. Most parts of Tor (v2 onions, general
circuit building, etc.) do not require a <em>live</em> (currently valid) consensus,
but can get by just fine with a recently valid consensus (expired less than 24
hours ago).</p>

<p>January 12th saw a few missed consensuses, but never 3 in a row. No consensus has been missed so far on the 13th.</p>



<p>The v3 onion service code was written to require a live consensus, and it didn't need to be (devs
are verifying this). The <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2021-January/045681.html">fix</a> for this <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237">bug</a>
changes the requirement to just a recently valid consensus. It's getting tested
as I write these words on January 11th. The fix, or something very similar to
it, will be merged and backported in the coming days, at which point it's up to
the packagers for your OS or your tor-derived software (e.g. Tor Browser) to
notice the update and distribute it to you. I would expect Tor Browser to be updated very quickly.
Debian will probably take a day or two. Other distros, I have no idea.</p>

<p>If you're watching tor's logs, the current date includes "January" and "2021",
and you see the following message, then you have most likely hit the bug.</p>

<pre><code>Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:6697. Giving up. (waiting for rendezvous desc)
</code></pre>

<p>The 6697 is <em>not</em> important. The "waiting for rendezvous desc" <em>is important</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="index1h2"></a>Status of the fix making it into Tor</h2>

<p>Primary sources for this section: <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237">bug #40237</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jan 12th: the fix is merged into 0.4.5.3-rc [<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969">blog post</a>]</li>
</ul>


<p>Upcoming events:</p>

<ul>
<li>backports to other supported versions of Tor</li>
<li>packaging</li>
</ul>




<p>On the 11th we
<a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2021-January/011815.html">notice</a>
the fallback dirs are also failing.
This is major evidence in my opinion that this is not a purposeful attack on the dirauths. I, and at least two dirauths, think it is most likely a bad custom Tor client implementation that requests directory information too often.</p>

<p>We see the same failing of fallback dirs <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2021-January/011840.html">on the 12th</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/dirbytes.html?start=2020-12-01&amp;end=2021-02-01">This graph</a> shows how the entire network is fielding more directory requests these days. <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/dirbytes.html?start=2019-10-01&amp;end=2021-02-01">This graph</a> shows more context for where load usually is. The 1.5 Gbit/s the dirauths saw for ~half of 2020 is talked about in <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/33018">this ticket</a>.</p>

<p>An actual attack could disguise itself like this, but if this were an attack, I would expect it to be more consistently effective at preventing consensus generation.</p>



<p><em>(Last updated 15 Jan 2021)</em></p>

<p>The 14th saw no missing consensuses. If you had trouble reaching v3 onion services on the 14th, your issue is unrelated to the topic of this blog post.</p>

<p>The 15th so far has seen no missing consensuses.</p>



<h2><a name="index2h2"></a>What Tor relays/clients need to be updated?</h2>

<p>No relays need to be updated. Tor clients hosting v3 onion services and Tor clients wishing to visit v3 onion services will need to be updated when the fix is released.</p>

<h2><a name="index3h2"></a>How do I update my Tor?</h2>

<p><em>(Last updated 13 Jan 2021)</em></p>

<p>You don't yet, unless you're willing to compile and use a version of Tor that isn't considered stable yet.
If you're willing, then see <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969">https://blog.torproject.org/node/1969</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="index4h2"></a>Should we temporarily downgrade to v2 while waiting for a fix?</h2>

<p>If absolutely necessary, sure. Please keep in mind v2's issues (briefly described below in the glossary) and be aware that "temporary" probably means ~1 week (<em>crossing my fingers</em>). I personally will just suffer and wait for the fix to be released.</p>

<h2><a name="index5h2"></a>Are v3 onion services fundamentally broken?</h2>

<p>No.</p>

<h2><a name="index6h2"></a>Is this really major?</h2>

<p>Eh ... yes because of the impact, but no because the fix is easy and will be out quickly.</p>



<h2><a name="index7h2"></a>Directory authorities / dirauths</h2>

<p>There are 9 relays operated by highly trusted individuals that decide the state
of the network. They decide what relays are a part of the network and what
certain network parameters should be set to.</p>

<p>In a way they are a "single" point of failure and make the Tor network
"centralized." Decentralizing their role to 100s, 1000s, or every relay would:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>require massive fundamental changes to how Tor works. By itself this
probably is not a convincing reason to not do it.</p></li>
<li><p>open Tor up to new attacks it currently isn't vulnerable to. This should be
a bit more convincing. The keyword to Google for most of them is "Sybil".</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Having a "single" high quality root of trust is a valuable property that
"decentralize all the things!" people do not generally appreciate enough, in my
opinion.</p>

<p>You: <em>This v3 onion fix doesn't actually address the root problem: the dirauths weren't
able to communicate and create consensuses.</em></p>

<p>Yes! You are absolutely right that <em>something</em> about how the dirauths work should
change such that they can continue communicating with each other even in the
presence of malicious (purposefully malicious or not) traffic!
<a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40239">This ticket</a> is one idea and a good place to start your research
if I say nothing more and you want to research what is being done yourself.
They might also update <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/33018">this ticket</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="index8h2"></a>V3 onion service</h2>

<p>The new type of onion service. Names are 56 characters long, like
tv54samlti22655ohq3oaswm64cwf7ulp6wzkjcvdla2hagqcu7uokid.onion. V2 onions are
16 characters long, like 3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion.</p>

<p>V2 onion services use old crypto and old protocols that are obsolete and
dangerous <em>now</em> or will be soon. The code for v2 is messy and the protocol is
not extensible. V2 onions are vulnerable to harvesting by malicious HSDirs, and these malicious HSDirs exist today (and are removed as soon as they are detected).
Support for v2 onion services will be removed from Tor soon. V3 onions are the
future despite the current events.</p>

<h2><a name="index9h2"></a>Fallback directory mirror / fallback dir</h2>

<p>Tor clients don't usually <em>directly</em> fetch consensus information from a dirauth
anymore. There's too many people using Tor and only 9 dirauths. Instead, a
large number of relays that are high quality have opted in to also be hardcoded
into Tor source code so clients can usually fetch consensus data from them on
first run. After first run and successful connection to Tor, clients get this
stuff from their guard instead.</p>

<h2><a name="index10h2"></a>Consensus</h2>

<p>The dirauths vote on what relays are currently in the network and what certain network
parameters should be set to. The "average" of their votes become the consensus.
They make a consensus every hour and each is valid for three hours. Clients typically
fetch a new consensus every two hours.</p>

<p>You can see information from the current consensus <a href="https://consensus-health.torproject.org/">here</a>. Recent consensuses
are archived <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/collector/recent/relay-descriptors/consensuses/">here</a>
and older ones archived <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/collector/archive/relay-descriptors/consensuses/">here</a>.</p>

<p>When the Zig project started, its audience was almost exclusively people with a lot of relevant experience, since those would be the only ones able to evaluate the promise and limits of the newborn language.</p>
<p>Today we’re at a point where Zig is becoming increasingly compelling for people coming from all layers of the stack. People have written <a href="https://github.com/Hejsil/mecha" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">parser combinators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2d game rendering libraries</a>, <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a live editor for GPU shaders</a>, and much more. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: all these projects have been developed by early adopters who wanted to try <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buggy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a new and exciting</a> ecosystem. Zig is not yet stable, and won’t be for a while, but we’re getting there, and in the meantime Zig is already delivering big time on at least one promise: <strong>making it possible to learn more about programming without having to first buy into vast amounts of accidental complexity</strong>.</p>
<p>This redesign had two main goals and, as always, a few practical constraints. When it comes to constraints, it’s mostly my web design and project management skills, and the scope that can be addressed in no more than a couple of months, since we needed a new website <em>now</em> and not one year from now. Let’s now take a look at the goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-friendlier-first-impression"><a href="#a-friendlier-first-impression" aria-label="a friendlier first impression permalink"></a>A friendlier first impression</h2>
<p>The first goal addressed stems directly from the introduction of this blog post: we wanted to make the website more appealing to people that are looking at Zig as an opportunity to learn more about programming. For this reason, the lengthy breakdown has been moved to the Learn section and, in its place, we now have three short paragraphs that highlight some of Zig’s major features, followed by a code sample that gives you a first taste of the syntax. </p>
<p>Above the main introduction we still have the same slogan as before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong>, and <strong>reusable</strong> software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew did an outstanding job at formulating it and I believe it’s the one bit of the entire website that should probably never change.</p>
<p>Next to the slogan there’s a new cluster of buttons. This is where I wanted to come up with an interesting compromise: we follow the popular trend of putting a big call to action for new users, but we also use that block of space to create a single hotspot where regulars can get access to critical information. </p>

<p>My hope is for the big button to make new visitors become aware of that block and that, over time, checking there for docs and new releases just becomes muscle memory. That said, I know we’ll have to tweak the design once the auto-generated docs for the standard library become good enough for the front page.</p>
<p>Below everything I just described, we introduce the community and the Zig Software Foundation. The Zig project has grown to a point where governance matters and we want to show we’re doing everything the right way, up to the point of having formed a <a href="https://ziglang.org/zsf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nonprofit organization with a clear scope and mission statement</a>.</p>
<h2 id="internationalization"><a href="#internationalization" aria-label="internationalization permalink"></a>Internationalization</h2>
<p>The second goal of this redesign was to open the door to hosting multiple translations of the website. Having an i18n-enabled website is beneficial for multiple reasons: it helps with the first goal (i.e. help a wider range of programmers get started with Zig), it’s a good way of getting more use out of the informative materials we’ll progressively add to the website, and it’s also well aligned with the mission of the Zig Software Foundation. Lastly, I’m personally invested in the idea that we must ensure we don’t leave it to third parties to be the sole owners of all content available in a given language, as we’ve already seen bad actors exploit their position to implement a form of cultural arbitrage.</p>
<p>We’re well aware that keeping up with translations to multiple languages can quickly become an effort black hole. For this reason, I’ve tried to make sure the tooling would help in making the process as smooth as possible (more on that later), and I’ve also made sure to clarify in the design how translations are community-provided and thus best-effort.</p>

<p>At the moment of publication, the website can only offer <a href="https://ziglang.org/translations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an Italian translation</a> written by me. Italian was chosen out of necessity (i.e. it’s the only other language I speak), but it served the purpose of making me try out the ergonomics of producing a translation, and it can also act as documentation for others.</p>
<p>Finally, I should point out that there are some parts of the website we don’t plan to translate, like the News section, for example. This is another choice made out of necessity: we want to restrict translations to content with a long shelf life to reduce the amount of effort, but I don’t exclude that one day we might have enough resources to get rid of this compromise.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details"><a href="#implementation-details" aria-label="implementation details permalink"></a>Implementation details</h2>
<p>The new website is statically generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>. I also considered <a href="https://www.getzola.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zola</a>, but its i18n support is not complete yet. The website lists a number of Zig code snippets, with relative output. Andrew originally implemented a program to produce release notes and language reference. That program takes in code samples, applies syntax highlighting, runs the code, and reports the output as HTML (it even retains colors from the terminal). I took the original code and packaged it as a tool with a more general interface. I called it <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zig-doctest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">zig-doctest</a> and it can be easily integrated with all kinds of static content generation tools.</p>
<p>Now a successful CI build of the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ziglang/zig</a> repository triggers a build of the website, allowing us to catch outdated code examples much more easily. This addresses concerns raised in the past by people that would occasionally stumble upon a broken code sample.</p>
<p>Testing all code snippets is not instant as some tests include running the executable and capturing its output, so I made sure to integrate with Hugo’s caching system. I also noticed that Hugo processes tags sequentially within the same page, so I also <a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/hugo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">added to it</a> a warmup routine that makes sure to parallelize the testing when loading the development server the first time.</p>
<p>The result is a very enjoyable development experience that only depends on Zig and two additional executables (Hugo and doctest) to be able to develop the Zig website locally, resulting in an acceptable experience for potential contributors. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post explains adequately the intent of this work and the practical limits of its execution. There’s still more work to do, but this seems a reasonable milestone for a first release, so I’m looking forward to working alongside the community to improve and add translations to the website.</p>
<p>For the next iteration I’ll work on improving accessibility, but first I have to focus on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/zig_programming_language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FOSDEM, since we have a Zig dev room</a> and I have a bunch of duties to attend to. </p>
<p>When I first discovered Zig, I saw it as a way for me to learn more about all the aspects of programming I missed when working with interpreted and/or garbage-collected languages. Turns out I got to learn that <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">and much more</a>, and I can’t tell you how excited I am about what’s to come. Despite everything, 2020 was a great year for Zig, and I fully expect 2021 to be even better.</p></div></div>]]>

		<p>How I removed google analytics and still have good data to analyze. It was just recently, that I opened my google analytics account and added it to this website. I wanted to get some insights, about my website’s visitors. But compared to the google search console, there was not much information interesting to me. </p>
<p>And actually I worried a little. Is it legal to just add analytics? analytics was easy to add, just adding a script tag into my page. In EU it is needed to inform the user about non essential cookies. Before setting one, it is needed to ask the users consent. However, analytics got added using a static html tag and there is no way to control what cookies are set immediately.</p>
<p>I was not sure if I should create that script tag dynamically after asking the user, using some client side javascript. and would analytics still work?</p>
<p>On the internet when searching for analytics without cookies there are many websites advising to use <code>motomo</code>. It is a very good solution made with php and mysql. But for my little blog setting up this server seem a little to much. Also because I would have to look that I keep it up do date and do some more security measures. For real production application, google analytics and <a href="https://matomo.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">motomo</a>, both will be a better choice recording lots of data you don’t know now you want to have in the future.</p>
<p>I added a little script into my website. Instead of cookies it uses local storage. local storage can not be used to track users across other websites. So I think this should comply with the law. Also in the storage there is nothing stored to identify the user.</p>

<p>On the server I just dump this information into a jsonl file, meaning one json log entry each line. It can easily be converted to csv for analyses via <code>excel</code>. Draw some charts or count per interval weekly and monthly interval. </p>

<p>Do you see, that I do not check if the browser supports the <code>fetch</code> API and modern arrow functions? I was thinking about it, and decided that I don’t need to care about old browser compatibility for this optional feature.</p>
<p>You see all the fields that are getting stored. These are what I came up with. That I think are interesting. To be honest, the API shown is not exactly the one running at tnickel.de, but the concept is this. On my running implementation I validate the received data, store urls and user agent string into a separate <a href="http://tnickel.de/2020/11/20/2020-11-rapid-prototyping-with-json-file-database/">json file database</a> and write the id into the log file. But with this example you can understand how you can implement the server side yourself.</p>
<p>As by chance: The dev.to community, was just asked about analytics tools. And I described my little solution. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dev.to/madza/what-web-analytics-tools-do-you-use-458o">comment</a> received a reply by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://charanj.it/">Charanjit Chana</a>, saying he is using a similar solution, here is what I found on his websites source code (it was minified, so I formatted it a little):</p>

<p>Seems as head of development he is interested in finding new developer talents for his team. I like the <code>allowToTrack</code> function used before the analytics request is made. This request then set a cookie, so multiple page views can be related to the same user and session. I don’t know about the rules in England after it left the EU, but I believe in Germany, an additional popup banner would be needed. Other than me, Charanjit is interested in the users screen resolution to know what to optimize the page for.</p>
<p>You now have seen two valid approaches to building the client side for collecting analytics information. With this article, I hope you find how how this website does analytics, without tracing the users all over the internet and even into their darkest dreams.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Inline caching is a popular technique for runtime optimization. It was first
introduced in 1984 in Deutsch &amp; Schiffman’s paper <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs232/papers/DeutschSchiffman-popl84.pdf">Efficient implementation
of the smalltalk-80 system [PDF]</a> but has had a long-lasting legacy in
today’s dynamic language implementations. Runtimes like the Hotspot JVM, V8,
and SpiderMonkey use it to improve the performance of code written for those
virtual machines.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will attempt to distill the essence of inline caching
using a small and relatively useless bytecode interpreter built solely for this
blog post. The caching strategy in this demo is a technique similar to the
ideas from <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/kps09/pdfs/brunthaler.pdf">Inline Caching meets Quickening [PDF]</a> in that it
caches function pointers instead of making use of a JIT compiler.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In many compiled programming languages like C and C++, types and attribute
locations are known at compile time. This makes code like the following fast:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "foo.h"
</span>
<span>Foo</span> <span>do_add</span><span>(</span><span>Foo</span> <span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>right</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>right</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compiler knows precisely what type <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> are (it’s <code>Foo</code>) and
also where the method <code>add</code> is in the executable. If the implementation is in
the header file, it may even be inlined and <code>do_add</code> may be optimized to a
single instruction. Check out the assembly from <code>objdump</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>0000000000401160 &lt;_Z6do_add3FooS_&gt;:
  401160:	48 83 ec 18          	sub    $0x18,%rsp
  401164:	89 7c 24 0c          	mov    %edi,0xc(%rsp)
  401168:	48 8d 7c 24 0c       	lea    0xc(%rsp),%rdi
  40116d:	e8 0e 00 00 00       	callq  401180 &lt;_ZN3Foo3addES_&gt;
  401172:	48 83 c4 18          	add    $0x18,%rsp
  401176:	c3                   	retq   
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All it does is save the parameters to the stack, call <code>Foo::add</code>, and then
restore the stack.</p>

<p>In more dynamic programming languages, it is often impossible to determine at
runtime startup what type any given variable binding has. We’ll use Python as an
example to illustrate how dynamism makes this tricky, but this constraint is
broadly applicable to Ruby, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<p>Consider the following Python snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>do_add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>right</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Due to Python’s various dynamic features, the compiler cannot in general know
what type <code>value</code> is and therefore what code to run when reading <code>left.add</code>.
This program will be compiled down to a couple Python bytecode instructions
that do a very generic <code>LOAD_METHOD</code>/<code>CALL_METHOD</code> operation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis("""
... def do_add(left, right):
...     return left.add(right)
... """)
[snip]
Disassembly of &lt;code object do_add at 0x7f0b40cf49d0, file "&lt;dis&gt;", line 2&gt;:
  3           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (left)
              2 LOAD_METHOD              0 (add)
              4 LOAD_FAST                1 (right)
              6 CALL_METHOD              1
              8 RETURN_VALUE

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> Python bytecode instruction is unlike the x86 <code>mov</code>
instruction in that <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> is not given an offset into <code>left</code>, but
instead is given the name <code>"add"</code>. It has to go and figure out how to read
<code>add</code> from <code>left</code>’s type — which could change from call to call.</p>

<p>In fact, even if the parameters were typed (which is a new feature in Python
3), the same code would be generated. Writing <code>left: Foo</code> means that <code>left</code> is a
<code>Foo</code> <em>or</em> a subclass.</p>

<p>This is not a simple process like “fetch the attribute at the given offset
specified by the type”. The runtime has to find out what kind of object <code>add</code>
is. Maybe it’s just a function, or maybe it’s a <code>property</code>, or maybe it’s some
custom descriptor protocol thing. There’s no way to just turn this into a
<code>mov</code>!</p>

<p>… or is there?</p>

<h2 id="runtime-type-information">Runtime type information</h2>

<p>Though dynamic runtimes do not know ahead of time what types variables have at
any given opcode, they do eventually find out <em>when the code is run</em>. The first
time someone calls <code>do_add</code>, <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> will go and look up the type of
<code>left</code>. It will use it to look up the attribute <code>add</code> and then throw the type
information away. But the second time someone calls <code>do_add</code>, the same thing
will happen. Why don’t runtimes store this information about the type and the
method and save the lookup work?</p>

<p>The thinking is “well, <code>left</code> could be any type of object — best not make any
assumptions about it.” While this is <em>technically</em> true, Deutsch &amp;
Schiffman find that “at a given point in code, the receiver is often the same
class as the receiver at the same point when the code was last executed”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> By <em>receiver</em>, they mean the thing from which the attribute is
being loaded. This is some Object-Oriented Programming terminology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is huge. This means that, even in this sea of dynamic behavior, humans
actually are not all that creative and tend to write functions that see only a
handful of types at a given location.</p>

<p>The Smalltalk-80 paper describes a runtime that takes advantage of this by
adding “inline caches” to functions. These inline caches keep track of variable
types seen at each point in the code, so that the runtime can make optimization
decisions with that information.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at how this could work in practice.</p>

<h2 id="a-small-example">A small example</h2>

<p>I put together a <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/icdemo">small stack machine</a> with only a few operations. There
are very minimal features to avoid distracting from the main focus: inline
caching. Extending this example would be an excellent exercise.</p>

<h3 id="objects-and-types">Objects and types</h3>

<p>The design of this runtime involves two types of objects (<code>int</code>s and <code>str</code>s).
Objects are implemented as a tagged union, but for the purposes of this blog
post the representation does not matter very much.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>kInt</span><span>,</span>
  <span>kStr</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>ObjectType</span><span>;</span>

<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ObjectType</span> <span>type</span><span>;</span>
  <span>union</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>str_value</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>int_value</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Object</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These types have methods on them, such as <code>add</code> and <code>print</code>. Method names are
represented with an enum (<code>Symbol</code>) though strings would work just as well.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>kAdd</span><span>,</span>
  <span>kPrint</span><span>,</span>

  <span>kUnknownSymbol</span> <span>=</span> <span>kPrint</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The representation of type information isn’t super important. Just know that
there is a function called <code>lookup_method</code> and that it is very slow. Eventually
we’ll want to cache its result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Method</span> <span>lookup_method</span><span>(</span><span>ObjectType</span> <span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>name</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see how we use these <code>lookup_method</code> in the interpreter.</p>

<h3 id="interpreter">Interpreter</h3>

<p>There’s no way to call these methods directly. For the purposes of this demo,
the only way to call these methods is through purpose-built opcodes. For
example, the opcode <code>ADD</code> takes two arguments. It looks up <code>kAdd</code> on the left
hand side and calls it. <code>PRINT</code> is similar.</p>

<p>There are only two other opcodes, <code>ARG</code> and <code>HALT</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>enum</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Load a value from the arguments array at index `arg'.</span>
  <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Add stack[-2] + stack[-1].</span>
  <span>ADD</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Pop the top of the stack and print it.</span>
  <span>PRINT</span><span>,</span>
  <span>// Halt the machine.</span>
  <span>HALT</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Opcode</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Bytecode is represented by a series of opcode/argument pairs, each taking up
one byte. Only <code>ARG</code> needs an argument; the other instructions ignore theirs.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a sample program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>byte</span> <span>bytecode</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>/*0:*/</span> <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>   <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*2:*/</span> <span>ARG</span><span>,</span>   <span>1</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*4:*/</span> <span>ADD</span><span>,</span>   <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*6:*/</span> <span>PRINT</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                   <span>/*8:*/</span> <span>HALT</span><span>,</span>  <span>0</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program takes its two arguments, adds them together, prints the result,
and then halts the interpreter.</p>

<p>You may wonder, “how is it that there is an instruction for loading arguments
but no call instruction?” Well, the interpreter does not support calls. There
is only a top-level function, <code>eval_code</code>. It takes an object, evaluates its
bytecode with the given arguments, and returns. Extending the interpreter to
support function calls would be another good exercise.</p>

<p>The interpreter implementation is a fairly straightforward <code>switch</code> statement.
Notice that it takes a representation of a function-like thing (<code>Code</code>) and an
array of arguments. <code>nargs</code> is only used for bounds checking.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>byte</span><span>;</span>

<span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Both <code>ADD</code> and <code>PRINT</code> make use of <code>lookup_method</code> to find out what function
pointer corresponds to the given <code>(type, symbol)</code> pair. Both opcodes throw away
the result. How sad. Let’s figure out how to save some of that data. Maybe we
can use the <code>caches</code> slot in <code>Code</code>.</p>

<h3 id="inline-caching-strategy">Inline caching strategy</h3>

<p>Since the Smalltalk-80 paper tells us that the receiver type is unlikely to
change from call to call at a given point in the bytecode, let’s cache <em>one</em>
method address per opcode. As with any cache, we’ll have to store both a key
(the object type) and a value (the method address).</p>

<p>There are several states that the cache could be in when entering the an
opcode:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>If it is empty</strong>, look up the method and store it in the cache using the
current type as a cache key. Use the cached value.</li>
  <li><strong>If it has an entry and the entry is for the current type</strong>, use the cached
value.</li>
  <li>Last, <strong>if it has an entry and the entry is for a different …</strong></li></ol></div></div>

							<p>Amazon puts obstacles in the way of consumers who wish to unsubscribe from its Amazon Prime service. Today the Norwegian Consumer Council filed a legal complaint against the company for breaches of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.</p><p>In the process of unsubscribing from Amazon Prime, the company manipulates consumers to continue using the service in what seems like a deliberate attempt to confuse and frustrate customers.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council`s <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/complaint-against-amazon-prime.pdf">legal complaint</a>&nbsp;to the Consumer Protection Authority highlights what we believe to be Amazon´s unfair commercial practices and breaches of marketing law.</p>
<p>– It should be as easy to end a subscription as it was to subscribe in the first place. Amazon should facilitate a good user experience instead of hindering customers and tricking them into continuing paid services they do not need or want, said Director of Digital Policy at the Norwegian Consumer Council, Finn Lützow-Holm Myrstad.</p>
<p>– In our view, this practice not only betrays the expectations and trust of consumers but breaches European law.</p>
<h2><strong>One out of four consumers struggle to unsubscribe </strong></h2>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/population-survey-digital-content.pdf">surveyed 1,000 Norwegian consumers</a> and analysed their experience. One out of four Norwegian consumers reported difficulties unsubscribing from digital content services. Twenty-five percent of consumers surveyed reported that they pay for one or more subscriptions that they use with such infrequency that they might as well end the subscription.</p>
<p>– Most of us use digital content services to watch movies, listen to music or audiobooks, play video games, or read the news. At the same time, many consumers experience issues with subscriptions being very easy to sign up for, but difficult to get out of, said Finn Myrstad.</p>
<p>– Companies such as Amazon seem to speculate that they can discourage customers from cancelling their subscriptions either by heavily emphasizing the benefits that will be lost upon cancellation or by making the process so complicated that its users simply give up.</p>
<h2><strong>Amazon manipulates users into staying by using dark patterns</strong></h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GpEQ4OWNO4Y" width="650" height="433" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-14-you-can-log-out-but-you-can-never-leave-final.pdf">The Norwegian Consumer Council’s study</a> analysed the cancellation process for Amazon Prime. The analysis shows that consumers who want to leave the service are faced with a large number of hurdles, including complicated navigation menus, skewed wording, confusing choices, and repeated nudging. Throughout the process, Amazon manipulates users through wording and graphic design, making the process needlessly difficult and frustrating to understand.</p>
<p>– Unfortunately, using <em>dark patterns</em>, or manipulative design, is a common practice online. Consumers are constantly bombarded by a variety of subtle and less subtle attempts to push us into making choices that favour the companies at the cost of our own time, attention, and money, said Myrstad.</p>
<h2><strong>A global problem requires global solutions</strong></h2>
<p>16 different consumer organizations in Europe and the United States are now taking action against Amazon based on the report by the Norwegian Consumer Council. They will each ask their respective consumer authorities to investigate the use of dark patterns in their countries.</p>
<p>This international campaign builds upon the Norwegian Consumer Council’s joint 2018 campaign with seven other European consumer organizations against Google’s use of dark patterns. The complaint, which the Irish Data Protection Commissioner’s office is still investigating, uncovered how Google manipulates users into turning on comprehensive location tracking.</p>
<p>– The Consumer Protection Authority can set an important precedent by issuing a decision against Amazon. A decision in favour of the complaint would mark that the use of dark patterns is not in accordance with European law and would elevate the rights of consumers.</p>

			<hr><p><strong>Amazon Prime</strong></p>
<p>A subscription to Amazon Prime provides discounts, shipping benefits, and access to other Amazon services. The Amazon Prime service has more than 150 million subscribers worldwide. Amazon’s European headquarters is in Luxembourg.</p>
<p><strong>Dark patterns</strong></p>
<p>Dark patterns, or manipulative design, are features of user interface design that nudge or push consumers into making choices that are in the best interest of the service provider, rather than in the interest of the consumer. This may include that certain options are easier to choose than others, that consumers are tricked into giving consent to sharing personal data, and many other practices.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not a “systems” person.</p>
<p>It’s not like I never tried - making schedules, using a Pomodoro timer,&lt;insert productivity “hack”&gt; - they didn’t work because I was trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104540572-bb4c3d00-5645-11eb-86f9-de27e6b8d07d.jpg" alt="square_peg.jpg"> <small> <a href="https://baddadcartoons101.wordpress.com/2017/09/04/square-peg-and-a-round-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i> Source: BadDadCartoons </i> </a> </small> </p>
<p>What I ended up doing was instead of focusing on optimising the time I spent productively - i.e. the “deep work” part (which happened rather spontaneously independent of whether I’m on a productivity hack or not) - I decided to focus on the time that was not “deep work” i.e. time spent on ‘distractions’ or entertainment.</p>
<p>I used to spend an unhealthy amount of time in a day on Instagram where the feed was mostly filled with memes. I also used Quora/Twitter a lot.</p>
<p>Consuming content is easy. Like junk food. It's almost embedded in our reflexes.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing - you can easily turn your distractions to things that can benefit you.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Start with cutting off distractions that have too much noise i.e. do not give you a good return of investment on your time in any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific knowledge/skills</li>
<li>Specific insight</li>
<li>Accessing and leveraging a network</li>
</ul>
<p>For the ones that remain, optimise the shit out of them.</p>
<p>For me, that meant Instagram was instantly off the list. Twitter and Quora were okay, but I had a long way to go.</p>
<br>
<h3> Optimising your feed </h3>
<p>Social media “feed”.
What comes to your mind when you think of the word - “feed”?</p>
<p>This comes to my mind when I think “feed”</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541024-c0f65280-5646-11eb-92f6-de5227d4b8a1.png" alt="sheep.jpg"> <i> <small> Sheep, “feed”ing </small>
</i> </p>
<p>Our minds are literally “fed” content.</p>
<p>“We are what we eat” - this doesn’t just stand for physical, tangible food - it applies to the digital content we feed our mind with.</p>
<p>I want you to take this literally because we take our attention for granted. In a digital economy run by monetising attention - it will naturally be full of noise.</p>
<p>Most of the content we read or watch is optimised solely for capturing our attention and clicks. More times than not, you don’t need something that is being shown to you. You will be perfectly fine without knowing it existed. Yep, sounds crazy but it is true.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to say social media is bad. Social media is an amplifier of all there is - of both the good stuff and the bad. It is an amplifier of your primal instincts so if you don’t proactively weed out the bad stuff from your feed regularly, you are going to get sick. Really sick.</p>
<p>What that means is, with some conscious effort you can filter out your feed to keep only the things that benefit you. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Tip #1</strong></p>
<p>Don’t follow brands. Follow people.</p>
<p>I’ll bring the sheep here, again.</p>
<p>When I imagine a brand account, I imagine the shepherd.</p>
<p>And all of the 100-200-500k followers as the sheep.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541200-1599cd80-5647-11eb-8d7f-f89ae517eb81.png" alt="shepherd.jpg"></p><p>The only reason brand accounts exist is to convince you - in obvious or non-obvious ways - that you need their product in some way or the other. 99-100% of brand accounts posts are pure marketing. You do not need them.
It’s like bombarding your own feed with their ads - full time - <em>with your full consent</em>. Especially so if you are already consuming a brand’s product. Why?!</p>
<p>Who should you follow then?</p>
<p>Follow people. Now, you might argue that people themselves can be brands and you are absolutely right - avoid them too. This goes for popular celebrities, sportspeople, singers etc.
Around half the time, you are probably going to see marketing stuff from them as well. Not all are like that of course, apply your judgement. I respect a lot of celebrities but I don’t follow them because I simply don’t need their opinion in my feed - I couldn’t care any less - they are artists, I liked their art, I liked how they performed but that doesn’t mean I like their opinion nor do I need to listen to them on every single issue there is. At the end of the day, including every celebrity or band or anything in your feed just increases the “distraction” score in your feed.</p>
<p>Okay. Brands are out. Brand people are out. What next?</p>
<p>Follow thinkers. Follow do-ers. Follow people who are creating something.</p>
<p>Some follows I would recommend in no particular order:
<a href="https://twitter.com/naval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @naval </a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @nntaleb </a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @JamesClear </a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/Kpaxs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
@Kpaxs </a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/ArmaniTalks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @ArmaniTalks </a> ,

<a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> @David_Perell </a>,</p>
<p>This is a subjective list, of course, but the idea remains the same: when you scroll - scroll to think, not to react. The posts/tweets in your feed should stop and make you think. If they enable <em>only</em> a reaction like rage or anxiety - remove it.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A simple heuristic to clean your social media feed:</p><p>Scroll to think, not to react</p><p>Reduce content that enables only a reaction. <br>Increase content that stops and makes you think.</p></div>— Akhil (@akhlkg) <a href="https://twitter.com/akhlkg/status/1346891698861862913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2021</a></blockquote> 

<p><strong>Tip #2</strong></p>
<p>When something is trending and it doesn’t really matter to you much, mute all the words/hashtags/etc related to it. The “Explore” section in Twitter is a black hole of distractions. Twitter will try to shove you up with random stuff all the time in your feed - but mute/block/ignore them all - this takes conscious effort but is well worth it.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/104541285-5691e200-5647-11eb-93d6-ed60a6cfa293.png" alt="twet.jpg"></p><p>If it's a trending event you do genuinely care about and you must “react” to it - here’s my two step strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ignore ‘the first wave’</strong></p>
<p>The first wave is the most emotional one. The purpose of the first wave, knowingly or unknowingly, is to polarise. There is no place for rationality in the first wave of posts, trends, articles, etc. You are likely going to see the same type/flavour of content - over and over from all sorts of people which essentially just convey the same thing in different shades of rage. There is nothing against the stream, yet. Mute ‘em all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assess the aftermath</strong></p>
<p>Once the first wave is gone and the hashtags die, start looking around. This can be anywhere from 1 week to several months depending on the issue. You are searching for truth, so don’t look at the news - if you’re reading articles online, don’t just look at one publisher, read on the same article by different publishers. Remember, each publishing house has a “flavour” of twisting things. An easy way to cancel the bias out is to read from many publishers and see what remains common. Now analyse the common facts - those are the fundamental facts that supposedly happened and anything above that, is just an opinion.</p>
<p>You can also look if the “thinkers” are reacting. If so, see what they are saying.
It takes effort to get to the truth and navigate through the noise, so I don’t end up doing this a lot of times because I simply didn't care about the event as much as I thought. And it looks like I end up doing okay.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<p>That’s about it. In theory, you can apply these principles to any social media platform. I tested and developed these on Twitter but the fundamental idea remains the same: <strong>scroll to think, not to react.</strong></p>
<p>And this fundamental idea helped me a lot. Twitter taught me a lot of things that form a core part of who I am now - staying healthy, strength training, mental models, entrepreneurship, making money online, writing.</p>
<p>You can use your distractions to literally change your life - and I really hope you do!</p></div></div>]]>

Many universities agree on the answer: “Absolutely nothing.”</p><p>Although anthropologists and archeologists still wonder why human beings have for so long organized themselves to fight, the study of war in history and political science departments is fading. Senior scholars are retiring and not being replaced, or their posts are allocated to other fields of history. Each year, fewer courses are offered on great conflicts such as the Napoleonic wars, the total wars of the 20th century, and the Cold War. The Second World War, you may hear on campus, “has been done.”</p><p>Yet war remains one of the events—along with revolution, famine, financial collapse and, as we are learning again, pandemics—that change the course of history. In privileged countries, we forget the importance of military conflicts because we have enjoyed the “Long Peace” that followed the Second World War. Other places have not been so fortunate, with wars around the world almost every year since 1945, bringing millions of deaths and creating millions more refugees. Meanwhile, the world’s great powers maintain large military establishments, and still prepare for battle. </p><p>It is as important as ever to understand war—its causes, nature and consequences—and the many ways that conflicts have shaped our societies. The conquering armies that came from the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century after the Prophet Mohammad’s death created new empires and spread the new religion of Islam across the Middle East, North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. The Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), a global conflict, laid the foundations for the dominance of the British Empire and the bankruptcy of France, which helped to fuel the French Revolution.&nbsp; </p><p>War can also speed up advances in science and technology that have benefits in peacetime. Think of the development of penicillin, blood transfusions, radar, or the transistor. And war can bring about significant social change, often for the better. The need for mass armies in the 19th and 20th centuries meant that governments had to treat the lower classes better, whether by educating them or by improving public health. In many countries that fought in the two world wars, ruling classes recognized the contributions of women and the working classes, granting them the franchise and introducing social benefits. </p><p>So why do history faculties, which accept the need to study other great forces in history, such as changes in the means of production or systems of belief, shy from war? I suspect that horror at the phenomenon itself has affected universities’ willingness to treat it as a subject for scholarship. Years ago, when I proposed a new course on war and society, an education consultant asked me, “Why don’t you call it peace studies?” </p><p>I have since met with incomprehension, even hostility, when I have pointed out that wars can bring unintended benefits. However much I say that we would not <em>choose</em> to make war in order to improve our societies, I am charged with loving war. Yet nobody would say that the study of imperialism, racism or famine means that we think those are good things.</p><p><strong>The history of war is neglected for other reasons, too. </strong>First, separate histories—of women, emotions, food and the environment, for example—have come along. Quite rightly, room has been made for them in the big and eclectic house that is the study of the past. However, part of the shift away from war studies owes to the quest for “social justice”—intended as a drive for radical change in society at large—that has taken root in many history faculties. </p><p>Here, for example, is how the chair of Historical and Cultural Studies at the Scarborough campus of the University of Toronto, Natalie Rothman, <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/hcs/">welcomed students</a> this autumn: “As a department, we have strengthened our resolve to confront racism, colonialism and Islamophobia throughout our curriculum and in our co-curricular initiatives.” The University of Berkeley in California <a href="https://history.berkeley.edu/graduate/prospective-students/admissions">asks prospective graduate students</a> to provide “evidence of how you have come to understand the barriers faced by others, evidence of your academic service to advance equitable access to higher education for women, racial minorities, and individuals from other groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education, evidence of your research focusing on underserved populations or related issues of inequality, or evidence of your leadership among such groups.” It is hard to quarrel with such goals, but their impact on curriculum has been to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/opinion/why-did-we-stop-teaching-political-history.html?smid=em-share">downgrade subjects such as political and military history,</a> which are seen as too focused on elites and complicit with hierarchy and oppression. </p><p>Another factor is that history overall is worryingly in decline as an academic subject. While it remains popular among publishers and readers, enrollments in history majors are significantly down. They have <a href="https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2018/the-history-ba-since-the-great-recession-the-2018-aha-majors-report">dropped more than any other major</a> in the humanities—perhaps by as much as <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/why-are-students-ditching-the-history-major">one-third</a> in <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/11/27/new-analysis-history-major-data-says-field-new-low-can-it-be-saved">American universities</a> in the past decade. At the University of Toronto, where I am a professor, colleagues fear that history enrollment may be down as much as 50% over the same period. Even in the United Kingdom, where history remains popular among undergraduates, the number of those majoring in history has dropped by about <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/07/18/the-study-of-history-is-in-decline-in-britain">one-tenth</a> in the past decade. </p><p>Part of the reason is that, given the lingering effects of the 2008 financial crisis and uncertainty over the economy, students and their parents want university courses to lead to jobs. The decline in history students in turn affects university hiring, and the fewer the tenured faculty, the fewer places for the doctoral students who are the future of the profession.&nbsp; </p><p>Faculties and administrators are not necessarily helping matters, reluctant to include popular courses on war in the curriculum, or to support well-established centers for the study of conflict, some of which are being remodeled, such as the Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic and Disarmament Studies, in Waterloo, Ontario, which will focus more on Canadian history; another at the University of Calgary is fading as those who retire are not replaced. This seems to be particularly true of elite universities. War studies remains in better health at military colleges or some second-tier public universities, while schools of public policy are also still teaching military history, strategic studies and diplomatic history. </p><p>But those in other fields stereotype war studies, characterizing it as too narrowly focused on tactics, battles, or “toys for boys,” meaning armaments. If that caricature were ever true, it has not been for decades. The great historian Sir Michael Howard, who pioneered the modern study of war and trained generations of historians, always insisted that what he was doing was to consider wars within their social and political contexts as a part of the great sweep of history, not somehow separate from it. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>My own evidence of the distaste for military and diplomatic history </strong>at North American universities comes from tales exchanged privately among fellow academics. One retired Canadian military historian recounted that his old faculty had asked him how to reverse the collapse in enrollment. He suggested a course in military history, but the response was a flat no. When a university in the Maritime provinces of eastern Canada was offered a fully funded post in naval history a few years ago—a good fit in a port town that had been deeply affected by conflict on the Atlantic—members of the department rejected it. </p><p>Yet, despite the overall downturn in university history programs, we know from course enrollments that students are interested in war, as indeed they are in international relations, when they get the chance to study them: At Yale, Paul Kennedy’s “Military History of the West” attracted large crowds; at Toronto’s Ryerson University, international relations courses are the most popular choices among students.</p><p>I would not suggest that student preference should determine what departments offer. But they should at least be listened to. Much more important is what we, as societies, want our future leaders to know. Political history, diplomatic history and the study of war—they all offer critical warnings and instructive analogies to our times. Social and cultural histories, and history from the bottom up, add to our understanding too. But we need balance, and a sense of how the micro- and macro-histories mesh with each other. </p><p>Do we really want citizens who have so little knowledge of how war helped to shape our values and societies and our world? Do we ever want another president asking, as Donald Trump <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pearl-harbor-memorial-tour-john-kelly-stable-genius-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T">did</a> during a visit to the Pearl Harbor memorial: “What’s this all about? What’s this a tour of?” </p><p>If we aren’t aware of how wars happen, we may fail to recognize warning signs when the next conflict brews, as it will. </p><p><strong>Margaret MacMillan is a professor of history at the University of Toronto and emeritus professor at the University of Oxford. Her latest book, </strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609692/war-how-conflict-shaped-us-by-margaret-macmillan/">War: How Conflict Shaped Us</a></strong></em><strong>, was among the </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong> 10 Best Books of 2020. </strong></p></div></div>]]>

<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Trump_is_a_product_of_bad_schooling">Trump is a product of bad schooling</span></h3>
<p>Donald Trump is the most erratic president in the US history.
</p><p>If I told you I blame the education system for the emergence of Trump, you would probably first think about the president's own spotty world knowledge. His presidential credentials are not too strong in that department. However, his education is still well above the average. If I added that my claim is not about Trump but about society, your second bet might be placed on the dismal level of education provided by American schools. I would reply that it does not take a genius to differentiate between qualities of Trump, Hillary, Bush or Obama.
</p><p>Education systems around the world are under the assault of critics of all sorts. We keep complaining and the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform" title="Reform">change is coming</a>. However, there is still a last bastion of schooling that seems pretty resistant: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Socialization" title="Socialization">socialization</a>. There is an overwhelming belief that kids get their socialization at school. Even the best homeschoolers or unschoolers have to repeatedly answer the question: "<i>What about socialization?</i>". In this text, I show that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Social_groups_in_socialization#Socialization:_Open_and_closed_systems" title="Social groups in socialization">open system socialization</a> would never let Trump emerge as the leader of the world. A tempered version of Trump might still be successful in real estate. He would be more ethical, less bombastic, more knowledgeable, less angry, more tame, etc. In open socialization, Trump would be better, Trump would be less prominent, and Trump would not care about his prominence.
</p><p>We socialize children for readiness in the idealized society. As a result, they are not ready to face dangers of reality. If Donald Trump sparked a nuclear war, I would blame the polished socialization based on polished rules in closed systems such as schools or daycare centers. 
</p>
<p>Instead of preparing children for an idealized society, we should let them adopt freely to real social environments</p>
<h3><span id="Why_should_I_speak_about_Trump.3F">Why should I speak about Trump?</span></h3>
<p>Using Trump's rich twitter feed, many a psychiatrist cannot patiently watch the show without a burning itch to violate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwater_rule">Goldwater rule</a>. It is tempting to produce a distance diagnosis from the comfort of one's own keyboard.
</p><p>I am also mystified by Trump's brain and behavior. However, my diagnosis is pretty different from the consensus that seems to emerge in the media. My viewpoint is unique for two reasons. On one hand, my work on memory, learning, creativity, and intelligence provide a unique interpretation for Trump's thinking and his behavior. My knowledge exculpates the president on many counts. On the other hand, my own behavior and personality show some parallels that help me empathetically get into Trump's head. I need to hurry to add that I respect women, honor the truth, value the rich constellation of cultures, and worship science. However, my similarities with Trump go deep into how my brain works, and why it sets us both well apart from the social norm.
</p><p>In the end, I believe my conclusions are pretty important. If I am right, we will know how to handle Trump, and how to prevent future Trumps from becoming troublemakers.
</p>
<h3><span id="Diagnosis_by_media">Diagnosis by media</span></h3>
<p>Hundreds of armchair critics, haters, and homegrown scientists have hypothesized on the reasons for Donald Trump's weirdness. Serious scientists also took on the job of "remote diagnosis" with most of the conclusions drawn from news reports on Trump's behavior and decisions. I respect the Goldwater rule when it comes to serious diagnosis. Barry Goldwater was also "remotely" diagnosed as "unfit to be president". Psychiatrists tried to avoid making wild generalizations ever since. However, there should be no gag order on a free discussion. This is why I do not mind "virtual science at a distance". I like hypotheses and models, even if <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/What%27s_the_value_of_wrong_models%3F" title="What's the value of wrong models?">they are wrong</a>. Luckily, I am no psychiatrist, and I need not worry about my license and reputation.
</p><p>In wild hypothesizing, Trump is a particularly interesting case because he makes news daily, and so do critics who bring forward a whole array of mental diseases and cognitive impairments. My interest in Trump's brain comes from the fact that my job provides an entirely different perspective, and to the chagrin of all antagonists, I must say that I see no signs of serious pathology. Just the opposite, Trump's brain is pretty good a specimen that many should envy. A good brain does not prevent committing abhorrent acts such as "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44518942">putting kids in cages</a>" (compare: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Would_you_have_a_heart_to_cage_a_puppy%3F" title="Would you have a heart to cage a puppy?">Putting puppies in cages</a>). The trick to a well-organized society is to find ways to employ good brains for a good cause. I see a couple of reasons why this is not the case for Trump.
</p>
<h3><span id="When_Goldwater_rule_does_not_apply">When Goldwater rule does not apply</span></h3>
<p>Sharon Begley argues the pros and cons of the Goldwater rule in her article "<a href="http://www.statnews.com/2017/12/06/goldwater-rule-psychiatry/">Experts challenge the science behind ban on psychiatrists discussing politicians’ mental health</a>".
</p><p>If psychiatry is an art, we can often arrive at major differences of opinion. Apparently, personality disorders are particularly affected. Most of all, if Trump's prime diagnosis is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder">narcisissm</a>, he is a particularly grateful subject for analysis. Here is an excerpt from Begley's argument (shortened):
</p>
<blockquote><div><p>The flaws of psychiatric exams and the usefulness of other data make the Goldwater rule "scientifically indefensible," said Dr. Leonard Glass, a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School. "I sort of believed" that interviews offer the clearest window into someone’s mind, he said.</p><p>"Psychiatrists are taught that if a patient says he has three drinks a day, double that," said Dr Glass. "The psychiatric interview is flawed." His and other psychiatrists’ clinical experience is backed up by studies going back to the <a href="http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/research/biometrics/Publications/Biometrics%20Archives%20PDF/614Spitzer&amp;Fleiss1974.pdf">1970s</a> in which patients were examined by two psychiatrists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990547/">back-to-back</a>. The rate of agreement was so low that "the unreliability of psychiatric diagnosis has been and still is a major problem in psychiatry," researchers concluded. Later studies reported similar discrepancies, especially for <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cpsp.12088/abstract">personality disorders</a>, finding that examination-based conclusions by a psychiatrist often <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-39264-001">disagree with</a> assessments in a structured research setting.</p><p>Markers of pathological narcissism — grandiose self-importance, entitlement, exploitativeness, and lack of empathy — can be seen in someone’s public behavior, especially in the case of a public figure whose behavior and speech has been documented in hundreds of hours of TV interviews, speeches, offhand remarks, and tweets, plus the accounts of people who have lived or worked closely with him. This evidence can also be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17629778">more accurate</a> than information from formal examinations.</p></div></blockquote>
<h3><span id="Is_virtual_psychiatric_diagnosis_valid.3F">Is virtual psychiatric diagnosis valid?</span></h3>
<p>I refuse to give up modelling, or speaking about brains, esp. in a situation where important conclusions can be drawn and inspire others. This is also my chance to transmit an important message about the school system. I claim that Trump is a child of modern schooling. In part, schooling might have damaged Trump. But more importantly, schooling damaged the electorate that Trump can now easily play with his social tricks.
</p><p>Secondly, we can't escape semi-professional psychiatric diagnosis and/or hypothesizing. Hillary 2016 was also a subject of wild hypotheses. At some point a strong meme started circulating the net: she suffered a serious brain trauma in a fall. Allegedly, she was no longer fit to be president.
</p><p>I was a subject of a pop diagnosis too. My own odd behavior was at times explained by my colleagues as a result of growing up without a father. I disagree: I had a dad and two moms (with my older siblings playing the roles). I was also a subject of a wild hypothesis that my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Can_incremental_reading_cause_brain_damage%3F" title="Can incremental reading cause brain damage?">brain may have been injured</a> by decades of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>. That diagnosis makes me grin and giggle. The childish side of my personality makes me enjoy that kind of anxious theory. Most importantly, such a misdiagnosis is a fantastic ground for inspiration and further analysis.
</p><p>I see nothing wrong with hypothesizing, esp. when it is done in a casual blog with all caveats listed. I stand for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/On_freedom_of_education_and_freedom_of_information" title="On freedom of education and freedom of information">free speech</a>, and I love inspiration.
</p><p>Some of my words in this text might be a bit offensive to president Trump, and I hate to offend. However, so many bad things have been said about the president, that my text may actually be taken as preponderantly complimentary.
</p>
<h3><span id="Trump.27s_brain_is_good">Trump's brain is good</span></h3>
<p>Opponents may hate to admit it, but Trump's brain is strong and his success is attributable to his brain properties.
</p><p>Most of the criticism of Trump's brain comes from the fact that we have set up a set of standards that we believe world leaders should live up to. They range from moral standards to <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tech/2017/8/30/16224184/president-trump-twitter-spelling">spelling</a>. In psychiatry, we should always divide abnormal behavior into two categories: (1) <b>deviant</b> and (2) <b>maladaptive</b>. In addition, we need to separate (1) cognitive <b>tradeoff</b> from (2) cognitive <b>pathology</b>.
</p><p>Trump meets all the criteria of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder">narcissistic personality disorder</a> except for one key factor: his narcissism does not lead to a significant impairment in functioning (in the light of his own goals). Just the opposite. Trump can use his bombast to his advantage. It might be a classic compensation via training. All healthy brains are capable of an excellent adaptation to the environment. Trump's brain has adapted to compensate for a great deal of bullets taken straight from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5">DSM-5</a>.
</p><p>Trump is highly deviant, but his adaptation is excellent. He won the presidency. If an individual with a set of maladaptive traits could achieve that, we should fear for the future of democracy. Trump is also high on cognitive tradeoffs: he is strong at spotting patterns, and this characteristic always comes with a high disregard for detail. This is a typical cognitive tradeoff.
</p><p>In summary, Trump's brain is strong. A strong brain does not prevent one from being a freak.

    <p>While developing the firmware for Winterbloom's <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux">Castor &amp; Pollux</a>, I got very curious as to just what the Microchip/Atmel-provided linker script was doing.</p>
<p>If you've never heard of or seen a linker script before you're not alone. Most of us never even have to think about them, however, on memory constained embedded devices it's not uncommon to need to modify the default linker script.</p>
<p>The linker script controls how <code>ld</code> combines all of your <code>.o</code> files into a single <code>.elf</code> and how that resulting <code>.elf</code> file gets loaded by the target processor.</p>
<p>So I was staring at this script that made absolutely no sense to me. It's filled with incantations and mysterious symbols and there's no indication of what they're for or where they come from.</p>
<p>So I did a <strong>lot</strong> of research and now I can present to you <strong>the most thoroughly commented linker script</strong><sup id="fnref:probably"><a href="#fn:probably">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can see this script in its entirety, comments and all, on <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux/blob/master/firmware/scripts/samd21g18a.ld">GitHub</a>. But if you'd like to read it here instead it's transcribed below.</p>
<h2 id="output-format">Output format</h2>
<p>Output format sets the ELF output format to use a specific BFD backend.</p>
<p>The first is the default BFD. The second and third arguments are used
when big (-EB) or little (-EL) endian is requested.</p>
<p>Since the SAM D series are configured with only little endian support,
"elf32-littlearm" is used across the board. This option seems to be
included by Atmel/Microchip out of an abundance of caution, as
arm-none-eabi-ld will do the right thing and use "elf32-littlearm" by
default.</p>
<p>The list of acceptable values can be obtained using <code>objdump -i</code>.</p>

<p>These variables are used by the following "MEMORY" command to define
the various memory spaces.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21G18A used by this project, the available Flash is
262kB and the available SRAM is 32kB.</p>
<p>This project also reserves 8kB for the bootloader and 1kB for
"non-volatile memory" (NVM) - which is used by the application
to store calibration and user settings.</p>

<p>ARM Cortex-M processors use a descending stack and generally
require stack space to be set aside in RAM.</p>
<p>The application's behavior determines just how much stack space
should be reserved. I generally start with 2kB (0x800) of
stack space for Cortex-M0+ projects programmed in C .</p>
<p>You can analyze stack usage in GCC using the <code>-fstack-usage</code>
flag and you can enable compiler warnings for stack usage
with <code>-Wstack-usage=STACK_SIZE</code>.</p>

<p>This section declare blocks of memories for specific purposes. Since an
ARM's address space is generally split between Flash, SRAM, peripherals,
and other regions, it's necessary to tell the linker where different
types of data can go in the address space.</p>
<p>These blocks will be used in the <code>SECTIONS</code> command below.</p>

<p>Start with the Flash memory region. On the SAMD21, Flash starts at
the beginning of the address space (<code>0x00000000</code>) and is contiguous
right up to the size of the Flash. Flash is marked a <code>rx</code> so
that the linker knows that this space is read-only (<code>r</code>) and
executable (<code>x</code>).</p>
<p>The "bootloader" section allows this firmware to work with the uf2
bootloader. The bootloader takes the first 0x2000 bytes of flash
memory.</p>

</pre>
<p>Following the bootloader is the flash memory used by the application,
called "rom" here - even though it's flash, the name is just a name
and doesn't carry special meaning.</p>
<p>The total length of the rom block is the MCU's flash size minus the
bootloader's size and any space reserved for "non-volatile memory"
by the application.</p>

</pre>
<p>The "nvm" block is space set aside for the application to store
user settings and calibration data in the MCU's flash.</p>
<p>The block is located right at the end of the flash space. This
is useful because it means that it says in a fixed location
regardless of how much flash space the application takes up
in "rom". Explicitly defining this section also lets the
linker ensure that application code doesn't overwrite the
data in this region.</p>
<p>This block is marked as read-only (<code>r</code>) because flash can not
be written in the same way as normal memory, however, the
application can use the SAMD's NVM peripheral to write data in
this region.</p>

<p>The "ram" block is mapped to the CPU's SRAM and it's where

<h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
<p>The sections command tells the linker how to combine the
input files into an output ELF and where segments belong
in memory.</p>
<p>The linker takes a set of input files containing the "input
sections" and uses this to map them to "output sections"
which are placed in the output ELF file.</p>
<p>While the most important sections to think about here
are the ones that'll be placed into the memory (segments)
some sections are just placed in the output ELF for debugging.</p>

<p>The vector table defines the initial stack pointer and
interrupt/exception routines for the ARM CPU and device
peripherals. Every Cortex-M project needs this.</p>
<p>For the SAM D series the vector table is expected
to be at address 0x00000000 after reset. Since
flash memory starts at 0x00000000, the first values
in flash should be the vector table.</p>
<p>When defining the vector table in code you must use
<code>__attribute__ ((section(".vectors")))</code> to tell
GCC to place the vector table into the section
named ".vectors" in the input object file so that
the linker can find it.</p>
<p>Note that since this project uses the UF2 bootloader,
this actually gets placed at the beginning of the
program's flash area (0x2000). The Cortex-M allows
changing the vector table after initialization,
so the startup script sets the Vector Table Offset
Register (<code>SCB-&gt;VTOR</code>) to <code>_sfixed</code> during its
intialization. The <code>_efixed</code> symbol is unused but
included for completeness.</p>

<p>Include code and read-only data sections from all
input files.</p>
<p>By default, GCC places all program code into a section named
".text" and read-only data (such as const static variables) into
a section named ".rodata" in the input object files. This naming
convention is from the ELF ABI specification.</p>
<p>GCC generates three "flavors" of sections in object files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.{section}</code>: the basic section.</li>
<li><code>.{section}.*</code>: sections generated by <code>-ffunction-sections</code> and
<code>-fdata-sections</code> so that each function/data has a unique
section.</li>
<li><code>.gnu.linkonce.{type}.*</code>: sections generated by GCC so the
linker can remove duplicates. Seems to be related to
Vague Linking.</li>

          <center><h2>Open Source Archetypes:<br>A Framework For Purposeful Open Source</h2></center>

          <p>“Open source” means many things to many people.  Many kinds
          of projects get grouped under the label "open source", and
          they may operate in very different ways.  Sometimes it helps to think
          through how an effort’s open source approach matches its
          goals, resources, and environment.  Our
          <a href="https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf">field guide to Open Source Archetypes</a> is designed to help
          with that thinking, by providing a common vocabulary to
          discuss open source in ways that take account of important
          differences.</p>

          <p>The guide describes and compares a number of project
          archetypes we have observed.  We prepared it in partnership
          with <a href="https://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, and our
          organizations (as well
          as <a href="https://blog.jwf.io/2020/11/open-source-archetypes-unicef-open-source/">others</a>) have found it useful in deciding how to invest
          in open source endeavors.</p>

			<p><span>O</span>n Jan. 1, 2021, five long years after the vote for what’s become known as Brexit, and numerous marches before and after that national decision, some of which attracted more than 100,000 impassioned participants, Great Britain formally severed its nearly half century-long ties with the European Union. The decision, as columnist Owen Jones described it in <i>The Guardian</i>, was to foment “an all-out culture war.”</p><p>In the 2016 vote, the majority of British people stubbornly chose for their country to be on its own and not part of a more encompassing group of societies. The vote appeared to run against the broader trend of European nations loosening their boundaries in acknowledgement of an identity that outweighs, or erases, the impor­tance of the societies themselves. With the number of societies in gener­al declining century after century,<sup>1</sup> we might take seriously the assertion that the internationalization of culture (think <i>Star Wars</i>, tequila, Mercedes-Benz) and connections (with Twitter linking people from Aa, Estonia, to Zu, Afghanistan) are a harbinger of a Berlin Wall-type border collapse, making, as the British sociologist Morris Ginsberg once put it, “The unification of mankind [is] one of the clearest trends in human history.”<sup>2</sup></p><blockquote><p>The European Union offers no grand foundation story, no venerable symbols or traditions.</p> </blockquote><p>Whatever the ultimate relationship of Great Britain and Europe may be, the current breakup underscores how deeply national identity runs through human psychology. A review of both the psychology literature and anthropological research on societies ranging from the ethnolinguistic groups of hunter-gatherers to tribes, chiefdoms, and states (less formally, “nations”),<sup>3</sup> reveal that a universal society is unattainable. Populations across the globe today may devour Starbucks, KFC, and Coca-Cola. They may enjoy Italian opera, French couture, and Persian carpets. But no matter how many exotic influences each absorbs or what foreign connections they make, nations don’t just fade away. They retain their citizens’ fierce devotion.<sup>4</sup> Societies have always traded, gifted, or taken what they want from the outer world to claim as their own, and grown all the stronger for doing so. While the erasure of borders may be laudable, nothing we know about the workings of the human mind suggests it is a realistic vision.<br></p><p><span>T</span>hroughout history, humankind has successfully er­ected umbrella organizations composed of multiple societies. That such groups fail to supersede bonds to the societies themselves is demonstrated by the most binding association of societies in the anthropological record. In northwest Amazonia reside 20 or so tribes, or language groups, known collectively as the Tukanoans. Each has its own language or dialect, some similar, some mutually unintelligible. The tribes are tied economically, each a specialist on goods it exchanges with the others. Cross-connecting them are what amount to obligatory trade relations of a novel sort: Marriage within a tribe is improper. “Those who speak the same language with us are our brothers, and we do not marry our sisters,” the people say.<sup>5</sup> Thus a bride marries into another tribe, where she learns the local tongue.</p><p>One explanation for this arrangement is that it reduces inbreeding in small societies, an incestuous act to which <i>Homo sapiens</i> has an innate abhorrence. We see this in many nonhumans as well, such as in chimpanzees, where females avoid mating with kin by likewise transferring between communities. The psychological aversion to marrying a sibling presents a far greater problem for the Tukanoans, whose numbers have been miniscule at times in the past, than for the massive countries of today. Perhaps this fear overpowered any trepidation those people have about firmly bonding their societies. The compulsory spousal exchanges have created some of the tightest alliances ever recorded, currently totaling about 30,000 Amazonian souls. Yet for all that, Tukanoan tribes remain clear and separate, each confined to specific areas.<sup>6</sup></p><blockquote><p>If a mass hypnotist caused us to forget our differences, we would scramble to invent new ones.</p> </blockquote><p>A failure of alliances to supersede people’s affiliation to their society holds true universally. Intergovernmental organizations like the European Union and the United Nations don’t earn our primary emotional commitment because they lack ingredients that make them real for the members. The EU may be the most ambitious attempt at societal integration conceived, yet few members see the EU as an entity worthy of their loyalty the way they do their countries, and for several reasons.<br></p><p>First off, the EU’s borders are indefinite—indeed, are subject to revision as states enter or go. Additionally, its members have a history of conflict dating from the Middle Ages, and a split already exists from east to west among communist and capitalist cultures. To top all that off, the EU offers no grand foundation story, no venerable symbols or traditions, and there’s little sense anyone would fight and die for Europe as they might for their nation.<sup>7</sup> That makes the EU a political coalition much like the Iroquois Confederacy once was for six American Indian tribes, or the league of states formed within what is now China during the sixth century B.C.<sup>8</sup><br></p><p>The strength of such associations wax or wane given their value at the moment. As with our personal relationships, friends can become enemies who turn into friends again, something that’s been shown for the ever-shifting relationships among many American Indian tribes.<sup>9</sup> Each country in the EU handles passports and other issues relating to its citizens’ identity and remains the focus of their self-worth, an outlook that makes its membership secondary and disposable. Analysis of the 2016 Brexit vote shows that those who most strongly think of themselves as English went against staying with the EU. Voters saw what was intended foremost to be an economic and peacekeeping tool as a threat to their identity.<sup>10</sup> The fact is the consequences of Brexit will be mostly commercial, setting into action a myriad of obstacles to trade.<sup>11</sup></p><div>

</div><p>Ironically, Britain’s relations with the EU unraveled when its self-iden­tity was under stress, with Northern Ireland and Scotland increasingly like­ly opting to secede from the UK, a fracture along ancient cultural lines that’s the norm for modern societies.<sup>12</sup> Meanwhile, the loss of Britain has invigorated the ties of the mem­ber nations to the EU, along the lines of what one sees when a group of people pull together in the face of adversity—but that doesn’t mean the divisions within the EU will disappear.<sup>13</sup></p><p>Financial and security issues hold the EU together. The same can be said for Swit­zerland, a country subject to perennial scrutiny because, as the four languages and complex territoriality of its people attest, its nationhood rests on a detailed social and political alliance between 26 local communities, or cantons. These self-governing settlements act in many respects as miniature nations nestled in a mountain landscape that enhances each one’s physical separation and autonomy.<sup>14</sup> “Each Canton has its own history, constitution and flag, and some even have an anthem,” political scientist Antoine Chollet reports, such that Swiss “citizenship refers to one who can vote and nothing more.”<sup>15</sup> Formation of the Swiss confederation required rewriting accounts of the past to maintain a sense of equality between the cantons, allowing them to survive over the centuries when they were forc­ed to negotiate their interests with far larger and more powerful neighboring countries.<sup>16</sup></p><p>The EU and Switzerland are regional entities kept intact by perceived needs to counter hazards from outsiders, a motivating factor that gives both a reasonable chance of success. An absolutely global union would have no such motivation, making it far more precarious. One possible means of attaining that unity might be to shift people’s perception of who’s an outsider. It was a point Ronald Reagan liked to make. “I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world,” he remarked in an address to the UN. Indeed, science-fiction tales like <i>The War of the Worlds</i> depict humankind acting as one against a common enemy.</p><p>Yet even then our societies would endure the space aliens. The arrival of Martians wouldn’t make nations irrelevant any more than Europeans arriving in Australia caused the Aborigines to drop what had been several hundred clear-cut tribal groups (actually, many Aborigines first guessed that the Europeans were otherworldly, i.e., ghosts<sup>17</sup>). That would be so regardless of how much the aliens shattered the beliefs people held about their own societies, whose beloved differences would look trivial by comparison to those with the Little Green Men. Cosmopolitanism, the conviction that the diverse people of our planet will come to feel a primary connection to the human race (the term means “citizen of the cosmos”),<sup>18</sup> is a pipe dream.</p><p><span>B</span>ut what might happen if people could forgo those traits that “mark” their identities or somehow put aside the drive to categorize each other by means of such labels—to separate us from them based on language, clothing, gestures, or religious beliefs? In such a world the only reliable differences we would perceive would be between individuals—not between groups. One supposes that under such circumstances our nations would disintegrate entirely, but it’s hard to predict what would rise in their stead. Maybe our af­filiations would coalesce around local neighborhoods or around those who we know best, with the global population splintering into millions of micro-nations. We might foresee a return to the societies of our prehuman forebears, when, like chimpanzees and most other vertebrates, every individual literally had to remember everybody else in their society.</p><p>Or, by discarding our differences, or our penchant for making judgments …</p></div></div>

<h2>Reverse Engineering The Great Escape</h2>

<p><dfn>The Great Escape</dfn> is a classic 1986 prison break game for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">48K ZX Spectrum</a>. I've spent a considerable amount of time reverse engineering its routines and documenting its workings while simultaneously reimplementing it as portable C code. The following pages describe the process I went through.</p>

<p>This is an expanded-upon write-up of some of what I can dimly recall saying while presenting <a href="http://slides.com/dpt/the-great-escape/#/">these slides</a> to my team at INSIDE Secure (formerly Metaforic, now called <a href="https://www.verimatrix.com/">Verimatrix</a>) in Glasgow at a talk in January 2016.</p>

        <p>Other developers faced this issue. As far as I know, they solved it by replying to that message and telling them about the engine and the transition to Solar2D. I remember <a href="https://forums.solar2d.com/u/grahamranson1">@GrahamRanson1</a> solving this. Maybe he could help.</p>

<p>My game is using Corona Game Engine. It is 10 years in business of delivering games to Apple App Store. It is unrelated to COVID-19 or coronaviruses. It is also registered trademark of the Corona Labs.</p>
<p>Corona is a common word, which has meanings outside of the pandemic. Like <span>#3</span> game engine by games on mobile devices.</p>

          <p>In case anybody still has problems with App Store rejection due to Corona references in the meta data, I just ran into that problem when submitting an update for Ice Trap that was rejected because:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Your app contains Corona references in the info_plist and other files in your binary, to what purpose does your app reference said subjects?</li>
<li>What are the steps needed to locate those references within your binary?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I replied the following and Apple was ok with it, and the update is now ready for sale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason for “Corona references” in the plist file is because the game itself is built using the Corona 2D game engine which has existed for probably at least 10 years. See <a href="https://coronalabs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://coronalabs.com</a>.</p>
<p>Since the Corona pandemic started, a rebranding of the Corona game engine has taken place and it is now known as Solar2D, see <a href="https://solar2d.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://solar2d.com/</a>.</p>
<p>However, a lot of the internal libraries and plugins used by the engine still contain the Corona name and/or the <a href="http://coronalabs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">coronalabs.com</a> domain name. This is nothing that is ever exposed to the end users and there are definitely no connections or references to the Covid-19 virus, just a very unfortunate name collision.</p>
<p>Hope you have understanding, as there is nothing I can do to change that.</p>
