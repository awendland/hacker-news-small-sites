					<h3>Introduction / Warning</h3>
<p>Any traditional introductory statistics course will teach students the definitions of modes, medians and means. But, because introductory courses can’t assume that students have much mathematical maturity, the close relationship between these three summary statistics can’t be made clear. This post tries to remedy that situation by making it clear that all three concepts arise as specific parameterizations of a more general problem.</p>
<p>To do so, I’ll need to introduce one non-standard definition that may trouble some readers. In order to simplify my exposition, let’s all agree to assume that \(0^0 = 0\). In particular, we’ll want to assume that \(|0|^0 = 0\), even though \(|\epsilon|^0 = 1\) for all \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). This definition is non-standard, but it greatly simplifies what follows and emphasizes the conceptual unity of modes, medians and means.</p>
<h3>Constructing a Summary Statistic</h3>
<p>To see how modes, medians and means arise, let’s assume that we have a list of numbers, \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), that we want to summarize. We want our summary to be a single number, which we’ll call \(s\). How should we select \(s\) so that it summarizes the numbers,  \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), effectively?</p>
<p>To answer that, we’ll assume that \(s\) is an effective summary of the entire list if the typical discrepancy between \(s\) and each of the \(x_i\) is small. With that assumption in place, we only need to do two things: (1) define the notion of discrepancy between two numbers, \(x_i\) and \(s\);  and (2) define the notion of a typical discrepancy. Because each number \(x_i\) produces its own discrepancy, we’ll need to introduce a method for aggregating the individual discrepancies to order to say something about the typical discrepancy.</p>
<h3>Defining a Discrepancy</h3>
<p>We could define the discrepancy between a number \(x_i\) and another number \(s\) in many ways. For now, we’ll consider only three possibilities. All of these three options satisfies a basic intuition we have about the notion of discrepancy: we expect that the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) should be \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| = 0\) and that the discrepancy should be greater than \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| &gt; 0\). That leaves us with one obvious question: how much greater should the discrepancy be when \(|x_i – s| &gt; 0\)?</p>
<p>To answer that question, let’s consider three definitions of the discrepancy, \(d_i\):</p>
<ol>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\)</li>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\)</li>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\)</li>
</ol>
<p>How should we think about these three possible definitions?</p>
<p>The first definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\), says that the discrepancy is \(1\) if \(x_i \neq s\) and is \(0\) only when \(x_i = s\). This notion of discrepancy is typically called <b>zero-one loss</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that anything other than exact equality produces a constant measure of discrepancy. Summarizing \(x_i = 2\) with \(s = 0\) is no better nor worse than using \(s = 1\). In other words, the discrepancy does not increase at all as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). You can see this reflected in the far-left column of the image below:</p>
<center><br>
<img src="http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/discrepancy1.png" alt="Discrepancy" title="discrepancy.png" width="800" height="466"><br>
</center>
<p>The second definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\), says that the discrepancy is equal to the distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called an <b>absolute deviation</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). This is reflected in the center column of the image above.</p>
<p>The third definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\), says that the discrepancy is the squared distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called a <b>squared error</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase super-linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). For example, if \(x_i = 1\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(1\). But if \(x_i = 2\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(4\). This is reflected in the far right column of the image above.</p>
<p>When we consider a list with a single element, \((x_1)\), these definitions all suggest that we should choose the same number: namely, \(s = x_1\).</p>
<h3>Aggregating Discrepancies</h3>
<p>Although these definitions do not differ for a list with a single element, they suggest using very different summaries of a list with more than one number in it. To see why, let’s first assume that we’ll aggregate the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) for each of the \(x_i\) into a single summary of the quality of a proposed value of \(s\). To perform this aggregation, we’ll sum up the discrepancies over each of the \(x_i\) and call the result \(E\).</p>
<p>In that case, our three definitions give three interestingly different possible definitions of the typical discrepancy, which we’ll call \(E\) for error:<br>
$$<br>
E_0 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.<br>
$$</p>
<p>$$<br>
E_1 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.<br>
$$</p>
<p>$$<br>
E_2 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2.<br>
$$</p>
<p>When we write down these expressions in isolation, they don’t look very different. But if we select \(s\) to minimize each of these three types of errors, we get very different numbers. And, surprisingly, each of these three numbers will be very familiar to us.</p>
<h3>Minimizing Aggregate Discrepancies</h3>
<p>For example, suppose that we try to find \(s_0\) that minimizes the zero-one loss definition of the error of a single number summary. In that case, we require that,<br>
$$<br>
s_0 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.<br>
$$<br>
What value should \(s_0\) take on? If you give this some extended thought, you’ll discover two things: (1) there is not necessarily a single best value of \(s_0\), but potentially many different values; and (2) each of these best values is one of the <b>modes</b> of the \(x_i\).</p>
<p>In other words, the best single number summary of a set of numbers, when you use exact equality as your metric of error, is one of the modes of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>What happens if we consider some of the other definitions? Let’s start by considering \(s_1\):<br>
$$<br>
s_1 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.<br>
$$<br>
Unlike \(s_0\), \(s_1\) is a unique number: it is the <b>median</b> of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use absolute differences as your metric of error, is the median of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>Since we’ve just found that the mode and the median appear naturally, we might wonder if other familiar basic statistics will appear. Luckily, they will. If we look for,<br>
$$<br>
s_2 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2,<br>
$$<br>
we’ll find that, like \(s_1\), \(s_2\) is again a unique number. Moreover, \(s_2\) is the <b>mean</b> of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use squared differences as your metric of error, is the mean of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>To sum up, we’ve just seen that the three most famous single number summaries of a data set are very closely related: they all minimize the average discrepancy between \(s\) and the numbers being summarized. They only differ in the type of discrepancy being considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>The mode minimizes the number of times that one of the numbers in our summarized list is not equal to the summary that we use.</li>
<li>The median minimizes the average distance between each number and our summary.</li>
<li>The mean minimizes the average squared distance between each number and our summary.</li>
</ol>
<p>In equations,</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\text{The mode of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0\)</li>
<li>\(\text{The median of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1\)</li>
<li>\(\text{The mean of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2\)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We’ve just seen that the mode, median and mean all arise from a simple parametric process in which we try to minimize the average discrepancy between a single number \(s\) and a list of numbers, \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) that we try to summarize using \(s\). In a future blog post, I’ll describe how the ideas we’ve just introduced relate to the concept of \(L_p\) norms. Thinking about minimizing \(L_p\) norms is a generalization of taking modes, medians and means that leads to almost every important linear method in statistics — ranging from linear regression to the SVD.</p>

	<p><small>July 10, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Recently, the Go blog had <a href="https://blog.golang.org/module-compatibility">Keeping your Modules Compatible</a> which is about
doing exactly that as you add features and want to expand your
module's API. When the module's API involves interfaces, one of
the approaches they suggested is what I've called <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoInterfaceSmuggling">interface
smuggling</a> and what other people have
called <em>interface upgrades</em>. Let me quote the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you run into a case where you want to add a method to an existing
interface, you may be able to follow this strategy. Start by creating
a new interface with your new method, or identify an existing
interface with the new method. Next, identify the relevant functions
that need to support it, type check for the second interface, and add
code that uses it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a quite popular approach, one used by many packages in Go's
standard library and third party packages. However, it has a dark
side, and that is its unfortunate effects on middleware.</p>

<p>The problem for middleware is best illustrated by the most common
sort of middleware, which is things that interpose in the chain of
HTTP handlers to modify the results. Much middleware wants to look
at or act on some aspect of the HTTP reply, for example <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoPrometheusMetricLabels">to gather
metrics based on the result code</a>, which
means that it must modify and proxy the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter"><code>http.ResponseWriter</code></a> passed to child
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Handler"><code>http.Handler</code></a>s. Over
time the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>http</code> package</a> has
acquired a whole collection of smuggled interfaces on ResponseWriters,
such as <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#CloseNotifier"><code>http.CloseNotifier</code></a> (which is deprecated),
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Flusher"><code>http.Flusher</code></a>,
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Hijacker"><code>http.Hijacker</code></a>, and
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Pusher"><code>http.Pusher</code></a>. In the
future there will probably be more.</p>

<p>(In addition, the ResponseWriter may or may not support
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/#ReaderFrom"><code>io.ReaderFrom</code></a>.)</p>

<p>If you're a piece of middleware, the ResponseWriter you're passed
may support some, many, or all of these additional APIs. However,
Go provides you no good way to pass this support through your proxy
ResponseWriter that you're going to pass to children Handlers. The
Prometheus people try hard to do it anyway, and <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/master/prometheus/promhttp/delegator.go">the result is
rather messy</a>
and involves a combinatorial explosion of the possible combinations
of APIs. As the case of io.ReaderFrom shows, these additional APIs
don't even necessarily come from the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>http</code> package</a>. A smuggled
interface from anywhere may need to be supported.</p>

<p>One answer to this is that you just don't support these additional
APIs in your middleware, or you only support a few of them. The
problem with this is that the ResponseWriter and the client code
that people are trying to use your middleware with well have been
developed, tested, and normally used in an environment where these
expanded APIs are used, not cut off. As we all know, if you don't
test it it doesn't work. Your middleware may be the first code to
try to pass the next hop a ResponseWriter with a genuinely narrow
API, because such narrow APIs may mostly come from middleware. And
of course if there are any bugs in the result, people will blame
your middleware.</p>

<p>None of this is insurmountable. But beyond the problems and the
hassles, it means that expanding your API with interface smuggling
is decidedly not transparent if people use middleware with it. And
as a practical matter, some amount of the time your new API will
not be usable until middleware is expanded to cope with it (if it
ever is).</p>

<p>Another problem is that this expansion of middleware to cope with
your new API can't happen until your new API itself is pervasive.
Go currently provides no support for conditional building based on
the version of other packages or the state of their API, so middleware
can't include any use of your new API interfaces until it doesn't
have to build against versions of your package that predate them.</p>

<p>(People can work around this for HTTP middleware because they can
make files build only on specific minimum versions of Go. Your
package doesn't have this magical power; it's something available
only for new APIs in the Go standard library.)</p>

<p>Because nothing is new under the sun, this problem was noticed back
in 2014's <a href="https://avtok.com/2014/11/05/interface-upgrades.html">Interface Upgrades in Go</a>, which is
one of the earliest places to call this pattern an 'interface
upgrade'. The article notes the proxy problem and ends with a call
to use interface upgrades sparingly. This is good advice in my
opinion, but is very much at odds with the idea of routinely using
interface upgrades to expand your API.</p>

<![CDATA[Use Hugo to Update Your GitHub Profile]]>
            </title>

July 10, 2020 | https://roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-update-github-profile/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-update-github-profile/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>So recently Github secretly rolled out a new feature where you can create a file named <code>README.md</code> in a repo named <code>github.com/&lt;your github username&gt;/&lt;your github username&gt;</code>, and that markdown file would be rendered on your Github profile page. It means, you can now put basically anything you want on your Github profile!</p>
<p>I just read this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/">post from Simon Willson</a> about using this new feature + Github actions and a Python script to automatically generate and update his Github profile. That seemed neat so I thought about how I would do it.</p>
<p>My blog is already setup to publish using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> whenever I push a commit, so I figured I could just ride on that framework. You can already see this in action on <a href="https://github.com/roytang">my Github profile page</a>! Basically, I publish the <code>README.md</code> using my regular Hugo build, then my Travis script will deploy it to the appropriate repo.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Hugo, the trickiest part of this might be using a custom output format to generate the README.md. This is basically just a bunch of settings in your Hugo config file:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define a new Markdown media type under <code>mediaTypes</code> in your config file. For a TOML config file, that looks like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="toml">    [<span>mediaTypes</span>]
        [<span>mediaTypes</span>.<span>"text/markdown"</span>]
            <span>suffixes</span> = [<span>"md"</span>]</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define a “readme” output format (or whatever you want to name it) under <code>outputFormats</code> in your config file. For a TOML config file, that looks like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="toml">[<span>outputFormats</span>]
  [<span>outputFormats</span>.<span>readme</span>]
    <span>baseName</span> = <span>"README"</span>
    <span>mediaType</span> = <span>"text/markdown"</span>    </code></pre></div> The <code>baseName</code> here controls the output file name, while the extension is controlled by the suffixes in step 1. The <code>mediaType</code> you use here should match the one in step 1.
</li>
<li>
<p>Next is to specify which pages should have this custom output format. I used my home page for this, so under <code>outputs</code> in the config file I added the name of the output format (“readme”) in my case under “home”:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="toml">[<span>outputs</span>]
  <span>home</span> = [<span>"HTML"</span>, <span>"RSS"</span>, <span>"jsonfeed"</span>, <span>"hfeed"</span>, <span>"readme"</span>]</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last step, in your theme or your layouts folder, create a file named <code>index.README.md</code>. This will be the template used to generate the README file. Remember that this is a template to generate markdown. You can use all the normal Hugo template functions, but your output should be markdown. Here’s part of what I put in my template, which generates a list of my most recent blog posts:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go-html-template">Latest blog posts:
<span>{{</span> <span>$pages</span> <span>:=</span> <span>first</span> <span>5</span> <span>(</span><span>where</span> <span>site</span><span>.RegularPages</span> <span>"Type"</span> <span>"post"</span><span>)</span> <span>}}</span>    
<span>{{</span> <span>range</span> <span>$pages</span> <span>}}</span>
- [<span>{{</span> <span>.Title</span> <span>}}</span>](<span>{{</span> <span>.Permalink</span> <span>}}</span>)<span>{{</span> <span>end</span> <span>}}</span>

[View all posts](<span>{{</span> <span>.Permalink</span> <span>}}</span>blog)</code></pre></div> If you’re not yet too familiar with Hugo templates, you can maybe just use the above example directly first to see what it outputs. (You might need to replace <code>post</code> with <code>posts</code> or whatever your main post type is).
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have these setup, just run your usual hugo build and check the output folder to see if the README.md file was generated correctly. It should be in the root of the output folder, same place as the <code>index.html</code> for your home page. One problem I encountered with Hugo is that it insists on lowercasing all the output files, so the output file in my case is always <code>readme.md</code> and not <code>README.md</code>. I just solved this by renaming it during the Travis build.</p>
<p>I won’t discuss the travis deployment process anymore here; if you’ve done CI with Travis and Github integration before, it’s relatively straightforward to add a step to copy the readme file from the Hugo build output to the appropriate repository.</p>
<p>After setting this up, my Github profile page now automatically updates with my latest blog posts/notes/shared links! (I didn’t include photos to keep things simple). The update happens every time my site itself gets a new build, so that’s pretty neat. I’ve attached an image of the new Github profile page for reference!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! 👋 If you have been following my blog then you might have already read <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/reverse-engineering-android-apps-apktool/">the article</a> on reverse engineering an Android app by writing custom smali code. I am still very much a reverse engineering beginner so after that article, I got to learn about Frida. I was told that Frida is much faster and a lot easier for scenarios where I want to snoop on functions. Well, I am glad to report that all the suggestions were absolutely correct.</p>

<p>In this article, I will share some details about how I was able to use it to snoop around the Nike Run Club Android app. The final goal was to extract authentication tokens that Nike generates when you log-in. This was another project on the backburner and what better way to get a project off the back burner by learning something new?</p>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>

<p>I am an avid runner. Most of my friends and family know that. When I started this sport I got hooked to Nike Run Club. I used to diligently record each run so that I had a record for all my runs. This went on for 2 years until I found out that most of my new running friends were using Strava. I decided to move over to Strava but was pretty bummed by the lack of data export options in NRC.</p>

<p>There were <a href="https://gist.github.com/niw/858c1ecaef89858893681e46db63db66">documents online</a> about the Nike API and they allowed you to also export your data in the JSON format but I wanted something a bit more automated. Therefore, I decided to do what any other insane person would do and started my journey of reverse-engineering the Nike Run Club APK. I decided to go to the source and figure out if I could reverse engineer the login process and generate tokens in a completely automated fashion.</p>

<p>This article will teach you the basic usage of Frida and how you too can go ahead and snoop around different APKs. But before we go to that part, you need to know how I ended up deciding to reverse engineer the app and not simply do a MITM attack using <code>mitmproxy</code>.</p>

<h2 id="intercept-nrc-traffic">Intercept NRC traffic</h2>

<p>When I started the project, I decided to snoop the traffic using <code>mitmproxy</code>. You can download the NRC APK from <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/nike-inc/nike-run-club/nike-run-club-3-9-1-release/nike-run-club-3-9-1-2-android-apk-download/">APKMirror</a> to follow along. After downloading it, rename it to <code>nike.apk</code> so that the rest of the commands in this tutorial are version agnostic.</p>

<p>Next, you can use <code>adb</code> to install this APK on the emulator:</p>

<pre><code>$ adb install nike.apk
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you need to run <code>mitmproxy</code>. If you struggle with setting up an emulator or the proxy, refer to <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/reverse-engineering-android-apps-apktool/">this previous article</a> of mine where I go in slightly more detail about how to do these things. I used the following command to run mitmproxy:</p>

<pre><code>$ mitmproxy --set block_global=false --showhost
</code></pre>

<p>The last thing to do is to install <code>mitmproxy</code> system certificates on the Android emulator by following the <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-install-system-trusted-ca-android/">official docs</a> and point the emulator to your local <code>mitmproxy</code> instance.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dd41762550fb0ba98ccba6d98a82f2f31ed30e8e/22386/images/android-re/emulator.png" alt="Emulator proxy settings"></p>

<p>After this setup, I opened up NRC and started checking out the requests in mitmproxy. I was kinda surprised and pretty spooked by the number of analytics requests NRC was sending. There was no SSL pinning in place so I didn’t have to do anything special before all requests started showing up. All these 68 requests were before I even signed in:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7ace7aada69a0d6a0ed5eeaab40af9fb3292ce8c/199ba/images/android-re/mitmproxy-nike-all.png" alt="mitmproxy all requests"></p>

<p>When I tried signing in, I saw this login request:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d1612f6255723b63669f77bd985fcf4d326a1db2/3cac0/images/android-re/mitmproxy-login-request.png" alt="Login request"></p>

<p>It looks like a legit login request. But what is that <code>client_id</code>? Everything else seems reasonable and is something we can produce on our own but the <code>client_id</code> seems pretty <em>unique</em>. Where is it coming from?</p>

<p>I checked out a couple of requests before and after this particular API call and couldn’t find the <code>client_id</code> anywhere. It had to be generated within the APK itself. I tried replaying the request a couple of times in <code>mitmproxy</code> and it started failing after 2-3 successful replays. I started receiving this response:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
  &lt;TITLE&gt;Access Denied&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
  &lt;H1&gt;Access Denied&lt;/H1&gt;
    You don't have permission to access "http://unite.nike.com/login?" on this server.
  &lt;P&gt;
    Reference #18.2eaf3817.1593493058.26b69156
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There was something dynamic in the request and I just had to figure out what. This was the perfect excuse to start snooping inside the NRC app.</p>

<p>By the way, the NRC app makes heavy use of HTML in their app. The login page is actually an HTML document and is loaded from the server. You can access it at <a href="https://unite.nike.com/s3/unite/mobile.html?androidSDKVersion=3.1.0&amp;corsoverride=https://unite.nike.com&amp;uxid=com.nike.sport.running.droid.3.8&amp;locale=en_US&amp;backendEnvironment=identity&amp;view=login&amp;clientId=WLr1eIG5JSNNcBJM3npVa6L76MK8OBTt&amp;facebookAppId=84697719333&amp;wechatAppId=wxde7d0246cfaf32f7">this url</a>. More about this later.</p>

<h2 id="decompile-nrc-apk">Decompile NRC APK</h2>

<p>I assume you already downloaded the NRC APK from <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/nike-inc/nike-run-club/nike-run-club-3-9-1-release/nike-run-club-3-9-1-2-android-apk-download/">APKMirror</a> and renamed it to <code>nike.apk</code>. I uploaded the APK to <a href="http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk">this online version of jadx</a> and decompiled it. We are on the hunt for the <code>client_id</code> and the first thing I do whenever I am trying to find a string, I use grep:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -r `client_id` ./
</code></pre>

<p>Ooo it did output quite a bunch of stuff. This seems to be the most interesting string:</p>

<pre><code>./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    &lt;string name="unite_client_id"&gt;IFc97q8fSoR84EHfevnzBNivAiT6H+i8vmVZDnCAax/ZjSGxw5ejdekfXtCrzrtJrQfJnj30JeK+MsyruZi8sW6iUBfe//NGZlpQJXUbz8LuPEXnLMAlxKdLV6BrBgKHqNI94nfSHCCr0xW3HOZk/XyFdevndG52zmZR0XXym0yW5d8n/XvLGDCtVyryFLYoYwHYrDC9JZ+GfAacPKE5S437fT9Af+Z/AeZgqPplm9mCaPBoOc0Co4+h3nT8TvXMsU4Vy8pRTuWv0skMU0uwUkq7R/UN06daQ8AkAaYt7KWG0S36tSbHuR03ji7om8ebOJqOzgFyYOp/KfkHkvX5+PVk2lG7lk1hBltitrBND8njmHHIPisC6+W7Ul1an0mRiNTQVFfSJpyNUVvE1D17NQ==&lt;/string&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>grep</code> also told me where it was being decrypted:</p>

<pre><code>./sources/com/nike/plusgps/login/UniteConfigFactory.java:        UniteConfig uniteConfig = new UniteConfig(this.userAgentHeader.getUserAgent(), this.appResources.getString(C5369R.string.unite_experience_id), this.obfuscator.decrypt(this.appResources.getString(C5369R.string.unite_client_id)));
</code></pre>

<p>Based on my previous experience with encryption, this seems to be an AES encrypted string. But I need to make sure this is the actual <code>client_id</code> we saw in the request. Time to use Frida and hook into the APK and figure out what the decrypted value of this string is.</p>

<h2 id="intro-to-frida">Intro to Frida</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://frida.re/">official website</a>, Frida is a</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It allows you to inject scripts in native applications and check out what they are doing under the hood. We will be using it to keep a tab on method inputs in the NRC APK and also make custom calls to different methods. Before we move any further, let’s install Frida first.</p>

<h3 id="frida-installation">Frida installation</h3>

<p>There are two parts of Frida (that I am aware of). Frida client and Frida server. The client runs on the host operating system and the server runs of the Android/iOS device. To make testing easier, it is much better to use an Android emulator with Frida.</p>

<h3 id="installing-the-client-python-packages">Installing the client Python packages</h3>

<p>For the client-side, there are again two separate packages/libraries we can install using <code>pip</code>. One is called <code>frida</code> and the other is called <code>frida-tools</code>. <code>frida</code> allows us to import and use <code>frida</code> in our code while <code>frida-tools</code> provide us with some really useful command-line tools that will help us in the whole reverse engineering process.</p>

<p>Let’s create a new directory and a virtual environment and install both of these packages. We will work on the server part after this.</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir nike_project
$ cd nike_project
$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install frida frida-tools
</code></pre>

<p>If everything has been installed and set up correctly, <code>frida-ps -h</code> should output something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ frida-ps -h
Usage: frida-ps [options]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -D ID, --device=ID    connect to device with the given ID
  -U, --usb             connect to USB device
  -R, --remote          connect to remote frida-server
  -H HOST, --host=HOST  connect to remote frida-server on HOST
  -O FILE, --options-file=FILE
                        text file containing additional command line options
  -a, --applications    list only applications
  -i, --installed       include all installed applications
  -j, --json            output results as JSON
</code></pre>

<h3 id="installing-the-frida-server-on-android">Installing the <code>frida-server</code> on Android</h3>

<p>Now we have to install the frida-server on the Android emulator (you can also use your Android device but I prefer the emulator for testing). At the time of writing this article, the latest release of the frida-server is 12.10.4. You can check the latest version at <a href="https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/">GitHub</a>. Just change the version number in the commands below and they should work:</p>

<pre><code>wget https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/12.10.4/frida-server-12.10.4-android-x86_64.xz
unxz frida-server-12.10.4-android-x86_64.xz
adb push frida-server-12.10.4-android-x86_64 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
</code></pre>

<p>The above commands downloaded and copied the frida-server to the emulator, now we need to run the server. Open up adb shell:</p>

<pre><code>adb shell
</code></pre>

<p>Now run the next command within <code>adb shell</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/data/local/tmp/frida-server &amp;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="frida-hooking">Frida hooking</h2>

<p>Once we have the <code>frida-server</code> running, we can start prepping our JavaScript code for injection.</p>

<h3 id="prepping-initial-frida-hook">Prepping initial Frida hook</h3>

<p>I checked out the NRC source, followed the breadcrumbs, and found that the decryption magic was happening in the <code>NativeObfuscator</code> file. I found out the process name of the NRC app by running <code>frida-utils -Ua</code> and then wrote the following Python code for testing my hypothesis:</p>

<pre><code>import frida, sys

jscode = """
Java.perform(function (){
    var MainActivity = Java.use('com.nike.plusgps.onboarding.login.WelcomeActivity');
    var ConfFactory = Java.use('com.nike.plusgps.login.UniteConfigFactory');
    var String = Java.use("java.lang.String");
    var obfuscator = Java.use("com.nike.clientconfig.NativeObfuscator");
    var resources = Java.use("android.content.res.Resources");
    var logger = Java.use("com.nike.logger.NopLoggerFactory");
    var strRes = …</code></pre></section></div>

<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>Scenario: You are having an issue and you don’t know how to solve it. You tell someone “Hey, can you help me? Let me tell you my problem!”. You start telling the problem, your conversation partner doesn’t say a word and you say “Yeees, this is it! That’s the solution. Thanks for helping me!”. But you had in fact just a monologue, and you found the solution for yourself.</p>
<p>What if, instead of talking to a human being, you had a constant partner whom you would explain your problems like it were a human being. This is how my teddy bear helps me:</p>
<figure id="attachment_305" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-305"><a href="http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner.jpg"><img title="TeddyBearParingPartner" src="http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner-300x207.jpg" alt="Teddy Bear Pair Programming" width="300" height="207" srcset="https://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner-300x207.jpg 300w, https://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner-1024x707.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-305">Teddy Bear Pair Programming</figcaption></figure>

<p>This technique is called teddy bear pair programming. My teddy bear helps me when <strong>debugging</strong> some application. I tell him my issues, and I find the answers by myself, he’s that awesome!</p>
<p><em> . . . [an] effective technique is to explain your code to someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed “Never mind; I see what’s wrong. Sorry to bother you.” This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners. One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk. Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the teddy bear before they could speak to a human counsellor.</em> (Kernighan, B. W. and R. Pike (1999). The Practice of Programming. Reading, Massachusetts, Addison-Wesley)</p>
<p>When I do <strong>TDD</strong> my teddy bear help me figure out which are the next steps. I talk with him continuously, explaining what I do now, and what are the design choices I make. I need to explain everything to him because he’s so smart that he helps me without saying a word.</p>
<p>When my <strong>IDE</strong> annoys me I tell my teddy bear and I feel a lot better, because he understands me. After all in the teddy bear world they have heavyweight IDE as well.</p>
<p>Your teddy bear will help you with basically anything. You just need to verbalize your problems and ideas. It just makes magic!</p>
<p>I told my colleagues at <a href="http://www.mozaicworks.com/">Mozaic Works</a> about this idea, and as a result the following Open Agile conference they ordered teddy-bears for all the attendees.</p>

<p>Another name for teddy bear paring is the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking">Rubber Duckling</a> idea. It’s just that I like teddy bears more than ducks. And teddy bear pair-programming sounds better 🙂</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. It is also a key basic unit to the quantum computer. Usually it could be visualized using a Bloch sphere.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to derive the connections between qubit and Bloch sphere.</p>

<h3 id="classical-bit">Classical Bit</h3>

<p>A classical bit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional classical system. A classical bit could only be in one state, either $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$. $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ are orthogonal basis. Usually $| 0 \rangle = [1, 0]^{\top}$ and $| 1 \rangle = [0, 1]^{\top}$.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-bit-qubit">Quantum Bit (Qubit)</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. A qubit is a superposition of two basic states, $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$.</p>



<p>A generic (normalized) qubit is of the form</p>



<p>where $c_0$ and $c_1$ are complex numbers, and $|c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 = 1$. After taking the measurement for $| \psi \rangle$, the system would be collapsed to $| 0 \rangle$ with probability $|c_0|^2$ or $| 1 \rangle$ with probability $|c_1|^2$.</p>



<p>A complex number could be described using <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Complex-Number-Representations/">exponential form</a>.</p>



<p>Where $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ are real numbers. Therefore,</p>



<p>We could rewrite $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ using a new parameter $\frac{\theta}{2}$. We would see why we used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ shortly.</p>



<p>We multiple a complex number $e^{-i\theta_0}$ to $| \psi \rangle$.</p>



<p>We define $\varphi = \theta_1 - \theta_0$, we have</p>



<p>As we have discussed early in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-System-States/">quantum system states</a>, quantum system state $| \psi \rangle$ and $c | \psi \rangle$, where $c$ is any non-zero complex number, represent the same quantum system state. Since $e^{-i\theta_0}$ is a non-zero complex number, $| \psi \rangle$ and $e^{-i\theta_0} | \psi \rangle$ represent the same quantum system state. So we have</p>



<p>This means that, with two parameters $\theta$ and $\varphi$, we could determine a qubit state.</p>



<p>The next question is what is the minimum range of $\theta$ and $\varphi$ so that all the possible qubit states, $| \psi \rangle \in \mathbb{C}^2$s, are included? After taking the measurement of the qubit, the probability of observing $| 0 \rangle$ is $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ and the probability of observing $| 1 \rangle$ is $\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$. For different $\theta$s, if $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$s are the same, the qubit states, $| \psi \rangle$s, are also the same. Apparently, $0 \leq \frac{\theta}{2} \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$, i.e., $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$. If $\theta$ is out of this range, there is always a way to convert the $\theta$ into the range of $[0, \pi]$ while keeping $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ the same. For $\varphi$, there is not too much to say, $0 \leq \varphi &lt; 2\pi$.</p>



<p>To summarize, a qubit could be described using two independent variables.</p>



<p>Where $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ and $\varphi \in [0, 2\pi)$.</p>

<h3 id="bloch-sphere">Bloch Sphere</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.</p>



<p>Given the two-variable qubit formulation we derived above, it could perfectly fit into the Bloch sphere.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-14-Qubit-Bloch-Sphere/Bloch_sphere.svg.png">
    <figcaption>Bloch Sphere</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The north and south poles of the Bloch sphere are typically chosen to correspond to the standard basis vectors $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, respectively. Any coordinate, which could be uniquely described using $\theta$ and $\varphi$, on the sphere, represents a unique qubit.</p>



<p>It is also non-trivial to see that all the qubits on the equator, where $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, have equal probability of collapsing to $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, because $p(|0\rangle) = \cos^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $p(|1\rangle) = \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$.</p>



<p>In addition, if the qubit is more closer to the north pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |0\rangle $ after taking the measurement. Similarly, if the qubit is more closer to the south pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |1\rangle $ after taking the measurement.</p>



<p>Moreover, an arbitrary pair of orthogonal qubits is mapped to antipodal (opposite) points of the Bloch sphere. This is because, any antipodal qubits have the following representations.</p>



<p>We would like to show that $\langle \psi , \psi^{\prime} \rangle = 0$ so that $| \psi \rangle $ and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$ are orthogonal.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>Last but not least, to answer why we had used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ in the qubit representation, it is because we want to make the qubit representation compatible with the Bloch sphere. If using $\frac{\theta}{2}$, $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the Bloch sphere matches $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the qubit representation.</p>

<p>As we have partially shown in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">one of my previous posts</a>, all the classical logical gates could be considered as matrices, and all the classical bit manipulations are matrix multiplications. This also applies to quantum logical gates and qubits. Actually, all the quantum logical gates are unitary matrices. We would take this fact for now and I would probably explain this in my future blog posts.</p>



<p>Matrix $U$ is unitary if and only if</p>



<p>Unitary matrix preserves inner products. If $U$ is unitary, then for any $v, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$, we have $\langle Uv, Uv^{\prime} \rangle = \langle v, v^{\prime} \rangle$.</p>



<p>This could be easily proved by using the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">inner product properties</a>.</p>



<p>This means that unitary matrix $U$ also preserves the norm of any vector $v \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$.</p>



<p>Suppose we have a qubit $| \psi \rangle$ and unitary matrix $U$. Because $| \psi | = 1$, so $| U\psi | = 1$. In addition, given the orthogonal basis $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, because $\langle |0\rangle, |1\rangle \rangle = 1$, so $ \langle U|0\rangle, U |1\rangle \rangle = 1$. This means that $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are a new pair of orthogonal basis.</p>



<p>On the Bloch sphere, applying a unitary matrix $U$ to qubit $| \psi \rangle$ is equivalent to moving the coordinate of the qubit on the Block sphere, since unitary matrix preserves the norm of vector. Apply a unitary matrix $U$ to both $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ is equivalent to rotate the north and south poles, i.e. the coordinate system, accordingly.</p>



<p>If we look into $| U \psi \rangle$ more closely.</p>



<p>Since $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are also orthogonal basis, manipulating qubit is also equivalent to manipulating the entire coordinate system. The coordinates of $| U \psi \rangle$ in the new coordinate system ($U|0\rangle$, $U|1\rangle$) is the same to the coordinates of $| \psi \rangle$ in the old coordinate system ($|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$).</p>

<p>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) has become central to software development. To ensure high-quality software releases smoke tests, regression tests, performance tests, static code analysis &amp; security scans are run in CI/CD pipeline. Despite of all these quality measures, still OutOfMemoryError, CPU spikes, unresponsiveness, degradation in response time are surfacing in production environment.</p>



<p>These sort of performance problems surfaces in production because in CI/CD pipeline only macro level metrics such as: Static code quality metrics, test/code coverage, CPU Utilization, memory consumption, response time… are studied. In several cases these macro-metrics aren’t sufficient enough to uncover performance problems. In this article let’s review the micrometrics that should be studied in CI/CD pipeline to deliver high quality releases in production. We will also learn how to source this micrometrics and integrate it into CI/CD pipeline.</p>



<h3>How Tsunamis are forecasted?</h3>



<p>You might wonder why Tsunami forecasting is related to this article. There is a relationship :-). A normal sea wave travels at a speed of 5 – 60 miles/hr, whereas Tsunami waves travel at a speed of 500 – 600 miles/hr. Even though Tsunami wave travels at a speed of 10x – 100x speed of normal waves, it’s very hard to forecast Tsunami waves. Thus, modern day technologies use micrometrics to forecast Tsunami waves.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://tier1app.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/untitled-design-3.png?w=736" alt="Untitled design (3)" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://tier1app.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/untitled-design-3.png?w=736&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fig: DART Device to detect Tsunami</p>



<p>To forecast Tsunami, <strong><span>multiple DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami) devices are installed all throughout the world. This DART contains two parts:</span></strong></p>



<p>a. Surface Buoy: Device which floats at the top of ocean water<br>
b. Seabed Monitor: Device which is stationed at the bottom of the ocean</p>



<p>Deep ocean water is about 6000 meters in depth. (20x of tallest San Francisco Sales Force tower). Whenever the sea level rises more than 1 mm then DART automatically detects it and transmits this information to satellite. This 1 mm rise in sea water is a lead indicator of Tsunami origination. I would like to request you to pause here for a second and visualize length of 1 mm in the scale of 6000 meters sea depth. It’s nothing, negligible. But this micrometric analysis is what used for forecasting Tsunamis.</p>



<h4><strong>How to forecast Performance Tsunamis through Micrometrics?</strong></h4>



<p>Similarly, there are few micrometrics that you can monitor in your CI/CD pipeline. This micrometrics are lead indicators of several performance problems that you will face in production. Raise or drop in values of these micrometrics are the great indicators for the origination of performance problems.</p>



<p>1. Garbage Collection Throughput<br>
2. Average GC pause time<br>
3. Maximum GC pause time<br>
4. Object creation rate<br>
5. Peak heap size<br>
6. Thread Count<br>
7. Thread States<br>
8. Thread Groups<br>
9. Wasted Memory<br>
10. Object Count<br>
11. Class Count</p>



<p>Let’s study each micrometrics in detail:</p>



<h3>1. GARBAGE COLLECTION THROUGHPUT</h3>



<p>Garbage Collection throughout is the amount of time your application spends in processing customer transactions vs amount of time your application spends in doing garbage collection.</p>



<p>Let’s say your application has been running for 60 minutes. In this 60 minutes, 2 minutes is spent on GC activities.<br>
It means application has spent 3.33% on GC activities (i.e. 2 / 60 * 100)<br>
It means Garbage Collection throughput is 96.67% (i.e. 100 – 3.33).</p>



<p>When there is a degradation in the GC throughput, it’s an indication of some sort of memory problem. Now the question is: What is the acceptable throughput %? It depends on the application and business demands. Typically, one should target for more than 98% throughput.</p>



<h3>2. AVERAGE GARBAGE COLLECTION PAUSE TIME</h3>



<p>When Garbage Collection event runs, entire application pauses. Because Garbage Collection has to mark every object in the application, see whether those objects are referenced by other objects, if there is no references then it will have to be evicted from memory. Then fragmented memory has to be compacted. To do all these operations, application will be paused. Thus when Garbage collection runs, customer will experience pauses/delays. Thus one should always target to attain low average GC pause time.</p>



<h3>3. MAX GARBAGE COLLECTION PAUSE TIME</h3>



<p>Some Garbage collection events might take a few milliseconds, whereas some garbage collection events might also take several seconds to minutes. You should measure maximum garbage collection pause time, to understand the worst possible impact to the customer. Proper tuning (and if needed application code changes) are needed to reduce the maximum Garbage Collection pause time.</p>



<h3>4. OBJECT CREATION RATE</h3>



<p>Object creation rate is the average amount of objects created by your application. Maybe in your previous code commit, application was creating 100mb/sec. Starting from recent code commit, application started to create 150mb/sec. This additional object creation rate can trigger lot more GC activity, CPU spikes, potential OutOfMemoryError, memory leaks when application is running for longer period.</p>



<h3>5. PEAK HEAP SIZE</h3>



<p>Peak heap size is the maximum amount of memory consumed by your application. If peak heap size goes beyond a limit you must investigate it. Maybe there is a potential memory leak in the application, newly introduced code (or 3rd libraries/frameworks) is consuming lot of memory, maybe there is legitimate use of it, if it is the case you will have change your JVM arguments to allocate more memory.</p>



<p>“Garbage collection throughput, average GC pause time, maximum GC pause time, object creation rate, peak heap size micrometrics can be sourced only from garbage collection logs. No other tools can be used for this purpose.<br> As part of your CI/CD pipeline, you need to run regression test suite or performance test (ideal). Garbage Collection logs generated from the test, should be passed to <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.gceasy.io/2016/06/18/garbage-collection-log-analysis-api/" target="_blank"><span>GCeasy’s REST API</span></a>. This API analyzes garbage collection logs and responds back with above mentioned micrometrics. To learn where this micrometrics are sent in the API response and JSON path expression for them, <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.gceasy.io/2018/07/02/key-elements-in-api-response/" target="_blank"><span> to this article</span></a>. If any value is breached, then build can be failed. GCeasy REST API has intelligence to detect various other garbage collection problems such as: memory leaks, user time &gt; sys + real time, sys time &gt; user time, invocation of System.gc() API calls,… Any detected GC problems will be reported in the ‘problem’ element of API response. You might want to track this element as well”.</p>



<h3>6. THREAD COUNT</h3>



<p>Thread count can be another key metric to monitor. If thread count goes beyond a limit it can cause CPU, memory problems. Too many threads can cause ‘java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread’ in the long-running production environment.</p>



<h3>7. THREAD STATES</h3>



<p>Application threads can be in different thread states. To learn about various thread states, refer to this <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzYLtYaJ_D0" target="_blank"><span>quick video clip</span></a>. Too many threads in RUNNABLE state can cause CPU spike. Too many threads in BLOCKED state can make application unresponsive. If number of threads in a particular thread state crosses certain threshold then you may consider generating appropriate alerts/warning in CI/CD report.</p>



<h3>8. THREAD GROUPS</h3>



<p>A thread group represents a collection of threads performing similar tasks. There could be a servlet container thread group that processes all the incoming HTTP requests. There could be a JMS thread group, which handles all the JMS sending, receiving activity. There could be some other sensitive thread groups in the application as well. You might want to track those sensitive thread groups size. You don’t want their size neither to drop below a threshold nor go beyond a threshold. Less number of threads in a thread group can stall the activities. More number of threads can lead to memory, CPU problems.</p>



<p>“Thread count, thread states, thread groups micrometrics can be sourced from thread dumps. As part of your CI/CD pipeline, you need to run regression test suite or performance test (ideal). 3 Thread dumps in a gap of 10 seconds interval should be captured when tests are running. Captured thread dumps should be passed to <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2016/10/27/thread-dump-analysis-api/" target="_blank"><span>FastThread’s REST API</span></a>. This API analyzes thread dumps and responds back with the above mentioned micrometrics.<br> To learn where this micrometrics are sent in the API response and JSON path expression for them, refer <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2018/07/02/key-elements-in-api-response/" target="_blank"><span>to this article</span></a>. If any value is breached, then build can be failed”. FastThread REST API has intelligence to detect several threading problems such as: Deadlocks, CPU spiking threads, prolonged blocking threads, … Any detected problems will be reported in the ‘problem’ element of API response. You might want to track this element as well”.</p>



<h3>9. WASTED MEMORY</h3>



<p>In modern computing world lot of memory is wasted because of poor programming practices such as: duplicate object creation, duplicate string creation, inefficient collections implementations, sub-optimal data type definitions, inefficient finalizations,.. <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.heaphero.io/2018/06/22/heap-dump-analysis-api/" target="_blank"><span>Heap Hero API</span></a> detects an amount of memory wasted due to all these inefficient programming practices. This can be a key metric to track. In case if amount wasted memory goes beyond certain percentage, then CI/CD build can be failed, or warnings can be generated.</p>



<h3>10. OBJECT COUNT</h3>



<p>You might also want to track the total number of objects that are present in the application’s memory. Object count can spike up because of inefficient code, new introduction of 3rd party libraries, frameworks. Too many objects can cause OutOfMemoryError, memory leak, CPU spike in production.</p>



<h3>11. CLASS COUNT</h3>



<p>You might also want to track the total number of classes that are present in the application’s memory. Sometimes class count can spike because of an introduction of any 3rd party libraries, frameworks. Spike in classes count, can cause problems in Metaspace/PermGen space of the memory.</p>

<p>The Lyceum Institute provides a digital environment dedicated to fostering the philosophical habit–of questioning the truth of things and the good of life–in all its members, as we collectively pursue the never-ending education of a truly mind-liberating nature. Much of education depends upon the atmosphere in which we immerse ourselves, and, in the twenty-first century, we all inhabit a digital atmosphere. The Lyceum Institute seeks a continual, communal, and thoughtful ennobling of that atmosphere.</p>







<h2>A Better Digital Life</h2>



<p>The Lyceum Institute seeks to aid its members pursuit of better habits, especially of careful thinking, and not just the preservation of truth, but its strengthening. &nbsp;This is not a program, a course, a certification process, nor simply a place to find content for passive consumption, but rather something to become a part of one’s life: a digital medium that directs one towards the development of perfective human habits, rather than deviant ones; habits of humility, generosity, insightful interpretation, willingness to hear, ardor for the truth and deepening one’s understanding, security in forming one’s beliefs, contentment, and worldly detachment.&nbsp; It is an enclave for thinking, differentiated from the world “outside” not by viewing it through a lens of gnosticism, but by instilling and maintaining a dispassionate devotion to the truth.&nbsp; It is where one may go after having observed the chaos, the disorder, the blind ideological adherence, and the sophistical machinations of the wider “intellectual” world, to learn, study, think, and most of all converse with others following a common path.&nbsp; It seeks the improvement of individual understanding through communal effort in fostering philosophical habit.</p>



<p>Digital life allows for unique educational opportunity. For one needs to do more than merely read books or blogs or articles to become educated: education always being a matter of a certain training, which entails not only reading or passive consumption of information, but the interpretative processing of that which is received and—perhaps most importantly of all—a critical conversation with others through which that interpretation may be refined and improved. No mind lives and thrives all on its own, and while reading the works of great writers is an encounter with their minds, it is one-directional only. Something more is needed—other persons, who bring not only their own minds, but all the minds they have read, all the minds they have encountered, in some way to your own.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Enrollment in the Lyceum Institute is open to all-comers: graduate and undergraduate students, professors, clergy, the philosophically-seeking general public, and so on.&nbsp; Experts and novices alike profit from the community of common purpose and the mutual support in the pursuit of bettered habits.&nbsp; It is affordable (costing less per month than most streaming entertainment services); accessible by computer, tablet, or phone, wherever one has an internet connect; and always-improving.</p>



<h2>Inquirere, Ordinare, Memorare</h2>



<p>This unique digital environment emerges from the practice of the three parts of the Institute Motto: Inquirere, Ordinare, Memorare — to inquire, to remember, and to order.</p>



<p>Why these three actions?</p>



<p>The Lyceum Institute, being a digital&nbsp;environment, is adapted to fit and fructify the habits enabled by the nature of networked digital technology–which, at its core, is archival.&nbsp; That is, the very nature of digital architecture is to receive and retain bits of information that can represent nearly anything.&nbsp; Anything done online can be archived: captured in an arrangement of data and saved for posterity; it thus extends our memorative&nbsp;habits and capacities.</p>



<p>But consequently, for this archivality to be rightly leveraged, digital technology demands a habit of categorical consideration–a habit of ordering: as any good archive must be well-ordered, and approached with an ordered mind, for it to be used properly.</p>



<p>Furthermore, this demands of us an improved capacity for questioning; that is, no quantity of archived information, no matter how well it is organized, can tell us what we need to know if we do not even know how to ask the right questions.&nbsp; Moreover, what to do with that information requires not simply “the” right question, but a habit of knowing how to formulate those questions and pursue the answers.&nbsp; See <a href="https://cpinsightcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/2020-05-lyceuminstitute_educationdigitallife.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education and Digital Life</a> for more details.</p>



<h2>Memberships</h2>



<p>Enrollment in the Lyceum Institute is sorted into three tiers: Basic, Advanced, and Premium.&nbsp; Please note that there is a $6/mo technology cost for each tier, <em>included</em> in the monthly charge.*</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>Basic Lyceum Enrollment</th><th>Advanced Lyceum Enrollment</th><th>Premium Lyceum Enrollment</th></tr><tr><td>Access to the Lyceum Institute</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Persons per account</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Philosophical Resources</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to <i>Quaestiones Disputatae</i></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Language Studies</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Lecture Recordings</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Seminar Recordings &amp; Advanced Research Archive</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>PDFs of all CPI Publications</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Seminar access</td><td></td><td>2 included</td><td>6 included</td></tr><tr><td>Additional seminar discounts</td><td>35% on one<br>

                <p><em>Last updated 2019-12-04</em></p><hr>
                
                <p>When aspiring musicians first learn to play their instruments, they rarely start composing their own songs immediately. Most start by learning to play the songs of others. This allows them to focus on skills like intonation, dynamics, and tempo. The skill of composition can wait until they have developed good playing technique.</p>

<p>By contrast, aspiring writers almost always create their own content right from the start. Have you ever heard a conversation like this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIâ€™m working on a novel.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œCool, whatâ€™s it about?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œItâ€™s Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œOh, you mean like a fanfic?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œNo, Iâ€™m telling the story of Harryâ€™s first year at Hogwarts.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œBut youâ€™re not putting a spin on it or anything?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œNope, itâ€™s the same as the story told in the original.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œWord for word?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œNo, but arc for arc. Rowlingâ€™s story, my words.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œHuh. Sort of like a cover.â€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish writing covers were considered totally normal. Iâ€™m not talking about adaptations, like Joyceâ€™s <em>Ulysses</em> (an adaptation of <em>The Odyssey</em>, set in 20th century Dublin), although I would love to see more of those too. By â€œcoversâ€�, I mean high-fidelity recreations of other peopleâ€™s written worksâ€”comprehensive paraphrases.</p>

<p>Writing is hard. When youâ€™re learning to write, you have to worry about coherence, organization, and word choice. Thatâ€™s a lot to keep track of. Writing covers is a great way to refine these skills without needing to worry about originality. If writing covers were normal, we could all practice more and improve faster.</p>

<p>There would also be better, and more niche, versions of many written works. Imagine: <em>Jane Eyre</em>, covered by J.K. Rowling. <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, covered by Richard Dawkins. <em>Twilight</em>, covered by Margaret Atwood. Covers like these do exist, but too few. A few months ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1158132219484893184">tweeted</a> about this idea, and Kevin Simler <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSimler/status/1158136084951261185">boosted</a> it to his 16,000 followers, asking for examples<sup>1</sup>. Here are some good ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hunter S. Thompson covered parts of The Great Gatsby. According to Louis Menandâ€™s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/03/07/believer">obituary of Thompson</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>, Thompson â€œused to type out pages from <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, just to get the feeling, he said, of what it was like to write that wayâ€�.</li>
  <li>Benjamin Franklin covered articles in the <em>Spectator</em>. He says in his <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page06.htm">autobiography</a>, â€œI took some of the papers, and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand.â€�</li>
  <li>Visakan Veerasamy <a href="http://www.visakanv.com/blog/politics-and-the-english-language/">covered</a> George Orwellâ€™s essay, â€œPolitics and the English Languageâ€�. He says in an introductory comment, â€œThe following is my attempt to update George Orwellâ€™s essay <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/">Politics and the English Language (1946)</a> for modern reading. Iâ€™ve tried to follow his own principles to make his words sharper and clearer where I can.â€�</li>
</ul>

<p>Look, I get it: we want to be recognized for our own ideas. And when the original source material is just a hyperlink away, why go to the trouble of paraphrasing it? One reason is that it challenges you to internalize the original authorâ€™s way of thinking. It is the deepest possible way to read a text. Another reason is that if you choose texts that are hard to paraphrase, you will stretch yourself to reproduce material that is beyond your current ability to create from scratch. This will expand the range of what you <em>can</em> create from scratch. Lastly, covers are good for readers, too: they provide new vantage points on the underlying ideas. Reading multiple versions of a text is like seeing its underlying ideas with binocular vision.</p>

<p>Covers exist in other domains too: scientists reproduce other scientistsâ€™ experiments; chefs reproduce other chefsâ€™ recipes; painters reproduce other paintersâ€™ paintings. If youâ€™re a writer, why not try your hand at reproducing another writerâ€™s work? Iâ€™ve been doing this for the past few months. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a id="deep-laziness" href="https://davidklaing.com/deep-laziness/">Deep Laziness â€” Sarah Perry</a></li>
  <li><a id="solved-conversations" href="https://davidklaing.com/solved-conversations/">Solved conversations â€” Aaron Z. Lewis</a></li>
  <li><a id="research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process" href="https://davidklaing.com/research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process/">Research as a stochastic decision process â€” Jacob Steinhardt</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s been great exercise for my writing muscles, and I now have enough â€œoriginalâ€�<sup>2</sup> ideas to last me several blog posts. Even if those ideas run dry, I donâ€™t have to worry about writerâ€™s block. If my own ideas arenâ€™t flowing, I can just cover someone elseâ€™s.</p>

<hr>

<p>1. There is another whole category of examples that exist almost by luck: translations. If it werenâ€™t for the fact that many of the greatest works of literature were composed in languages other than our own, we might not get to enjoy them as much as we do. Nobody would be iterating on the language. A few notable examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf">Beowulf</a>, translated by none other than J.R.R. Tolkien.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39800574-ursula-k-le-guin-yorumuyla-tao-te-ching">The Tao Te Ching</a>, translated by Ursula K. Le Guin, the renowned science fiction writer.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem">The Three-Body Problem</a>, translated by Ken Liu. It is <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/wired-book-club-ken-liu-interview/">potentially even better</a> in English than in Liu Cixinâ€™s original Chinese.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34068470-the-odyssey">The Odyssey</a>, translated by Emily Wilson. <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/11/best-book-2018.html">Says</a> Tyler Cowen, â€œIt is a joy to read, the best of the five translations I know, and it has received <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=uyf5W6KdI87QrgS54pnQBQ&amp;q=emily+wilson+homer+review&amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;oq=emily+wilson+homer+review&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...66238.70838..71982...0.0..0.0.0.......0....1..gws-wiz.....0.">strong reviews</a> from scholars for its accuracy and fidelity.â€�</li>
</ul>

<p>2. As Veerasamy pointed out to me when I asked him about his cover of Orwell, even original creations are really just â€œassemblages of micro-coversâ€� anyway. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc">Everything is a Remix</a>.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the COVID crisis, the governor of New Jersey <a href="https://www.govtech.com/computing/As-Unemployment-Claims-Spike-New-Jersey-Seeks-COBOL-Coders.html">called for COBOL developers</a> to help the state fix its unemployment insurance systems. The systems were crashing under overwhelming demand, and the culprit seemed to be the decades-old code underpinning the application for benefits. Predictably, critics jumped all over the government for continuing to operate vital systems using a programming language invented more than 50 years ago.</p>

<p>News flash: the C programming language is the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">most popular language</a> in the world and it’s nearly as old as COBOL. SQL is the backbone of database programming, and it was invented in the 1970s. The age of a technology is no indicator of its viability or appropriateness for solving mission-critical problems. The fact that something is old may just mean that it has stood the test of time.</p>

<p>As it turns out, New Jersey ultimately didn’t hire any COBOL developers because <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cant-file-unemployment-dont-blame-cobol/">the problem wasn’t really COBOL</a>, it was actually something more quotidian and less dramatic: the ability to process forms on the internet in a way that scales. The problem New Jersey and other governments have isn’t that they’re using old code or older programming languages. The problem is often that they’re using <strong>code that wasn’t designed to meet the needs of people who use it.</strong></p>

<p>The frustrated users of New Jersey’s unemployment insurance system shouldn’t necessarily blame the errors they encountered on COBOL. They ought to blame them on a system architecture that wasn’t built to handle increased demand, or on an interface that was copied directly from a PDF instead of being designed based on intensive testing with users. Blame them on systems that can’t talk to each other behind the scenes, so they keep asking people to re-enter their information. Blame them on a complex authentication process for tasks that can be done without requiring someone to create an account or sign in.</p>

<h2 id="getting-good-at-online-forms">Getting good at online forms</h2>

<p>Governments need to see themselves as digital services providers, which means investing in the product, user experience, and research skills necessary to understand the problems of people using their services, and the software engineering and operations skills that make the services reliable and available at the time of someone’s needs. Simply putting out a procurement for a new software project will not guarantee that it’s easy-to-use or able to stand up during a huge increase in demand, without requiring these specific capabilities from the delivery team.</p>

<p>To start, governments need to develop competency at putting forms on the internet and having them scale to meet demand, while integrating smoothly with backend systems and office processes. This skill is at the core of nearly all modern government digital services, yet many agencies continue to operate online forms that are the door to vital services but can’t compete with the user experience and reliability of common consumer apps.</p>

<p>Creating online forms that are easy for the public to fill out and easy for office staff to process is absolutely within reach for every government agency if they’re willing to follow the best practices of consumer technology in designing and operating these services.
At Ad Hoc, we start by bringing in product management and user research experts to work closely with agencies to investigate the main problem to solve and define the outcomes agencies are seeking. We take in all the constraints of government from privacy to security to accessibility, and balance those with the researched needs of real users, informing agency stakeholders of the tradeoffs and empowering them to make effective choices. We conduct usability research with people who come to government websites looking for services to find out where they get stuck, and what could be done to make the experience better.</p>

<p>Our research team also spends time with the civil servants who process incoming requests from the public to see where the bottlenecks are in their process and how we can ensure any new public-facing application integrates with their backend systems. That often means we have to integrate new applications with old systems and “old” code like the COBOL in New Jersey’s unemployment insurance system.</p>

<p>User research, both at the beginning of a project and throughout development, informs how our product managers set “north stars”, or shared visions of a future success, and outcome metrics with the government customer. As our engineers and designers create these new services, they’re always working towards outcomes for real people. We ask, how many people were able to enroll in a benefit? How often did the site go down and deny access to the application? We prioritize outcome-based metrics over how many features we shipped, or how many story points we completed, or whether we’re using the latest technology to get the job done.</p>

<h2 id="choose-whats-right-over-whats-old">Choose what’s right over what’s old</h2>

<p>Yes, agencies should evaluate whether their continued investment in COBOL and mainframes makes sense for them in terms of their unique constraints of available budget and technology resources, just as they should continuously examine any system, regardless of its technology stack or the age of particular components, for whether its delivering the outcomes they want within the constraints they have.</p>

<p>Agencies should also fix the errors of the past and invest in new and more efficient technologies. No civil servant should have to print out forms submitted online and re-enter the information into another system. But we must be precise about what needs updating and why, and not be dismissive of technologies merely because of their age.</p>

<p>The so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>” describes how nearly every computer on the planet is designed and operates. It dates back to the mid-1940s and is, for all intents and purposes, unchanged to this day. We would hardly blame New Jersey’s woes on von Neumann computers, just as we shouldn’t blame forms crashing on COBOL code just because it’s old.</p>

                    <p>I was using Arduino IDE and C++ to program my IOT devices built around ESP-12E. But, I was in need of a higher level language to easily manage my HTTP requests from the device as a client; or, create a small web server in the device itself. I found that using Arduino C++ was a bit hard to deal with that. I liked the idea of using Python in ESP8266 so decided to install MicroPython firmware on ESP8266 E-12.</p>
<p>I am using Python 3.7 but Python 2.7 should also work (according to documentation in MicroPython but I haven't tested it)</p>
<p>For the Hello World application we will not to build any electronic circuit as we're using built-in LED. But I assume your ESP-12E is soldered and connected to an FTDI interface.</p>

<h3 id="installingsteps">Installing steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Install Python if not already installed</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install pip3</strong> (or pip if you're on Python 2.7)<br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install esptool</strong><br>
pip3 install esptool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Download MicroPython firmware</strong><br>
<a href="http://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin">http://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Erase flash in your ESP8266</strong> (Update your PORT accordingly)<br>
esptool.py --port PORT3 erase_flash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flash new firmware</strong><br>
esptool.py --port PORT3 --baud 115200 write_flash -fm dio 0x00000 esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If step above doesn't work try changing baud rate</strong> (to 57600 or something else)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install ampy</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/adafruit/ampy" target="_blank">Check their website</a>)<br>
pip3 install adafruit-ampy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upload the blink example using ampy</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Name below file as "main.py"</p>
<pre><code>import machine
import time
led = machine.Pin(2, machine.Pin.OUT)
led.off()
time.sleep(1)
led.on()
time.sleep(1)
led.off()

</code></pre>
<p>and upload using ampy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ampy -d 1 --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 -b 115200 ls</p>

        # By splitting this into 2 reads, it allows boot.py to print stuff,
        # which will show up after the soft reboot and before the raw REPL.
        # Modification from original pyboard.py below:
        #   Add a small delay and send Ctrl-C twice after soft reboot to ensure
        #   any main program loop in main.py is interrupted.

            raise PyboardError('could not enter raw repl')
</code></pre>
<p>After this change I was able to run the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ampy --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 ls</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I can upload the file that I have written in step 9. Let's name this file as "main.py" and upload to ESP8266</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ampy --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 put main.py</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to execute Python commands while connected to ESP8266 as if you were typing commands in IDLE, you can easily setup a serial connection with ESP8266.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>screen /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 115200</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://cuneyt.aliustaoglu.biz/en/content/images/2018/08/screen.gif" alt="screen"></p>
<p>Now that we managed to install our first ever Python application for ESP8266 we're ready to build much more complicated application with the power of Python.</p>

July 10, 2020 | http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2OKF | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2OKF">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>7th January 2020</p>
<p>This is the latest in my series of minimalist watches using 12 LEDs, arranged like a clock face, to show the time analogue-style. This one takes advantage of the fact that Microchip's new 1-series ATtiny microcontrollers incorporate a real-time clock, which can be run from an external crystal to keep accurate time while the main processor is put to sleep:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatimewatch.jpg" alt="MegaTimeWatch.jpg" width="500" height="432"></p>
<p><em>The Mega Tiny Time watch based on an ATtiny414; it's ten to two.</em></p>
<p>To show the time you press the button on the watch face, and it lights up LEDs to show the time like the hour and minute hands on a clock. The LEDs flash to distinguish the hours and minutes, and show intermediate times. The watch keeps time to within a few seconds a month, while giving a battery life of several years.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My earlier&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1MG3">Tiny Time 2 Watch</a>&nbsp;used Maxim Integrated's DS2417 RTC chip to keep time while the processor was put to sleep, to save power. Since I designed that, Microchip have released their 1-series ATtiny chips that incorporate a crystal-controlled real-time clock; this can keep time while the processor is asleep, avoiding the need for a separate RTC chip. Spence Konde calls these the "Mega Tiny" range; hence the name of this watch.</p>
<p>I based this watch on the 14-pin ATtiny414, which has 4K bytes of flash memory, and has an RTC peripheral that supports an external crystal. In this design there are a few I/O pins spare, so you could extend the watch with other features; see <a href="#further-suggestions">Further suggestions</a> below.</p>
<p>As with my earlier watch, to show the time you press the button on the watch face, and the time is then displayed for five seconds. It lights one LED to show the hour, and flashes one or two other LEDs to show the minutes to the nearest minute by altering the rate at which each of the LEDs flash. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watchexamples.gif" alt="WatchExamples.gif" width="527" height="206"></p>
<p><em>Examples of how the Mega Tiny Time watch displays the time.</em></p>
<p>For consistency with analogue watches, the Tiny Time Watch displays times later than half past the hour by lighting the next hour number. If only one LED lights up you know that both hands are pointing to the same hour mark.</p>
<p>The total power consumption with no display is just 1µA, giving an estimated battery life of over 10 years from a single CR2016 battery! Obviously this is reduced if you check the time frequently.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the circuit of the Tiny Time 2 watch, laid out like the circuit board:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watchtinymega.gif" alt="WatchTinyMega.gif" width="642" height="547"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the ATtiny414-based Mega Tiny Time watch.</em></p>
<p>The crystal is a standard&nbsp;32.768 kHz quartz watch crystal; I chose a MS1V-T1K micro crystal&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, but I expect any&nbsp;32.768 kHz&nbsp;crystal would be suitable. A 3.2 X 1.5 mm SMD crystal would also fit across the pads on the PCB.</p>
<p>The LEDs are 0805 size, and for this version of the watch I chose white LEDs to contrast with the black circuit board. I got mine from Bright Components in the UK, who sell them for under £1 for ten&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>. Any colour LED should be fine, but they should all be the same colour.</p>
<p>I arranged the LEDs to simplify the PCB layout which explains the rather haphazard order, but this is easily accommodated by an array in the software. The following table shows which LED lights up when you take one I/O line high and the other I/O line low:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watch3leds.gif" alt="Watch3LEDs.gif" width="243" height="167"></p>
<p>The button is a miniature SMD push button available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>, available from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The battery is a 20mm coin cell. Given the low current consumption I decided to use the slimmer CR2016 cell, and found a suitable SMD battery holder on Mouser <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>. Alternatively you could use a CR2032 battery, with an SMD 20mm coin cell holder available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>, or from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>NOTE: If a child could play with this watch please bend the tabs on the coin cell holder, or glue in the coin cell, so the cell can't be removed and swallowed.</p>
<h4>â–º Parts list</h4>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>I designed the board in Eagle and sent it to PCBWay for fabrication.&nbsp;Here's the layout (from the OSH Park preview):</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimewatchpcb.gif" alt="MegaTinyTimeWatchPCB.gif" width="441" height="250"></p>
<p>See the end of the article for links to download the board files or order a board.</p>
<p>I built the watch using SMD components, with all the components apart from the battery holder soldered to the front of the board. The ATtiny414 was SOIC, and I used 0805 resistors and LEDs, so they should be relatively easy to solder by hand:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimefront.jpg" alt="MegaTinyTimeFront.jpg" width="290" height="330"><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimeback.jpg" alt="MegaTinyTimeBack.jpg" width="290" height="330"></p>
<p><em>The front and back of the completed Mega Tiny Time watch circuit board.</em></p>
<p>The LEDs should all be soldered with the same orientation, with the negative sides facing the centre of the board.</p>
<p>I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun at 250°C to solder the SMD components onto the front of the board, and then finally soldered the battery holder onto the back of the board using a conventional soldering iron. If you don't have a hot air gun you should be able to solder the SMD components with a bit of care using a fine-tipped soldering iron.</p>
<p>I found a suitable 12mm wide thread-through watch strap from a German supplier <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>This section explains the various sections of the Tiny Time Watch program.</p>
<h4>Real-Time Clock</h4>
<p>As in my earlier project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2RA3">New ATtiny Low Power</a>, the aim is to keep the processor asleep most of the time to minimise the watch's power consumption.</p>
<p>From the ATtiny414 datasheet I realised that there were two possible ways to use the 1-series ATtiny Real-Time Clock peripheral in this application. It could run as a Real-Time Counter, keeping a 16-bit count of the number of elapsed seconds in the RTC CNT Count register while the processor stays asleep. Alternatively it could run as a Periodic Interrupt Timer (PIT), generating an interrupt to wake up the processor briefly every second and increment a variable to count the number of seconds.</p>
<p>In theory the CNT approach should give slightly lower power consumption, because the processor only needs to be woken up when you're displaying the time, but I couldn't get it to work; the CNT register didn't seem to get incremented when the processor was asleep. However, the PIT approach worked perfectly, and the difference in power consumption is probably minimal. If I get the CNT method working I'll post it as an update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up the RTC to use an external crystal is more complicated than you might expect, because the Clock Controller is protected from accidental change by Configuration Change Protection (CCP), so before each change you have to enable the action first. Fortunately there's an application note that explains how to do this, and my code is based on one of the examples in that note <sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>The display</h4>
<p>The 12 LEDs are driven by the four I/O lines PA1, PA4, PPA5, and PA6. The array Pin[6][6] specifies how the LEDs are connected to the five I/O lines:</p>
<pre>int Pins[6][6] = {{ -1, -1, -1,  8,  6,  4 },
                  { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 },
                  { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 },
                  {  7, -1, -1, -1, 11,  9 },
                  {  0, -1, -1, 10, -1,  2 },
                  {  5, -1, -1,  3,  1, -1 }};</pre>
<p>The first row of the array specifies which LEDs have their cathodes connected to PA1: the LED at 8 o'clock has its anode connected to PA4, the LED at 6 o'clock has its anode connected to PA5, and the LED at 4 o'clock has its anode connected to PA6. The values in the array corresponding to PA2 and PA3 are set to -1, as these aren't connected to any LEDs; it was simpler to use a larger array than write code to compensate for this.</p>
<p>I used Timer/Counter TCB running at 250 Hz to multiplex the display. This is set up by the routine <strong>DisplaySetup()</strong> as follows:</p>
<pre>void DisplaySetup () {
  // Set up Timer/Counter TCB to multiplex the display
  TCB0.CCMP = 19999;                                  // Divide 5MHz by 20000 = 250Hz
  TCB0.CTRLA = TCB_CLKSEL_CLKDIV1_gc | TCB_ENABLE_bm; // Enable timer, divide by 1
  TCB0.CTRLB = 0;                                     // Periodic Interrupt Mode
  TCB0.INTCTRL = TCB_CAPT_bm;                         // Enable interrupt
}</pre>
<p>The interrupt service routine simply calls <strong>DisplayNextRow()</strong>, decrements the global variable <strong>Timeout,</strong> and increments the global variable <strong>Offset</strong> used when initially setting the time:</p>
<pre>ISR(TCB0_INT_vect) {
  TCB0.INTFLAGS = TCB_CAPT_bm;                        // Clear the interrupt flag
  DisplayNextRow();
  Timeout--;
  Offset++;
}</pre>
<p>Two additional routines are used to turn the display on and off:</p>
<pre>void DisplayOn () {
  // Turn off all the pullups
  PORTA.PIN0CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN1CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN4CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN5CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN6CTRL = 0;
  TCB0.INTCTRL = TCB_CAPT_bm;                         // Enable interrupt
}

void DisplayOff () {
  TCB0.INTCTRL = 0;                                   // Disable interrupt
  PORTA.DIR = 0;                                      // All PORTA pins inputs
  // Turn on all the pullups for minimal power in sleep
  PORTA.PIN0CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;                  // UPDI
  PORTA.PIN1CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN4CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN5CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN6CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
}</pre>
<h4>Display multiplexing</h4>
<p>The routine <strong>DisplayNextRow()</strong> works as follows:</p>
<pre>void DisplayNextRow() {
  Cycle++;
  uint8_t row = Cycle &amp; 0x03;
  if (row &gt; 0) row = row + 2;                         // Skip PA2 and PA3
  uint8_t bits = 0;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;6; i++) {
    if (Hours == Pins[row][i]) bits = bits | 1&lt;&lt;(i+1);
    if (Fivemins == Pins[row][i]) bits = bits | 1&lt;&lt;(i+1);
  }
  PORTA.DIR = 1&lt;&lt;(row+1) | bits;                      // Make outputs for lit LED
  PORTA.OUT = bits;                                   // Set outputs high
}
</pre>

<p>Up to two LEDs can be lit at once. The LED specified by the variable <strong>Hours</strong> is used to show the hours, and is displayed continuously. The LED specified by the variable&nbsp;<strong>Fivemins</strong>&nbsp;is used for the minutes.</p>
<p>The bottom two bits of the variable <strong>Cycle</strong> determine which row is being displayed. For a given row the array <strong>Pins[row][i]</strong> is checked to see if any of the LEDs in that row need to be displayed. If so, the appropriate bits are set in the variable <strong>bits</strong>. This is then written to the port.</p>
<p>To test the the LEDs you can run the following&nbsp;<strong>loop()</strong> function instead of …</p></div></div>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on July 09, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's blog post is about solving the "Plus-Minus"
problem in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force
solution</a> using the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html">itertools</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html">operator</a> modules.</li>
<li>How to create a more efficient solution by noticing hidden structure within
the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are given a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">positive number</a>
<var>n</var>.
Your goal is to find a way to add and subtract the numbers
from 1 to <var>n</var> to make 0.</p>
<p>E.g. <var>n</var> = 4 and a solution is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0 = 1 - 2 - 3 + 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a given <var>n</var> it may be impossible to find a
solution.</p>

<p>I represent the solution as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">list</a> of the numbers 1 to
<var>n</var>, each number being positive or negative (to represent addition or
subtraction).
E.g. the solution "1 - 2 - 3 + 4" is represented as</p>
<pre><code>[1, -2, -3, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>If a solution cannot be found, I use the value
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">None</a>.</p>

<p>A simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a> will attempt every
possible way to add and subtract the numbers.
Here's a Python function that does that:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import product
from operator import pos, neg


def plus_minus_bf(*, n):
    """Solve the 'Plus Minus' problem using brute force."""
    assert n &gt; 0
    unsigned_nums = range(1, n + 1)
    for signs in product([pos, neg], repeat=n):
        signed_nums = [
            sign(num)
            for sign, num in zip(signs, unsigned_nums)
        ]
        if sum(signed_nums) == 0:
            return signed_nums
</code></pre>
<p>This code starts with a range of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness">unsigned
numbers</a> and "signs" the numbers by
using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.pos">operator.pos</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.neg">operator.neg</a>.
The code uses
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product">itertools.product</a>
to generate all possible ways to mark the numbers in <code>unsigned_nums</code> as
positive (being added) or negative (being subtracted).
Here are solutions for <var>n</var> = 1 to <var>n</var> = 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print("n   Solution")
print("--  --------")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{i:2}  {plus_minus_bf(n=i)}")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n   Solution
--  --------
 1  None
 2  None
 3  [1, 2, -3]
 4  [1, -2, -3, 4]
 5  None
 6  None
 7  [1, 2, -3, 4, -5, -6, 7]
 8  [1, 2, 3, 4, -5, -6, -7, 8]
 9  None
10  None
</code></pre>
<p>What's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of
this function?
For a positive integer <var>n</var>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 2<sup><var>n</var></sup> ways to add and
subtract the numbers 1 to <var>n</var>.</li>
<li>Signing the unsigned numbers and checking that the signed
numbers sum to 0 takes O(<var>n</var>) operations, because
the list of <var>n</var> numbers is looped over.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the overall time complexity of the function is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var> 2<sup><var>n</var></sup>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To create a more efficient solution, I look more closely at
the structure of the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have the numbers 1 to <var>n</var>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider any 4 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_sequence">consecutive</a> numbers</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>i</var>, <var>i</var>+1, <var>i</var>+2,
<var>i</var>+3</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's true that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<var>i</var>) - (<var>i</var>+1) - (<var>i</var>+2) +
(<var>i</var>+3) = 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I call this <strong>the pattern.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, I can solve the problem if
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat <strong>the pattern</strong> <var>k</var> times to cover all the
numbers from 1 to <var>n</var>.</li>
<li>The additions and subtractions will total to 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I can solve the problem if <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+3:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-1 - 2 + 3 ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This totals to 0.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat <strong>the pattern</strong> <var>k</var> times to cover all the
numbers from 1 to <var>n</var>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The additions and subtractions will total to 0.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But, what if <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+1 or
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+2?
There is no solution.
Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a given <var>n</var>, I want to divide the numbers 1
to <var>n</var> into two
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">sets</a>, the pluses
<var>P</var> and the minuses <var>M</var>, so that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) - sum(<var>M</var>) = 0</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) = 2
sum(<var>M</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) is even</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>The numbers 1 to <var>n</var> are divided between
<var>P</var> and <var>M</var>, so</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) = 1 + 2 + ... +
<var>n</var></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sum is called the <var>n</var>-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number">triangular
number</a> and has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression">closed
form expression</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 + 2 + ... + <var>n</var> = <var>n</var>(<var>n</var> +
1)/2</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) =
<var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1)/2</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) is even</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1)/2 must be even</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1)/2 must be divisible by 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1) must be divisible by 4</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> or <var>n</var> + 1 is divisible by 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is only true when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var> + 3</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that there is no solution when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var> + 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var> + 2</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a Python function that implements this faster
algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import cycle, chain
from operator import pos, neg


def plus_minus_fast(*, n):
    """Efficiently solve the 'Plus Minus' problem."""
    assert n &gt; 0

    rem = n % 4
    if rem == 1 or rem == 2:
        return None

    pattern = [pos, neg, neg, pos]
    if rem == 0:
        signs = cycle(pattern)
    elif rem == 3:
        signs = chain([neg, neg, pos], cycle(pattern))

    unsigned_nums = range(1, n + 1)
    signed_nums = [
        sign(num) for sign, num in zip(signs, unsigned_nums)
    ]
    return signed_nums
</code></pre>
<p>This code uses
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle">itertools.cycle</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain">itertools.chain</a>
to construct the sequence of signs.
<code>cycle()</code> actually creates an infinite <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Iterator">iterator</a>, but this
isn't a problem because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip">zip</a> truncates the iterator to
the length of <code>unsigned_nums</code>.</p>
<p>Here are solutions for <var>n</var> = 1 to <var>n</var> = 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print("n   Solution")
print("--  --------")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{i:2}  {plus_minus_fast(n=i)}")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n   Solution
--  --------
 1  None
 2  None
 3  [-1, -2, 3]
 4  [1, -2, -3, 4]
 5  None
 6  None
 7  [-1, -2, 3, 4, -5, -6, 7]
 8  [1, -2, -3, 4, 5, -6, -7, 8]
 9  None
10  None
</code></pre>
<p>What's the time complexity of this algorithm?
For a positive integer <var>n</var>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+1 or
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+2, then the function
immediately returns, taking O(1) steps.</li>
<li>Otherwise, <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var> or
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+3.

You learned how to create a brute force solution using the itertools and
operator modules.
And you learned how to create a more efficient solution by noticing hidden
structure in the problem.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are given positive numbers <var>n</var> and <var>m</var>.
Write a program that finds a way to add and subtract the numbers from 1 to
<var>n</var> to make <var>m</var>.</p>

				<p>This is a short guide describing the latency implications of the virtual memory
abstraction. If you are building systems requiring low and predictable latency
such as realtime audio processing, control and high frequency trading (HFT) /
algorithmic trading systems this guide will be useful to you. It is written from
the perspective Linux kernel running on AMD64 / x86-64 architecture, but the
general concepts applies to most operating systems and CPU architectures.</p>
<p>In summary to minimize latency introduced by the virtual memory abstraction you
should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize page faults by pre-faulting, locking and pre-allocating needed
memory. Disable swap.</li>
<li>Reduce TLB misses by minimizing your working set memory and utilizing huge
pages.</li>
<li>Prevent TLB shootdowns by not modifying your programs page tables after
startup.</li>
<li>Prevent stalls due to page cache writeback by not creating file backed
writable memory mappings.</li>
<li>Disable Linux transparent huge pages (THP) background defragmentation.</li>
<li>Disable Linux kernel samepage merging (KSM).</li>
<li>Disable Linux automatic NUMA balancing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-faults">Page faults</h2>
<p>When reading or writing to file backed memory that is not in the <em>page
cache</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> or to <em>anonymous memory</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> that has been swapped out,
the kernel must first load the data from the underlying storage device. This is
called a major page fault and incurs a similar overhead as issuing a <code>read</code> or
<code>write</code> system call.</p>
<p>If the page is already in the page cache you will still incur a minor page fault
on first access after calling <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><code>mmap</code></a>, during which the page table is
updated to point to the correct page. For anonymous memory there will also be a
minor page fault on first write access, when a anonymous page is allocated,
zeroed and the page table updated<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Basically memory mappings are lazily
initialized on first use. Note also that access to the page table during a page
fault is protected by locks leading to scalability issues in multi-threaded
applications<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To avoid page faults you can pre-fault and disable page cache eviction of the
needed memory using the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html"><code>mlock</code></a> system call or the <code>MAP_LOCKED</code> and
<code>MAP_POPULATE</code> flags to <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><code>mmap</code></a>. You can also disable swap system wide to
prevent anonymous memory from being swapped to disk.</p>
<p>You can monitor number of page faults using</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">ps -eo min_flt,maj_flt,cmd
</code></pre><p>or</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">perf stat -e faults,minor-faults,major-faults
</code></pre><h2 id="tlb-misses">TLB misses</h2>
<p>The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer">translation lookaside buffer (TLB)</a>
is a on CPU cache that maps virtual to physical addresses. These mappings are
maintained for pages typically of size 4 KiB, 2/4 MiB or 1 GiB. Usually there
are separate TLBs for data (DTLB) and instructions (ITLB) with a shared second
level TLB (STLB)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. The TLB has a limited number of entries and if a
address is not found in the TLB or STLB, the page table data in the CPU caches
or main memory needs to be referenced, this is called a TLB miss. The same as a
CPU cache miss is more expensive than a cache hit, a TLB miss is more expensive
than a TLB hit.</p>
<p>You can minimize TLB misses by reducing your working set size, making sure to
pack your data into as few pages as possible. Additionally you can utilize
larger page sizes than the default 4 KiB. These larger pages are called <em>huge
pages</em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and allows you to reference more data using fewer pages.</p>
<p>TLB usage can be monitored using:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">perf stat -e dTLB-loads,dTLB-load-misses,iTLB-loads,iTLB-load-misses
</code></pre><h2 id="tlb-shootdowns">TLB shootdowns</h2>
<p>Most processors do not provide coherence guarantees for TLB mappings. Instead
the kernel provides this guarantee using a mechanism called <em>TLB shootdown</em>. It
operates by sending inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) that runs kernel code to
invalidate the stale TLB entries<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. <em>TLB shootdowns</em> causes each affected
core to context switch into the kernel and thus causes latency spikes for the
process running on the affected cores. It will also cause TLB misses when a
address with an invalidated page table entry is subsequently accessed.</p>
<p>Any operation that narrows a process’ access to memory like <code>munmap</code> and
<code>mprotect</code> will cause a TLB shootdown. Calls to the C standard library allocator
(<code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, etc) will call <code>madvise(...MADV_FREE)</code>/<code>munmap</code> internally,
but not necessarily on each invocation. TLB shootdowns will also occur during
page cache writeback.</p>
<p>To avoid TLB shootdowns you can map all needed memory at program startup and
avoid calling any functions that modifies the page table after that. The
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc">mimalloc allocator</a> can be tuned to
allocate huge pages at program startup (<code>MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES=N</code>) and
never return memory to the OS (<code>MIMALLOC_PAGE_RESET=0</code>).</p>
<p>You can monitor the number of TLB shootdowns in <code>/proc/interrupts</code>.</p>
<h2 id="page-cache-writeback">Page cache writeback</h2>
<p>When a page in the <em>page cache</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> has been modified it is marked as
dirty and needs to be eventually written back to disk. This process is called
writeback and is triggered automatically on a timer or when specifically
requested using the system calls <code>fsync</code>, <code>fdatasync</code>, <code>sync</code>, <code>syncfs</code>,
<code>msync</code>, and others. If any of the dirty pages are part of a writable memory
mapping, the writeback process must first update the page table to mark the page
as read-only before writing it to disk. Any subsequent memory write to the page
will cause a page fault, letting the kernel update the page cache state to dirty
and mark the page writable again. In practice this means that writeback causes
TLB shootdowns and that writes to pages that are currently being written to disk
must stall until the disk write is complete. This leads to latency spikes for
any process that is using <em>file backed writable memory mappings</em>.</p>
<p>To avoid latency spikes due to <em>page cache writeback</em> you cannot create any file
backed writable memory mappings. Creating anonymous writable memory mappings
using <code>mmap(...MAP_ANONYMOUS)</code> or by mapping files on
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/tmpfs.html">Linux <em>tmpfs</em> filesystem</a>
is fine.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://rigtorp.se/writeback.cpp">small program to demonstrate this effect</a>.</p>
<h2 id="transparent-hugepages">Transparent hugepages</h2>
<p>On
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html">Linux <em>transparent huge page</em> (THP) support</a>
should cause TLB shootdowns when memory regions are compacted / defragmented,
but I have not verified that.</p>
<p>THP can be beneficial for reducing TLB misses, but you should disable
<em>khugepaged</em> background defragmentation to avoid any latency spikes due to the
defragmentation process:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">echo 0 &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/defrag
</code></pre><p>There is some ongoing work to support THP for excutables:
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/789159/">https://lwn.net/Articles/789159/</a></p>
<h2 id="kernel-samepage-merging">Kernel samepage merging</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/ksm.html">Linux kernel samepage merging (KSM)</a>
is a feature that can de-duplicate pages with identical data. The merging
process will lead to TLB shootdowns and unpredictable memory access latencies.</p>
<p>Make sure kernel samepage merging (KSM) is disabled.</p>
<h2 id="numa-and-page-migration">NUMA and Page migration</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/vm/numa.html">Non-uniform memory access (NUMA)</a> occurs when the memory access time
varies with memory location and processor core. You need to take this into
account when designing your system.</p>
<p>On Linux you can use <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cpusets.html">cpusets</a>, <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/numactl.8.html"><code>numactl</code></a>,
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html"><code>set_mempolicy</code></a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mbind.2.html"><code>mbind</code></a> to control the NUMA node
memory placement policy.</p>
<p>Additionally Linux supports
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_tuning_and_optimization_guide/sect-virtualization_tuning_optimization_guide-numa-auto_numa_balancing">automatic migration of memory between NUMA nodes</a>.
The automatic NUMA balancing will cause page faults and TLB shootdowns and
should be disabled:</p>

<p>“The physical memory is volatile and the common case for getting data into
the memory is to read it from files. Whenever a file is read, the data is
put into the page cache to avoid expensive disk access on the subsequent
reads. Similarly, when one writes to a file, the data is placed in the page
cache and eventually gets into the backing storage device. The written pages
are marked as dirty and when Linux decides to reuse them for other purposes,
it makes sure to synchronize the file contents on the device with the
updated data.”

<p>“The anonymous memory or anonymous mappings represent memory that is not
backed by a filesystem. Such mappings are implicitly created for program’s
stack and heap or by explicit calls to mmap(2) system call. Usually, the
anonymous mappings only define virtual memory areas that the program is
allowed to access. The read accesses will result in creation of a page table
entry that references a special physical page filled with zeroes. When the
program performs a write, a regular physical page will be allocated to hold
the written data. The page will be marked dirty and if the kernel decides to
repurpose it, the dirty page will be swapped out.”

    <h2>Product Description</h2>
<p>The CDATA OLTs are OEM FTTH OLTs, sold under different brands (Cdata, OptiLink, V-SOL CN, BLIY), allowing to provide FTTH connectivity to a large number of clients (using ONTs).
Some of the devices support multiple 10-gigabit uplinks and provide Internet connectivity to up to 1024 ONTs (clients).</p>
<p>We validated the vulnerabilities against FD1104B and FD1108SN OLTs in our lab environment with the latest firmware versions (V1.2.2 and 2.4.05_000, 2.4.04_001 and 2.4.03_000).
<img alt="" src="https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/images/2020-olt.jpg"></p>
<p>Using static analysis, these vulnerabilities also appear to affect all available OLT models as the codebase is similar:</p>
<ul>
<li>72408A</li>
<li>9008A</li>
<li>9016A</li>

<h2>Details - Backdoor Access with telnet</h2>
<p>A telnet server is running in the appliance and is reachable from the WAN interface and from the FTTH LAN interface (from the ONTs).</p>
<p>Depending on the firmware, the backdoor credentials may change. You can find below a complete list of backdoor (undocumented) credentials, giving an attacker a complete administrator CLI access.</p>
<p>Previous and old versions can be abused with:</p>
<pre><code>login: suma123
password: panger123
</code></pre>
<p>New recent versions can be abused with:</p>
<pre><code>login: debug
password: debug124

login: root
password: root126

login: guest
password: [empty]
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/images/2020-olt-sub_7740A4.png">
</p><center>Authentication process with hardcoded credentials</center>
<p>The credentials have been extracted from old and new firmware images.</p>
<p>About the credentials, it depends on the vendors and the version of the firmware - the appearance of the CLI may be different but the access still works.</p>

<p><em>Sometimes you’re bored on a Friday night. Sometimes you think of data visualization on a Friday night. Sometimes you think of (or, better yet, eat) dumplings on a Friday night.</em> <em>And sometimes, you do all of the above.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="dumplings">

<p>I am a fan of dumplings. Bread-type foods are awesome. Filled foods are awesome. Filled bread is awesome (if you’ve never had a Georgian <em>lobiani</em>, you’re missing out!). A dumpling, though not necessarily having to be filled, combines a lot of this. In <em>my</em> world, a dumpling is normally cooked in some liquid though – that is, boiled, simmered, steamed, or deep-fried, rather than, say, baked. We’ll come back to this.</p>
<p>I work as a researcher in linguistics, and I’m interested in comparing different languages. How are they similar and how are they different? Sometimes, I use multidimensional scaling (MDS) as a way of comparing such similarities or differences. Anyway, on this particular Friday night (August 23rd, 2019), I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/Laserhedvig/status/1164794499324772354">Twitter post</a> mentioning a “dumpling party” (omg, that in itself = love), at which one person had brought Italian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arancini"><em>arancini</em></a>, which received “mixed reception” by the other guests. So I started thinking, <em>what defines a “dumpling”, and can you group them based on various features</em>. Turns out <a href="https://twitter.com/emilymbender">Emily Bender et al.</a> had already established a definition of <em>dumpling</em> at their website promoting the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/idop-idod/idod"><em>International Day of Dumplings</em></a> – I did not know of this as of this particular Friday night.</p>
<p>At this point, I thought <em>what if I just look up some dumplings on Wikipedia, and code some of the specific features for each one?</em> This could allow me to plot them in two-dimensional space using MDS methods. I was intrigued by the possible outcome, so I started reading through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Wikipedia article “Dumpling”</a>…</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling">

<p>My method wasn’t very sophisticated. I started by scrolling through the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Dumpling</a>, and basically took each item that had its own article (I may have missed a few), transferred it to a spreadsheet, and started adding some columns for particular features. As I started getting more items, the number of features grew, and I have to be honest, they are far from perfect and just things that I thought of on the spot. A <em>much better</em> analysis could easily be done with a bit more sophistication, time, and systematicity. I mean, this was after all just a random Friday night and I was already past my bed time…</p>
<p>In the end, I collected data from 61 different dumplings. Note that when I say different, this categorization is not at all well-defined. I tried to exclude duplicates for which even the names themselves were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate"><em>cognates</em></a>. Chinese <em>jiǎozi (餃子)</em> is related to Japanese <em>gyōza (ギョーザ)</em> and thus only the former was included. However, in the case of German <em>Knödel</em> and Czech <em>knedlík</em>, I decided to include both simply based on the fact that whereas the former was listed as potentially being served with a sweet filling, I did not observe this with the latter – NB: I promise this wasn’t a biased decision (see the <a href="#bonus">Bonus</a> section).</p>
<p>Beyond the dumplings sampled according to the above criteria, I also included a few items not traditionally seen as dumplings, because I wanted to see how they patterned with the dumplings proper. These items include <em>calzone</em>, <em>bitterballen</em>, and – of course – <em>arancini</em>. The resulting sample of 61 items can be seen below.</p>

<p>The features that I ended up settling on amounted to 15 different ones. Some are related but not mutually exclusive. The concern mainly content, form, and preparation. Some dumplings can be prepared in several ways (e.g., either <em>boiled</em> or <em>steamed</em>) and may be either <em>sweet</em> or <em>savory</em>; others seem to be more strict with regard to some of these features.</p>

<h3>Dumpling features</h3>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flour</strong>: <em>Is flour (any type) used in the dough?</em></li>
<li><strong>Bread</strong>: <em>Are bread bits or breadcrumbs added?</em></li>
<li><strong>Battered</strong>: <em>Is the dough battered (or itself a batter) before prepared?</em></li>
<li><strong>Starch</strong>: <em>Is any starchy produce added to the dough (e.g., potatoes)</em></li>
<li><strong>Plain</strong>: <em>Does it occur without filling?</em></li>
<li><strong>Filled</strong>: <em>Does it occur with filling?</em></li>
<li><strong>Thick</strong>: <em>Is the doughy coating “thick” (yes, this is quite subjective)</em></li>
<li><strong>Boiled</strong>: <em>Can it be boiled?</em></li>
<li><strong>Steamed</strong>: <em>Can it be steamed?</em></li>
<li><strong>DeepFried</strong>: <em>Can it be deep-fried?</em></li>
<li><strong>Fried</strong>: <em>Can it be fried (e.g., in a pan or a grill)?</em></li>
<li><strong>Baked</strong>: <em>Can it be baked (e.g., in an oven)?</em></li>
<li><strong>Raw</strong>: <em>Can it be served basically as is?</em></li>
<li><strong>Sweet</strong>: <em>Is it sweet?</em></li>
<li><strong>Savory</strong>: <em>Is it savory?</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Each dumpling was assigned a binary value (0 or 1) per feature, resulting in the below table – again, not that this was not very serious work on a Friday night and I was tired; errors are to be expected (but feel free to re-work this yourself if you feel like it!).</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>It's been <a href="https://blog.chartmogul.com/firing-customers/">4 months since I wrote a blog post</a>. I've been keeping busy. Today I just feel like I have a lot to say so here's an update about what's on my mind and the challenges I'm working through at this stage in my business.</p><p>Imagine making money while you sleep, never waking up to an alarm clock, and planning out your schedule each week to work on the things that you want to work on. You spend your time reading books, programming, talking with people about their businesses each day, and researching things that you find interesting, not because you need to make money, but just because it's fun.</p><p>This is my life right now. I'm 27 years old and I guess this is what it feels like to be retired? I run a <a href="https://hostifi.net/">small online business</a>, own a small house in a small town in Michigan. I bought it cash a few months ago. No debt, hardly any bills. I live with my fiancee. We've got 10 acres of land, a few dogs. We're taking care of some puppies and kittens right now until we find homes for them. We like to drive around in the woods on ATVs, have huge bonfires, barbecue, swim in our pool, and work on projects around the house. We're living the <a href="https://twitter.com/tylertringas/status/1213183942880153600?s=20">New American Dream</a>™.</p><p>I have more wealth, freedom, and happiness now than I've ever had before.</p><p>I can't really put into words how good it feels, and how grateful I am everyday for all of the people and my customers who helped me get here. Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tylertringas">Tyler Tringas</a>, everyone in <a href="https://blog.rchase.com/374k-arr-update/earnestcapital.com">Earnest Capital</a>, my fiancee Emily, and my right-hand man <a href="https://twitter.com/Ersafcr7">Safwan Shaikh</a>.</p><p>The business made over $30,000 in revenue last month, but I'm not upgrading my lifestyle with each uptick. Quite the opposite actually. Having a business really changed my outlook on money.</p><p>The lower I can keep my personal burn rate, the more money I can put into the business, the faster it can grow, the bigger the impact it can have. That results in more interesting things I can then build with the money it makes. The lower my expenses are, the less bad feelings like stress, fear, worry, the longer I can live off of savings if my business revenue dries up for some reason and I need to pivot.</p><p>I just want to be able to keep creating and learning new things, being in control of my life, and not dependent on any one customer or employer.</p><p>I've had my share of lucky breaks along the way. From starting a software service that is following in the success of Ubiquiti's growth, to getting fired from my job which pushed me into the business full-time, being accepted into Earnest Capital, and convincing Safwan Shaikh to quit Ubiquiti to come work for my tiny startup. All of those things were out of my control, and had a really big impact which helped get me to where I'm at.</p><p>But of course it also wasn't all luck. Two and a half years ago, when I started on this journey, I had no idea everything would happen so fast. But I did know it would happen eventually. I built the business very intentionally at each step, with the outcome in mind from the start that it was going to make me more money than I could make at my job as a Security Analyst, take less of my time, and would be both a scalable and sellable asset.</p><p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Fastlane-Crack-Wealth-Lifetime/dp/0984358102">The Millionaire Fastlane</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mjdemarco">M.J. DeMarco</a> which originally taught me about separating time from money with a product or software business. After that I decided to start a SaaS business, and followed closely in the footsteps of the path that Tyler Tringas had blazed with <a href="https://tylertringas.com/storemapper/">Storemapper</a> by reading his <a href="https://tylertringas.com/micro-saas-ebook/">Micro-SaaS Ebook</a>. Later on, I learned what it was going to take to remove myself from the day to day operation of my business by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Built-Sell-Creating-Business-Without/dp/1591845823">Built to Sell</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280">The E-Myth Revisited</a>.</p><p>Today I'm at that place that I wanted to get to when I started on the journey. I have a business where I'm not trading my time for money, it's scalable, and although I have no plans to sell it, it is also sellable. It's an asset worth around $1M right now. I work on the business about 40 hours per week usually, but I really only have to work on it an hour a day or less if I want to (and sometimes I do).</p><p>I put that to the test over the last two weeks to see how much I actually am required for anything on a day to day basis. I stopped doing support entirely to see what would happen. This gave me an opportunity to uncover any problems with our processes. </p><p>What can't my support employee Safwan do without me, and how do I fix it so he can do those things? </p><p>I had to do it because I've been busy these last few weeks, focused on Python development. We're building a new website platform and I'm writing scripts for the Laravel backend that Romega Digital has been developing for us. </p><p>In addition to stepping out of managing support, I changed my calendar so I only do sales demos on Tuesdays and Thursdays that way I can have more uninterrupted time to write code.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png 835w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Normally I log in each day to our ticket system Intercom and I work alongside Safwan. I read everything that goes on, assign tickets to him, leave notes, close tickets. I realized I've been managing too much. I don't actually need to do all of that. He's been working here almost a year now and he knows all the processes inside and out, I don't need to manage every ticket coming through.</p><p>Two weeks ago I told him. I'm not logging into Intercom any more. If there's a ticket that you need my help with, assign it to me and Slack me to remind me to look into it. I'm not answering the support phone any more either, so keep an eye on that and call back on any voicemails that come in.</p><p>He's been totally on his own! Instead of me logging in each day and assigning tickets to him, and closing tickets, it was up to him to keep the ticket queue clean, make notes, and assign tickets to me if needed.</p><p>He did a great job and of course I thought, why didn't I do this sooner? I think I felt I had to always be there to make sure it was being done right, which is probably valid when you hire someone new, but he knows what he's doing now and has for a long time already.</p><p>Whenever a ticket did get escalated to me, and it's been only a couple over the last two weeks, I've made a note of it. There are certain things he doesn't have access to be able to fix for a ticket and I need to work on creating systems where he can get access to those edge case things without needing me.</p><p>The ultimate goal is for me to be able to step away for weeks and nothing bad happen during that time.</p><p>This week I started thinking again about the org chart in the E-Myth Revisited. The book said you should stop thinking about yourself as one person doing everything, and create an org chart for your business, splitting up roles that will someday be filled by actual employees. Write your name on each role for now, and later figure out how to fill each of them.</p><p>Here's my org chart for HostiFi right now:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-1.png 1000w, https://blog.rchase.com/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png 1150w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the beginning I was doing everything - "CEO", development, marketing, support, sales, and accounting. Last summer I hired Safwan Shaikh to take over the support role. Shortly after that I hired Pilot.com to do our books. Then I hired Romega Digital around November of last year to take over design and most of the development department. They're building a new Laravel website for us. Since then I've been putting &nbsp;my effort into the other roles - "CEO" (managing Romega Digital and Safwan), marketing (social media, podcasts, blog posts), sales (doing demos over Zoom), and some Python development.</p><p>Handing off roles was not easy. I first had to learn them inside and out on my own, and then develop step by step processes for how to handle all the things that come up within that role. <a href="https://blog.rchase.com/growing-my-saas-from-solo-founder-to-1-employee/">I wrote about how I did that for the support role</a>. </p><p>For the development role, I was looking to make a full-time hire for that as well last November, but I ended up hiring Romega Digital because I didn't know enough about that side of the business to be able to create the right processes and I knew I needed help fast. With their help, they've built a strong foundation for our new website and now will be able to teach me how it works. Hopefully soon I'll be able to hire someone full-time once I understand it better. That person will probably need to be senior level to make up for the fact that it's not my strongest area though. I'm hoping to hire one person who can do Laravel, Python, and frontend but it might need to be broken down into two or three different roles with one full-time, one part-time or still outsourced.</p><p>With the accounting role, I'm not an expert there either and don't want to be, I'm happy to outsource that role indefinitely and Pilot.com has been doing a good job with it.</p><p>Sales and marketing are roles that I still need to develop into processes and hand off eventually, but we're growing so fast without a lot of effort there right now that it's just not a priority.</p><p>Well, that's pretty much what it's like being at this stage with the business. I really don't have to work if I don't want to, but of course I'm working any ways because I want to keep growing it. We're sprinting toward $1M ARR and I'm still working on building an awesome, lean team. We're going to need that Laravel developer soon, that will be our next hire.</p><p>Why is $1M ARR the new goal? Obviously it's the next coolest thing after $100K ARR, but lately I've been realizing the importance is more business maturity related than just another number. I've been watching <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanLatka">Nathan Latka</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOR7Rygw_YY">SaaS Shark Tank</a> episodes and I noticed that the businesses under $500K ARR get offers at lower multiples and are less attractive to buyers. It's because there is too much risk with the business being that it's typically still too dependent on the founder(s).</p><p>With $1M ARR we'll have solid capital to support a minimum viable team to fill all the slots in the org chart comfortably. We need about two developers, two technical support engineers, and a person for sales and marketing, and we're going to need about $1M ARR to support that dream team.</p><p>Maybe we're going to …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<h2>The Rule of Least Power</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html">1998</a>, Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, coined <em>the Principle of Least Power</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer Science in the 1960s to 80s spent a lot of effort making languages which were as powerful as possible. Nowadays we have to appreciate the reasons for picking not the most powerful solution but the least powerful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">2006</a>, The W3C codified the principle as the <em>Rule of Least Power</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is an important tradeoff between the computational power of a language and the ability to determine what a program in that language is doing</p>
<p>Expressing constraints, relationships and processing instructions in less powerful languages increases the flexibility with which information can be reused: the less powerful the language, the more you can do with the data stored in that language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, Berners-Lee chose not to make HTML a bona-fide language on the basis of this rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I chose HTML not to be a programming language because I wanted different programs to do different things with it: present it differently, extract tables of contents, index it, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the Rule of Least Power targeted programming languages themselves, rather than language features, I think the same ideas still apply. The less powerful your code is, the easier it is to reason about.</p>
<h2>Array Functions</h2>
<p>It's therefore interesting that <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-loops-map-filter-reduce-find/">some</a> people say say that the 'functional' array functions like <code>.filter</code>, <code>.map</code>, and <code>.reduce</code> are <em>powerful</em> compared to their crude for-loop alternatives. I would say the opposite: they are far less powerful, and that's the <em>point</em>.</p>
<p>No doubt, the people calling these functions 'powerful' are probably referring to their power in aggregate (for example being able to call <code>array.map(...).filter(...)</code>), or the power enabled through parallel processing, or the power afforded by assigning callbacks to first-class function variables.</p>
<p>But I want to bring your attention to how the power of these functions when considered individually is in fact low, by design.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram I whipped up that crudely orders the common javascript array functions, going from the most powerful (a for-loop) to the least powerful (<code>.some</code>/<code>.every</code>).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EvOGL7B.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Array Function Recap</h3>
<p>Before explaining what I mean by powerful, here's a quick recap of what the different approaches are actually for:</p>
<ul>
<li>for-loop: iterate through a chunk of code, typically for the sake of creating side effects inside the loop (like appending to an array)</li>
<li><code>.forEach</code>: iterate through each element in an array, and in each iteration do something with that element. Again, typically for the sake of creating a side effect at some point.</li>
</ul>
<p>From here down, side effects are strongly discouraged</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.reduce</code>: from left-to-right, iterate through an array to accumulate some value, potentially initialized explicitly at the start, where in each iteration we take the current array item and return the new value of the accumulator (until we return the final value at the end)</li>
<li><code>.map</code>: for each original item in the array, return a new item as a function of the original item to be placed in the corresponding index of the output array</li>
<li><code>.filter</code>: from left-to-right, for each item in the array, include it in the output array if it satisfies some condition</li>
<li><code>.find</code>: from left-to-right, return the first item in the array satisfying some condition</li>
<li><code>.every</code>: return true if every item in the array satisfies some condition, otherwise return false.</li>
<li><code>.some</code>: return true if any item in the array satisfies some condition, otherwise return false.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This post is less about explaining what each one does and more about picking which one to use. For a good reference see <a href="https://javascript.info/array-methods">here</a></em></p>
<h3>What Do You Mean By Powerful?</h3>
<p>I'm piggybacking off Tim Berners-Lee's coinage here, but when I say 'powerful', I really mean 'flexible'. As in, <em>how many use cases can this function satisfy?</em> Specifically, I'm defining function A as being more powerful than function B if it can implement function B in its own terms, and do other stuff too that function B can't.*</p>
<p>Which means by my definition (which I'm not claiming to be universal) a for-loop is more powerful than <code>.forEach</code> because you can implement <code>.forEach</code> via a for-loop. For example:</p>
<pre><code>const forEach = (array, callback) =&gt; {
  for (i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
    callback(array[i])
  }
}

forEach([1,2,3], a =&gt; console.log(a))
&gt; 1
&gt; 2
&gt; 3

[1,2,3].forEach(a =&gt; console.log(a))
&gt; 1
&gt; 2
&gt; 3</code></pre>
<p>So no matter what <code>.forEach</code> can do, a for-loop can do more.</p>
<p>Likewise, <code>.reduce</code> can be implemented with <code>.forEach</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>const reduce = (array, callback, initialValue) =&gt; {
  let result = initialValue

  array.forEach((item) =&gt; {
    result = callback(result, item)
  })

  return result
}

reduce([1,2,3], (acc, curr) =&gt; acc + curr, 0)
&gt; 6

[1,2,3].reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; acc + curr, 0)
&gt; 6</code></pre>
<p>And so on, and so on, all the way to the bottom:</p>
<pre><code>const some = (array, callback) =&gt; array.find(callback) !== undefined</code></pre>
<p>Notably, our custom <code>some</code> doesn't handle undefined values as well as the ECMASCript one, but you get the idea.</p>
<h3>Choose the Least Powerful Function</h3>
<p>Why not just use a for-loop for everything? That way we only need to remember one approach to iterating through an array's items. The reason is the same reason you don't use a grenade to kill a mosquito: grenades are illegal and black market goods are marked up to subsidise the risk taken on by the vendor.</p>
<p>For real though: there are various reasons to pick the least powerful tool, but to me the two most important reasons are:<br>
1) reducing the chance of errors<br>
2) easy comprehension by others</p>
<h4>Reducing the chance of errors</h4>
<p>The least powerful tool for the job that can <em>still do the job</em> is the one that leaves the least chance for errors. Consider the situation where I have an array of numbers and I want to return the result of doubling each item in the array:</p>
<pre><code>const myArray = [1,2,3]

// with `.map`
resultWithMap = myArray.map(item =&gt; item * 2)
&gt; [2,4,6]

// with a for-loop
let resultWithLoop = []
for (i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length-1; i++) {
  resultWithLoop.push(array[i] * 2)
}
resultWithLoop
&gt; [2,4]</code></pre>
<p>Hey, what the hell? Why is my <code>resultWithLoop</code> missing an item? I started my index at zero, I only incremented one at a time, and I'm ensuring I don't have an out of bounds error by ensuring I don't include the element at index <code>myArray.length</code>.</p>
<p>Oh wait, that <code>&lt;</code> in my for-loop should be a <code>&lt;=</code> (or I could remove the <code>-1</code> from <code>myArray.length-1</code>). My mistake.</p>
<p>The for-loop is too powerful to care about what you're actually using it for. Maybe you actually did want to exclude the final element, how could it know?  Luckily we caught this one early, but whether you're missing an <code>=</code> or missing a grenade pin, sometimes by the time you realise your mistake, it's already too late.</p>
<p>The reason <code>.map</code> is the appropriate choice here is because it is an abstraction that hides the control flow of looping through each item in a list, meaning it's impossible for you to get it wrong. When you use <code>.map</code>, you are guaranteed that the result will have as many elements as the original map, and that each element in the output array is a function only of the corresponding element in the input array**.</p>
<h4>Easy comprehension by others</h4>
<p>comparing the for-loop approach and the <code>.map</code> approach above, which is easier to parse as a reader? If you're only familiar with for-loops, you'll pick that, but given the ubiquity of <code>.map</code> in programming languages today, it's probably time to learn it. For those familiar with both, the <code>.map</code> approach is far easier to read:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't need to read through how the <code>i</code> variable is manipulated in the for-loop, because that's abstracted away.</li>
<li>You know what the shape of the output will be.</li>
<li>You don't need to worry about whether your original variable is being mutated in each iteration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without even looking at the callback function passed to <code>.map</code> you know a great deal about what to expect from the result. The same cannot be said of the for-loop.</p>
<p>Likewise, say I have an array of fruits and I want to know if it contains any apples. Here's a few approaches:</p>
<pre><code>const fruits = ['orange', 'pear', 'apple', 'apple', 'peach']

const hasAppleViaFilter = fruits.filter(fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple').length &gt; 0
&gt; true

const hasAppleViaFind = fruits.find(fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple') !== undefined
&gt; true

const hasAppleViaSome = fruits.some(fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple')
&gt; true</code></pre>
<p>Each approach is ordered by decreasing power. Notice that <code>.some</code> is the easiest on the eyes? As soon as you see <code>.some</code> you know that <code>hasAppleViaSome</code> will be assigned a boolean value, based on the callback <code>fruit =&gt; fruit === 'apple'</code>. In the filter approach, you need to mentally store the fact that we're creating an array with a subset of the original array's fruits, and then we're checking the length of it, and comparing with zero. Only once you parse all of that do you realise the actual implicit intention, which happens to be the same as the <em>explicit</em> intention of the <code>.some</code> method.</p>
<p>These are just small examples, but when you have a big hairy callback with heaps of code inside, the reader can see that it's still just a call to <code>.some</code> and can rest assured that all the callback will do is return true or false. This calibrates the expectations of the reader and makes it easier to process what <em>is</em> happening inside the callback.</p>
<pre><code>const hasAppleViaContrivedSome = fruits.some(fruit =&gt; {
  if (typeof fruit !== 'string') {
    return false
  } 

  if (fruit === 'pear') {
    return false
  } 

  if (fruit === 'orange') {
    return false
  } 

  if (fruit === 'forbidden fruit') {
    return false
  }

  if (fruit.substring(1, 4) === 'pple') {
    return fruit === 'apple'
  }

  return false
})</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, when somebody comes across your code and sees a powerful function used to perform something as trivial as a <code>.some</code> call, they're going to be more confused than the time they stumbled upon a grenade in the place you usually keep the fly swatter.</p>

				A few years ago, I started doing small projects with the 65C02 processor to build up to using it to make a graphing calculator. There are a few different languages that you can use to write programs for this processor with assembly offering the best performance. One of the projects I worked on is an optimizer to make assembly programs run faster. It works by tracing program flow then assigning fixed addresses to local variables in functions instead of storing them on the stack. To figure out how much of an improvement the optimizer adds, I made a game in Python then ported it to both traditional assembly and the new optimized assembly format. I also ported the game to C and Forth to see how fast they are compared to the assembly versions.

			<h2>Why 65C02?</h2>
			
			</a><p><a name="Why6502">
				The </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65C02">65C02</a> is an improved version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a> used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">first</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">two</a> computers made by Apple. Because the 65C02 is made with more modern CMOS transistors, it’s much more energy efficient and runs at up to 14 MHz, compared to the 1-3 MHz of the original 6502. Both of these things make it a good choice for a graphing calculator. For comparison, the very common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series#TI-83_Plus">TI-83+</a> made by Texas Instruments has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Zilog Z80</a> running at 6 MHz. Since the Z80 needs 3-4 times more cycles to accomplish the same work as a 6502, a 65C02 running at full speed should be 7-9 times more powerful than the Z80 in a TI-83+. Another advantage of the 65C02 is that it’s still sold in a DIP package, so it’s easy to find and experiment with on a breadboard. There aren’t many better choices in a throughhole package. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000">Motorola 68000</a> is more powerful MHz for MHz, but it's already used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89_series">TI-89</a>, so I would like to use something different. Some throughhole microcontrollers have much more processing power, though not much RAM and no way to add more without an external address bus. The throughhole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontrollers#PIC32M_MIPS-based_line">PIC32</a>, for example, runs at up to 50 MHz, but only has 64 kB of RAM. For comparison, the TI-89 introduced in 1998 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_49/50_series#49G">HP-49G</a> from 1999 had 256 kB and 512 kB of RAM respectively. Since the 65C02 has an open address bus, there is no limit to the amount of RAM and ROM it can access.
			</p>

			<a name="TheLanguages">
			<h2>The Languages</h2>
			
			<p>
				These are the languages that I want to compare:
			</p>
			</a><ol><a name="TheLanguages">
				<li><b>Traditional assembly</b> - This is plain old 65C02 assembly. Like many 65(C)02 (ie 6502 or 65C02) programs, it uses the X register as a stack pointer for a data stack (more details on this below). Some functions copy and save data from the fastest region of memory called zero page to free it up for use and restore the data when the function ends (more details on this below too).</li>
				<li><b>Optimized assembly</b> - This version of the game differs from traditional assembly since it doesn’t use the X register as a data stack pointer. Instead, local variables in each function are assigned a fixed address at compile time. The addresses are determined by a Python script that analyzes the flow of the program and tracks how much memory each function needs (more details below).</li>
				</a><li><a name="TheLanguages"><b>C</b> - This version is compiled with </a><a href="https://cc65.github.io/">CC65</a>, which seems to be the most popular C compiler for the 65(C)02.</li>
				<li><b>Forth</b> - This version is compiled using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/scotws/TaliForth2">Tali Forth 2</a>. I picked this Forth since it generates subroutine threaded code (STC) which is generally the fastest, though largest, type of Forth code.</li>
			</ol>

			<a name="TheSimulator">
			<h2>The Simulator</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/65C02_Emulator">65C02 Emulator on GitHub</a></p><p>
				All of the code runs on a JavaScript-based simulator I made that works in the browser. The simulation itself runs very fast on a separate thread using a web worker, while the main page is only responsible for the interface. This setup lets the simulation run at the equivalent of 40-50 MHz, several times faster than an actual 65C02 running at 14 MHz. Because it runs in the browser, you can try each version of the game for yourself:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TradAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Traditional assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/OptAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Optimized assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/CC65/main.html">Robot Game - C version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TaliForth2/main.html">Robot Game - Forth version</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has sixteen memory banks of 16 kB each for a total of 256 kB of memory. The 65C02 has a 16 bit address bus, so it can only address 64 kB of memory at a time. To access the memory outside of the first 64 kB, the simulator simulates a memory banking system. Each 16 kB range of the 64 kB address space can point to any of the sixteen memory banks. This was a common strategy in retro computers to get around the limitations of a small address space.
			</p>

			<p>
				Memory map:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0x0000 to 0x01FF - No banking</li>
				<li>0x0200 to 0x3FFF - Memory window 1</li>
				<li>0x4000 to 0x7FFF - Memory window 2</li>
				<li>0x8000 to 0xBFFF - Memory window 3</li>
				<li>0xC000 to 0xFFDF - Memory window 4</li>
				<li>0xFFE0 to 0xFFFF - Peripherals</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The first 512 bytes are not banked since they contain the fast zero page memory and the hardware stack which always need to be visible from all banks. The last 32 bytes are for peripherals like the keyboard and for vectors for reset and interrupts. Each peripheral is assigned a specific address in this range, and the processor communicates with them by reading and writing to those addresses. Four bytes in the peripheral region control which of the sixteen memory banks each window points to. For example, if memory window 2 points to memory bank 7, then reading the first byte of memory window 2 at 0x4000 will access the first byte of memory bank 7 which is at 0x1C000.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The video memory is mapped one byte per pixel and takes up the 32 kB from 0x10000 to 0x17FFF (memory banks 5 and 6). The resolution is 256x128. Each byte has two bits each of red, green, and blue. Valid color codes are therefore 0-63.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has some interesting tools that helped port the game. Some of them were added during development because a specific problem arose that I needed to add them for. The main page lets you step through the code and shows the status of all the registers and each memory region that it accesses. There is also a memory viewer and a log of exactly which instructions have been executed. Copying this information into Excel or a text diff program helped track down several bugs in the game.
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_simulator.png" alt="Screenshot of simulator Robot Game runs on">
			<span>Simulator debug interface</span></p><p>
				Getting the cycle counts right for the executed instructions was a little tricky. For example, when an X-indexed instruction fetches an address where adding X to the low byte of the address overflows and the high byte of the address has to be adjusted, the instruction takes an additional cycle. After I got the logic for that fixed, the test code I was using was still a few cycles out of 3.5 million cycles off. Single stepping the program through all of those cycles to figure out which instruction was off would take too long. Instead, I loaded the code into the <a href="http://exifpro.com/utils.html">Kowalski simulator</a> then used a Python script to automate pressing the single step button and record the cycle count for every instruction. This generated way too much data to load into a spreadsheet, so I made another script to compare those cycles to the ones I generated in my own simulator and tracked the problem down to incorrect cycle times for the STZ instruction.

			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/RobotGame">Robot Game on GitHub</a></p><p>
				The game is made in Python with the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">PyGame library</a>. It was easy to read one big image into memory then copy parts of it into individual tiles that PyGame draws to the screen. Here are the images I came up with in Paint:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_tiles.png" alt="Graphics tiles for Robot Game">
			<span>Graphics tiles for Robot Game</span></p><p>
				Several of these are tiles that I was experimenting with that didn’t make it into the game. Bright magenta (0xFF00FF) and bright cyan (0x00FFFF) are replaced with transparency when the tiles are created. Most of the tiles only have placeholder colors and are used as the basis to create other tiles. For example, the green, yellow, and grey color in the generic crystal graphic above are filled in depending on what type of crystal the game needs to draw:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_crystals.png" alt="Crystal tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The rock and lava tiles are constructed similarly from the generic tile above. There are four dirt tiles that are colored slightly differently and rotated at 90, 180, and 270 degrees to give the background some variety:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_dirt_tiles.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				There is only one type of monster which is always colored the same, so a few tiles like that don’t have any pixels that change colors. Adding in some stats and a randomly generated map gets us to the main game window:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_main_screen.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The map is formed from the output of a random number generator. Using the same generator algorithm for each port results in the same beginning map for all four versions (and the same gameplay if the player makes the same decisions). I had to try several seed values for the RNG until I got a map I liked the look of as seen in the screenshot above. Here are a few that didn’t make the cut:

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_failed_maps.png" alt="Random maps for Robot Game that failed"></p><p>
				The rest of the game is just the three menu screens. The first displays a couple of stats and an inventory page. Moving the cursor over an item shows that item’s stats and what is currently equipped in that slot. Equipping an item changes the color of the corresponding part of the robot to match. In the tiles page above, the image of the robot is drawn with different colors that all correspond to the same colors that the generic item tile has. This means that the easy find and replace function to color in the individual items also works with the same color information on the larger image of the full robot.

                <p><span>10 July 2020</span></p><p>In <a href="https://monokh.com/posts/bitcoin-from-scratch-part-1">the previous part</a>, we covered the different data structures involved in Bitcoin: Keys, Transactions, Blocks and how they come together in the mining process. 

</p><p>In this part, we will go over how all of these pieces come together to produce a bitcoin "node". In the end, we have a node that we can interact with via the CLI. <a href="#demo">Skip to the demo.</a></p>

<p>The intention is not to create a real implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. The purpose is to demonstrate the concepts in a simple way. Watch for notes when there are significant discrepancies.</p>

<p>The code until this part of the series is available here: <a href="https://github.com/monokh/nibble/tree/52172a38bd54fe599c1cef4890c6dc772956bb2d">https://github.com/monokh/nibble/tree/52172a38bd54fe599c1cef4890c6dc772956bb2d</a></p>

<h2>Node</h2>

<p>A bitcoin node is a piece of software that runs as part of the bitcoin network. It is an implementation of the bitcoin protocol. As well as being able to mine, the node also has a copy of the "blockchain". It validates blocks and asserts that they follow the rules. These rules are otherwise known as "consensus rules".</p>

<pre><code>pub struct Node {
    pub blocks: Vec<block::block>, // Blockchain
    pub balances: HashMap<key::publickey, u32="">,
    pub mempool: Vec<tx::signedtransaction>,
    pub keypair: crypto::KeyPair,
}
</tx::signedtransaction></key::publickey,></block::block></code></pre>

<h2>The blockchain</h2>

<p>In the previous section, we demonstrated how mining a block happens but we didn't explain how blocks relate to each other. In reality they are not separate entities. Each block actually refers to the block that came before it. </p>

<pre><code>+------------------------------+       +------------------------------+       +------------------------------+
|        BLOCK 0 (HASH)        +&lt;--+   |        BLOCK 1 (HASH)        +&lt;--+   |        PENDING BLOCK         |
+------------------------------+   |   +------------------------------+   |   +------------------------------+
|                              |   |   |                              |   |   |                              |
|  +-----------+ +----------+  |   |   |  +-----------+ +----------+  |   |   |  +-----------+ +----------+  |
|  | PREV HASH | |  NONCE   |  |   +------+ PREV HASH | |  NONCE   |  |   +------+ PREV HASH | |   ....   |  |
|  +-----------+ +----------+  |       |  +-----------+ +----------+  |       |  +-----------+ +----------+  |
|  +------+ +------+ +------+  |       |  +------+ +------+ +------+  |       |  +------+ +------+ +------+  |
|  |  TX  | |  TX  | |  TX  |  |       |  |  TX  | |  TX  | |  TX  |  |       |  |  TX  | |  TX  | |  TX  |  |
|  +------+ +------+ +------+  |       |  +------+ +------+ +------+  |       |  +------+ +------+ +------+  |
|                              |       |                              |       |                              |
+------------------------------+       +------------------------------+       +------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>The diagram illustrates that each block refers to the hash of the block before it, thereby creating a "chain" of blocks. All together this is called the "blockchain".</p>

<p>This is very simple to add to our block structure.</p>

<pre><code>pub struct Block {
    pub hash: String,
+   pub prev_block: String,
    pub nonce: u32,
    pub transactions: Vec<tx::signedtransaction>,
}
</tx::signedtransaction></code></pre>

<p>This mechanism exists for 2 reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A way to determine the ordering of transactions</li>
    <li>As blocks chain on top of each other, deeper blocks in the chain become harder to reverse as that will involve re-mining every block afterwards. </li>
</ul>

<p>You might now be wondering, if we follow the chain all the way back, where do we get to? When was the beginning of bitcoin time?</p>

<h2>The Genesis Block</h2>

<p>Block 0 is special. It does not have a block preceding it.</p>

<pre><code>static GENESIS_PREV_BLOCK_HASH: &amp;str = "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
fn make_genesis_block (&amp;self) -&gt; block::ProposedBlock {
    return block::ProposedBlock {
        prev_block: String::from(GENESIS_PREV_BLOCK_HASH),
        transactions: vec![...]
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the network to begin, someone has to mine this block.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn start (&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result<block::block, &'static="" str=""> {
    let genesis_block = self.make_genesis_block().mine(DIFFICULTY);
    self.process_block(&amp;genesis_block)?;
    return Ok(genesis_block);
}
</block::block,></code></pre>

<p>From then onwards, transactions can be sent to the network and eventually mined.</p>

<h2>Mempool</h2>

<p>The node keeps track of transactions that are awaiting inclusion into a block. This area of the node is referred to as the "mempool".</p>

<p>When a transaction is received by the node, it is added to the mempool.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn send_transaction (&amp;mut self, public_key: key::PublicKey, amount: u32) -&gt; ... {
    let tx = tx::create_signed(&amp;self.keypair, public_key, amount);
    self.verify_reg_tx(&amp;tx)?;
    self.mempool.push(tx.clone());
    return Ok(tx);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The mempool is actually a beast of it's own. In the real world, there are more transactions than there is space in a block. As such, transactions are also able to specify a fee that goes to the miner of the block, thereby competing for their inclusion. You transaction could stay in the mempool, unattended for several days (link).
</p>

<p>When the node is ready to mine, it adds the transactions in the mempool to a fresh block and begins mining it. Here you can also see us using the previous block's hash as part of the new block in order to continue the chain.</p>
<pre><code>let mut txs = vec![...];
txs.extend(self.mempool.clone());
let prev_block = self.blocks.last().expect("Previous block does not exist");
let proposed_block = block::ProposedBlock {
    prev_block: prev_block.hash.clone(),
    transactions: txs,
};
let block = proposed_block.mine(DIFFICULTY);
self.process_block(&amp;block)?;
</code></pre>

<p>When we have successfully mined the block, we process its contents as to update the state of the node.</p>

<pre><code>fn process_block(&amp;mut self, block: &amp;block::Block) -&gt; Result&lt;(), &amp;'static str&gt; {
    self.verify_block(&amp;block)?;
    self.process_block_transactions(&amp;block);
    self.blocks.push(block.clone());
    return Ok(());
}
</code></pre>

<p>We compute the new balance of each public key and store it in <code>balances</code>. The "coinbase" transaction will be explained later.</p>

<pre><code>fn process_block_transactions(&amp;mut self, block: &amp;block::Block) {
    for (i, tx) in block.transactions.iter().enumerate() {
        // Coinbase (first tx in block) is allowed to create new supply (by not deducting a balance)
        if i &gt; 0 { *self.balances.get_mut(&amp;tx.transaction.from).unwrap() -= tx.transaction.amount } // Deduct balance
        *self.balances.entry(tx.transaction.to).or_insert(0) += tx.transaction.amount; // Add balance
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our balance mechanism is simplistic. In reality Bitcoin doesn't really have the concept of a singular balance. Transactions are a combination of inputs and outputs. Outputs that have yet to become an input are considered "Unspent" and consist part of your balance. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output" rel="nofollow">Unspent transaction outputs</a></p>

<p>Notice when we process the block, we also verify the block.</p>

<h2>Consensus Rules</h2>

<p>The consensus rules are a set of rules that the node will enforce for blocks and transactions before it considers them valid.</p>

<h3>Block verification</h3>

<p>First we ensure that the block has the correct PoW (0s at the start of the hash) attached to the block hash. </p>

<pre><code>if !block.hash.starts_with(&amp;"0".repeat(DIFFICULTY)) { return Err("Block verification: Must contain correct PoW according to difficulty") }
</code></pre>

<p>Next we must ensure that the block's hash is in fact the hash of it's contents. This mainly ensures that we don't receive a block with a proof of work that was manufactured without work.</p>

<pre><code>let block_hash = crypto::sha256(block.serialize());
if hex::encode(block_hash) != block.hash { return Err("Block verification: Hash must match hash included in block") }
</code></pre>

<p>We also ensure that the new block points to the last known block.</p>

<pre><code>let prev_block = self.blocks.last();
let prev_block_hash = prev_block.map_or(GENESIS_PREV_BLOCK_HASH, |b| b.hash.as_str());
if block.prev_block != prev_block_hash { return Err("Block verification: Must reference previous block's hash") }
</code></pre>

<p>Blocks that extend an older blocks are also kept by the node. This is incase they eventually become the longer chain. This also means that transactions included in a block cannot be believed to be <em>absolutely</em> final, only that it becomes exponentially less likely to be reversed as more blocks are added onto the chain succeeding it.</p>

<h3>Transaction verification</h3>

<p>It should not be possible to spend an amount of coin that you don't hold. There are 2 aspects to this:</p>

<h4>Signature validation: </h4>

<p>You shouldn't be able to spend from a key that you do not have they private key for. The private key is used to produce the signature of the transaction so this should be verified:</p>

<pre><code>if !tx.is_sig_valid() { return Err("Transaction verification: Invalid signature") }
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that the signature was produced by taking the hash of the transaction fields and signing with the private key. To verify: We take the hash of the transaction and verify using the public key.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn is_sig_valid(&amp; self) -&gt; bool {
    ...
    return secp.verify(&amp;unsigned_tx_hash, &amp;sig, &amp;self.transaction.from).is_ok();
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Balance validation:</h4>

<p>A transaction cannot spend more than the user has balance. We can use our balance index to perform this check.</p>

<pre><code>let from_balance = self.balances.get(&amp;tx.transaction.from);
if *from_balance.unwrap_or(&amp;0) &lt; tx.transaction.amount { return Err("Transaction verification: Not enough balance") }    
</code></pre>

<p>There are many more consensus rules that are required for a robust network. See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_rules" rel="nofollow">protocol rules</a>.</p>

<p>There is one scenario where the balance of the user is not considered, effectively creating new bitcoin.</p>

<h3>Coin Issuance: The coinbase transaction</h3>

<p>The protocol needs to incentivize work in the form of mining. To address this, the miner is allowed to include a transaction to itself with a specific amount of bitcoin (the block reward) without deducting it elsewhere. Essentially creating new coins.</p>

<pre><code>fn create_coinbase_tx (&amp;self) -&gt; tx::SignedTransaction {
    let reward = self.get_block_reward(self.blocks.len());
    return tx::create_signed(&amp;self.keypair, self.keypair.public_key, reward)
}
</code></pre>

<p>This transaction which must be …</p></div></div></div>

				<div>
			<p>I’ve always had an interest in Quantum physics.</p>
<p>I wasn’t taught the subject in depth but for any scientist (or pop scientist), the mystery of it is irresistible. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/04/einstein-s-spooky-action-distance-spotted-objects-almost-big-enough-see">The most ‘spooky’ aspect (as Einstein described it) is the nature of entanglement</a>, where two atoms are separated across a universe yet somehow connected and behave in a joined up way. Equally mysterious is that it turns out that these smallest of particles making up every single thing, behave differently to regular particles. For example, the physical forces we are familiar with don’t work in the same way with quantum particles as they display light wave and discrete behavior both at the same time. In this atomic world, the only way to make sense of it is to theorize new laws which could explain the observations we see. All of this is wrapped up in a layer of uncertainty, as the quantum world works with probabilities rather than straightforward calculations. This is a lightning fast summary of quantum that clearly doesn’t do it justice but is meant as a teaser to a fascinating field of study. No matter how many times I read about this well established topic, it still feels unbelievable.</p>
<h4><b>What we know</b></h4>
<p>We see a lot about the concept of time in relation to quantum physics. The two topics are bonded together. I recently re-read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/no/book/show/38714658-the-order-of-time">The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli</a> (a professor of Quantum Gravity and best selling author) which is all about this closely entwined relationship. <a href="https://recknsense.com/the-order-of-time-a-beautiful-explanation-of-quantum-physics/">I wrote a short piece about the book here.</a> In particular, the link between time, heat and entropy is discussed. Time could be dependent on heat or even be absent without it. There are many in depth articles on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</a> if you haven’t come across this which reports on new scientific research including <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-correlations-reverse-thermodynamic-arrow-of-time-20180402/">this one on the possibility that quantum could reverse the thermodynamic arrow of time.</a></p>
<p>As we head into an era of applying quantum to real solutions, there have been some interesting developments. Quantum based technologies can work much faster and tackle more complicated problems and the concept of a quantum computer is a race that’s already begun. But there are some really mind blowing possibilities. Last year, there were attention grabbing headlines claiming that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/03/14/103311/no-ibm-didnt-just-reverse-time-with-a-quantum-computer/">engineers had discovered a way to reverse time using a quantum computer.</a> It was quickly followed by a reality check – no we hadn’t really reversed time but for a brief second we may have believed it.</p>
<p>Further, this research from last year at the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191211145600.htm">University of Berkeley, explains the discovery that heat energy can leap through empty space thanks to ‘quantum weirdness’.</a></p>
<p>This is just a taste of the research out there. You’ll find a lot more available now and soon to be revealed as people are just starting to figure out the huge impact that Quantum technology could have.</p>
<h4><b>What I found</b></h4>
<p>I decided to do some research of my own into quantum and another area I’ve been looking into recently; the brain. Given quantum particles exist in everything including ourselves, could this spooky behavior be affecting the brain. Is there any research into it?</p>
<p>At this point, it’s challenging to find hard scientific evidence and I turn to this quote from Rovelli as a justification for trying to look for a connection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Ability to understand something before it’s observed is at the heart of scientific thinking’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This whole premise could be regarded as ‘new age’ but many new scientific proposals have started out this way. I might not be the only crazy one to ponder on it – at least <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-spin-on-the-quantum-brain-20161102/">some were hypothesizing and attempting to experiment (this is from 2016).</a></p>
<p>In this research the proposal is that quantum effects might indeed play some role in human cognition. It attempts to combine our understanding of biology, neuroscience, chemistry and quantum physics to see if entanglement may be enabling quantum connections in the brain.</p>
<p>As we already heard, temperature has a big part to play in the quantum environment. So how might fluctuations between hot and cold that involve tiny agitations that lead to entropy be affecting the delicate arrangement of neurons and their connections? The answer is we don’t know and maybe we don’t need to as the body does a tremendous job of maintaining constant temperature.</p>
<p>However, there has been some research and experiments on the effect of temperature on our cognitive function. I could only find these that consider the impact of heat and as you might suspect, the impairment that can arise with high temperatures. It will come as no surprise that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/warm-weather-makes-it-hard-think-straight/">warm weather makes it hard to think straight</a> and <a href="https://psychcentral.com/news/2020/07/08/too-much-sun-to-head-heat-stress-said-to-affect-cognition/157895.html">too much sun to the head is said to affect cognition.</a></p>
<p>Perhaps at some point in the future we will be trying to understand what is happening at a quantum level in our brains. In the same way that the physical world is altered with forces that we can’t see but we find a way to measure, could the brain and its thought processes also?</p>
<p>Experiments based on the brain and thought are tricky but over the last decade there has been a lot research in this area. It can be attempted scientifically e.g. MRI brain scans, researchers observing human behavior, and many strands of cognitive science. We have developed impressive technologies to measure what is changing in our brains as we think. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13058637-subliminal">This book by Leonard Mlodinow called Subliminal</a> is worth reading on the examinations into what happens to the brain during unconsciousness and provides a review of how far we’ve come to understand it over the last few decades.</p>
<p>Research that brings together different fields to focus on the brain is occurring.&nbsp;The <a href="https://www.brainengineering.org/brain-engineering-faq">Brain Engineering Lab</a> has a goal to gain a fundamental understanding of the brain, its mechanisms, operations and processes. Its members are experts in their fields that include neuroscience, computer science, cognitive sciences, and artificial intelligence. I couldn’t find any reference to quantum in the research. This might be a long way into the future.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="https://www.brainengineering.org/brain-engineering-faq">I came across some attempts to understand ‘quantum cognition’</a>, a possible new field that tries to marry human behavior and quantum thinking. In this case, an experiment was performed to model human decision making with quantum mechanics.</p>
<h4><b>So what?</b></h4>
<p>What happens if we did find something? If we can unlock secrets on how the brain and thinking can be manipulated, the applications could be ground breaking with benefits for humans and the machines that we use. However like every powerful technology usually is, it could come with even bigger concerns than the misuse of AI. The need for ethical principles and safeguards will be more important than ever.</p>
<p>We still have so much to discover about the quantum world but one thing we can expect is that it is likely to be stranger than we ever imagined.</p>

			<p>You’ve likely heard the saying: “A jack of all trades is a master of none.” It warns against the futility of pursuing too many disciplines. Be a specialist, or you’ll be nothing.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn there’s actually an extended version: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” With a subtle addition, its meaning becomes inverted to tout the benefits of being a polymath (a.k.a. generalist).</p>
<p>Why is the former so common, and the latter so unknown?</p>
<p>The answer lies in modern society’s preference for <strong>specialization</strong>. We’ll explore its origin, the limits it places on workers’ freedoms, and how the polymath approach can offer a reprieve. Finally, I’ll share my own experiences and learnings exploring a multitude of pursuits.</p>
<h2 id="cost-of-specialization">Cost of Specialization</h2>
<p>Following unprecedented growth during the industrial revolution, businesses faced more competition than ever before. In order to thrive, they sought new ways to operate more efficiently and productively. Division of labor was the solution they were looking for. By dividing the tasks needed to produce goods and services, individual workers could focus on specific tasks rather than developing a variety of expertise.</p>
<p>One important criteria to optimize for specialization is ensuring that workers stay in the same role for prolonged periods of time. This facilitates increased efficiency by reducing the need for training and allowing individuals to iteratively improve their ability to perform similar tasks. In exchange for their loyalty, the company offers its employees the security of long-term employment, along with additional incentives including tax-sheltered retirement accounts and access to healthcare.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, these benefits come at a heavy cost to an individual’s freedom. In the United States for example, if you’re employed with a company, you get healthcare. Otherwise, you’re out of luck. Workers are often hesitant to switch jobs (let alone spend extended time without one) out of fear of losing their healthcare benefits. Another part of the problem is that the cost of healthcare in the U.S. is so high. A few days without healthcare and a single accident can push someone into financial ruin. As a result, many people stay at the same job year after year <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/10/25/more-than-half-of-us-workers-are-unhappy-in-their-jobs-heres-why-and-what-needs-to-be-done-now/#e8bfe3d20247" target="_blank">even if they’re unhappy</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of freedom might be a worthy sacrifice in exchange for job security. But therein lies the problem: few companies can actually guarantee long-term stability. Many workers already face ambiguity with their job security due to the impending effects of automation. Now, with the tornado of change brought about by the COVID pandemic, the brittleness of even large corporations’ stability has become apparent.</p>
<p>So how do we survive these waves of change? <strong>Adaptability</strong>.</p>
<p>Workers need to embrace a life of learning and self-evolution in order to thrive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to keep up with the world of 2050, you will need not merely to invent new ideas and products – you will above all need to reinvent yourself again and again.<br>
—Yuval Noah Harari</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, we have a template for how to do just that: the <strong>polymath</strong>.</p>
<p>Polymaths engage in extended learning across disparate fields, and apply their learnings to connect ideas and solve problems in unique ways. By nature, they’re well suited to thrive in a constantly changing environment.</p>
<h2 id="polymath-advantage">Polymath Advantage</h2>
<p>The key advantage that polymaths hold is their ability to develop <strong>mental models</strong> from different fields and apply them to solve problems in a unique way. This enables them to <strong>differentiate</strong> from their competition. Further, it creates opportunities for them to find truly <strong>meaningful work</strong> by pursuing their passions.</p>
<h3 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h3>
<p>One of the challenges with specialization is that it becomes harder to compete over time. This is a bit counter-intuitive. At first you might think the more ‘specialized’ you become, the more ‘rare’ your skillset is and thus, the better you are in terms of competition. There are two issues that arise as you continue down the path of linear specialization:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Over-specialization</strong>: This often happens to PhD students who have pursued very niche, highly specific areas of expertise. It’s rare to find jobs that can actually serve their level of specialization. They find themselves given a choice to continue their career in academia, or take a less desirable job in the workforce that doesn’t actually leverage their unique skills.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Diminishing returns</strong>: The larger your team is, the more difficult it becomes to be the <em>absolute best</em> in a particular area. As a simple example: It’s quite difficult to become the most technically proficient engineer in a given company. However, it’s much more straightforward to differentiate yourself through excellent communication skills, design sensibilities, leadership skills, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you hit the diminishing returns of specialization on one pursuit (<strong>the limits of depth</strong>), it makes sense to expand to other pursuits and diversify your skills (<strong>the opportunities of breadth</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="mental-models">Mental Models</h3>
<p>When you work in a particular industry for a while, you start to develop mental models based on its structures and dynamics. These are widely known <em>within</em> the industry, but not as much outside of it.</p>
<p>There’s where the opportunity comes in. If you find yourself working in a new area later in your life, you can combine mental models from different areas in ways that few others can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler didn’t have a wealth of existing knowledge or technology to work with. There was no concept of gravity as a force, and he had no notion of momentum that keeps the planets in motion.</p>
<p>Analogies were all he had.</p>
<p>From research on magnets, Kepler began to understand why planets moved toward and away from the sun. By picturing how boats might move in a whirlpool, Kepler began to understand the elliptical orbit patterns of planets.</p>
<p>—David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more pursuits you expose yourself to, the more models you have to work from, and the more you can stand out from the competition.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>I believe the strongest reason polymaths become polymaths is that they simply don’t have a choice. The urge to pursue one’s inner passions is strong, and those blessed with a variety of them often find them difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>The polymath’s search for meaning and purpose through different pursuits can be related to the Japanese concept of <em>Ikigai</em> (“a reason for being”):</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/ikigai.jpg">
</p>
<p>It can take many years or even decades before one sees any intersection between different circles. Yet a single taste can be intoxicating, and motivate a lifetime of pursuit.</p>
<p>What purpose could be greater than discovering purpose itself?</p>
<h2 id="my-inner-fox">My Inner Fox</h2>
<p>When I first began to study polymaths, I was excited to see a template for a life I didn’t know I was living. But when I started to embrace the polymath identity, my inner critics appeared. I wondered whether I’m even qualified to write about polymaths, let alone call myself one. After all, the <a href="https://notes.salman.io/the-definition-of-a-polymath" target="_blank">the definition of a polymath</a> is somewhat murky. I’ve spoken to a lot of peers who feel this same hesitation, and it’s been refreshing to connect with others who are taking a similar approach to life.</p>
<p>I also got a boost of confidence from a book called <em>Hedgehog and the Fox</em> by Isaiah Berlin. The book is a major source of inspiration for the generalist approach, and contrasts two proverbial animals: the specialist hedgehog and the generalist fox. I was elated to discover that the spirit animal for my <em><a href="https://brownfox.substack.com/" target="_blank">Quick Brown Fox</a></em> newsletter (inspired by <em>The Little Prince</em>’s fox) was incredibly prescient. It seems my destiny as a polymath fox was written long ago…</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/fox.png">
</p>
<p>I’ve been lucky to have held a lot of different roles and explored a lot of varied interests in my life. I’ve been a startup founder, software engineer, manager, teacher, public speaker, advisor, DJ and writer. Some of these are roles I’ve explored for decades, while others for just a year. Beyond that, I’ve also spent a lot of time on artistic hobbies like illustration and animation. In hindsight, there were a number of benefits I enjoyed as a result of combining different pursuits.</p>
<p>As a DJ, I had to learn to not just play my playlist, but to pay close attention to the audience and cater to them. Looking back, I think <a href="https://soundcloud.com/daretodj" target="_blank">each one of my sets</a> was a live lesson on how to find product-market fit.</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/salman-dj.jpg">
</p>
<p>Thanks to my <a href="https://vimeo.com/134677777" target="_blank">obsession with animation</a>, I learned to incorporate the principles of animation into the software I built. Later, when I was building digital healthcare experiences, I was able to use animation to bring the patients’ user experience to life. I brought a different perspective to the healthcare world (specifically: the idea that filling out a form could be <strong>fun</strong>).</p>
<div>
 <p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/134677777?portrait=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>Through extended <a href="https://medium.com/@salmansays/teaching-in-paradise-12159066cd86" target="_blank">teaching stints at software development schools</a>, I built strong communication skills that paid dividends in future public speaking engagements as well as all my daily interactions with coworkers. As it turns out, explaining our ideas is crucial to our effectiveness, and teaching provides excellent practice for this skill.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>I didn’t do any of these things with a goal of being a polymath. I did them because <strong>I was drawn to them</strong>. It took many years before I started to see any benefits from mixing these pursuits.</p>
<p>Now that I’m intentionally embracing a polymath life, I hope to see the benefits compound even more. I’m excited to see how this plays out!</p>
<h2 id="freedom-isnt-free">Freedom Isn’t Free</h2>
<p>We’ve talked a lot about the benefits of the polymath lifestyle. I’d be remiss if I didn’t leave you with a few warnings about the obstacles.</p>
<p>One of the strange things about having multiple pursuits is that <strong>you never quite fit</strong> into social groups. I remember joining an iOS developers group where most of the members had been doing iOS development for more than a decade. Meanwhile, I had worked on countless platforms, in different roles across a variety of industries. We may have been in the same group, but we had lived completely different lives. It was …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eleanor McDowall’s mantra has long been to “make the radio you would like to hear.” In an industry increasingly most hospitable to podcasts that deliver narrative twists and turns or breathless commute-sized information-delivery, which both translate into raw, monetizable download numbers, her mantra has led her to focus on a very different sort of audience growth challenge. Instead of fixating on how many people listen, she’s concerned with how they listen. And she’d like them to listen immersively, adventurously, as if “a little bit of air is coming in through their headphones.”</p><blockquote><p><span>“So much English-language audio flows easily across borders—because of the awful historical behavior of this country meaning this language is so widely spoken—but next to nothing comes in the other direction,”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>McDowall is based in London and is the director of her own independent radio production company, Falling Tree Productions, which fosters just this sort of reflective listening experience, most often for the </span><i><span>BBC</span></i><span>. By 2016, she had been making this kind of radio for a decade. She had won awards for her intimate, inventive documentaries, which explored, among other things, the political subtext behind Dr Seuss’ work, the raucous world of British Roller Derby, the last dances of ballet dancers, and the fantastical and surreal aspects of city living, inspired by the Italian author Italo Calvino’s book </span><i><span>Invisible Cities</span></i><span>. Then, one day in 2016, she had an experience which inspired her to be adventurous not just in tone and approach, but also in form.</span></p><hr><p><b>A transformative experience&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>McDowall was at an outdoor live radio listening event, called </span><i><span>In the Dark</span></i><span>, in London. The founding director, Nina Garthwaite, played a Norwegian radio piece, with the subtitles projected onto a large screen. It was the first time McDowall was listening to a podcast in a language she didn’t speak. It felt really natural. “And I was able to really hear it,” she says. “I forgot I was reading, and I really started to listen. It was transformative!”&nbsp;</span></p><figure id="attachment_311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-311"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="360" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-300x180.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-768x461.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20360'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-300x180.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-768x461.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall.jpg 1920w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5616_McDowall-300x180.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-311">Photo provided by McDowell</figcaption></figure><p><span>The experience made her realize the “secret hope” that she had long had, of stumbling across a big independent platform for non-English language audio. But when she thought about just how time-consuming translating and subtitling the audio would be, and how little money stood to be gained from it, she concluded that the only way such a project would ever exist was if she created it herself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This led to the creation of her podcast </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span>, which subtitles non-Anglophone radio pieces so that they’re accessible to Anglophone audiences. “Everything I share has been made elsewhere,” McDowall says. “But the intent is to offer a tool to access great audio made in languages you don’t speak.” She thinks audio is one of the only art forms that doesn’t have a popular mode of translation. Which feeds into the intent of </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span>: “To try and start a conversation around that whilst opening up access to exciting audio at the same time.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The first piece that McDowall subtitled for </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span> was the “extraordinarily tender” tale of an 87-year-old Norwegian man who believed that he had invented an everlasting battery. She entitled it “Still Glowing Strong.” She then subtitled a work called</span><a href="https://www.radioatlas.org/writer-2/"><span> “Writer,</span></a><span>” an expansive piece in which the Belgian audio artist Katharina Smets evokes her encounter with a Detroit-based poet in his home, in all its poetic, discomfiting detail. Then came “Robbery,” a rousing piece from Argentina about that country’s 2001 financial crisis.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For most of these pieces, McDowall used translations by native speakers of the language, often the audio artists themselves.“I’m actually a fairly terrible linguist so I need a translation in front of me in order to grasp it,” she says. She subtitled each of these pieces slowly and painstakingly, on nights and weekends, using the software Final Cut Pro.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The heightened process of paying attention to tiny details—from specific region-specific quirks of radio production to the poetic turns-of-phrase of the translators she worked with—challenged her and reinvigorated her love of the medium.&nbsp;“There’s been so much I’ve heard that’s made me think about my own work that I’m making,” she says. “Bold use of sound and metaphor, the slowness and space in some work, fictional narrators in investigative documentaries, surreal humor in others, inventive interview techniques and so much more.”</span></p><hr><p><b>A dangerously one-sided conversation&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>In the past four years, McDowall has subtitled 45 podcast pieces for her video podcast. Among her favorites are a “very relatable” French podcast episode, “Mum Here,” featuring voice messages from mothers; a Swedish piece from the 1990s about a young woman’s dispiriting dating experience; and </span><a href="https://www.radioatlas.org/when-i-touched-the-ground/"><span>“When I touched the ground,”</span></a><span> a breathtakingly poetic piece in which one of the last remaining speakers of the traditional Indigenous language Pitjantjatjara relates the moment of her birth in a central Australian desert mesa.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The experience has made McDowall painfully aware of the “dangerously one-sided conversation” that has been taking place in the world of podcasting. “So much English-language audio flows easily across borders—because of the awful historical behavior of this country meaning this language is so widely spoken—but next to nothing comes in the other direction,” she says. “This feels like a dangerously one-sided conversation where, for example, podcasts like </span><i><span>Serial</span></i><span> can travel the world but inventive, bold, fascinating audio art from places where English is not the first language aren’t traveling in the other direction.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>McDowall thinks “so many things” are lost due to our monolingual listening diets. “From the perspective of understanding the world we inhabit, I think it’s never good if your idea of a place you don’t live is informed by reports that come from a touristic perspective, or ones that privilege the voices of people who just happen to speak your language,” she says. “Also, there’s the myriad different styles and approaches which we don’t get to hear because of the language barrier that might influence or challenge work we’re used to listening to in Anglophone countries.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This mission has been critically lauded. </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span> has been featured at film and audio festivals around the world. It has also received awards, including a Special Commendation at the </span><a href="http://prixeuropa.eu/home"><span>Prix Europa</span></a><span> in 2016 and the Silver Award for Best New Podcast at the </span><a href="https://www.britishpodcastawards.com/nominations-2018-2"><span>British Podcast Awards</span></a><span> in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><hr><p><b>A podcaster’s podcaster&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>An increase in critical recognition has not, however, resulted in corresponding audience growth. When I asked McDowall about </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span>’s listenership figures, she replied, with a laugh, “Oh god, so tiny! It’s grown steadily but in very small increments! It’s a pretty niche listen. Individual episodes are listened to in the low thousands according to my stats—a small but loving following!”</span></p><p><span>As small as this may be to industry leaders such as the</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/new-york-times-the-daily-podcast-1-billion-downloads-05b0f648-5287-4995-bc37-421883f882b8.html"> <i><span>New York Time</span></i><span>s po</span><span>dcast </span></a><i><span>The Daily,</span></i><span> which rack up downloads in the millions, this is not too bad for podcasts that are a relatively challenging listen. Unlike the usual podcast listening experience, which can run in the background and be semi-ignored as you go about doing your household chores, a </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span> piece requires your full concentration. You have to listen to the voice and the sounds and watch the subtitles float in and out on screen. But McDowall says she is heartened to see how many listeners are “open, interested” and willing to give such pieces their full attention, despite how far they are from the most popular modes of audio production. “In general I’m always surprised and delighted by how adventurous and accepting listeners are with those sorts of experiences as soon as they’re in them,” she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Not surprisingly, a large part of the listenership of </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span> is composed of fellow audio-makers, “people curious to hear new approaches or access work outside of their language.” And then, McDowall has noticed an uptick in listeners drawn from translation communities and language learners.“But what would delight me is just reaching as many people as possible with the central premise,” she says. “A reminder that every other artform they engage in can draw in work from languages they don’t speak and offer ways to access it. I want us to be talking more about how much of the world we’re not hearing in audio because of the language barriers between audio cultures.”</span></p><hr><p><b>More listening venues&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>In the pre-pandemic era, McDowall found cinema screenings worked “incredibly well” for </span><i><span>Radio Atlas</span></i><span>. “It sits very easily in a cinematic space, and more closely mirrors how you might imagine watching a film than it does how you might imagine listening to a podcast,” she says. “Building a space where people really</span></p><p><span>focus on the work has been very rewarding and meant that great audio work has moved very easily into documentary film spaces where it reaches new audiences.” The podcast also does well when shared on social media. “The visual aspect has also been helpful as clips of Radio Atlas podcasts basically already look like audiograms,” says McDowall.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>An interesting recent development, which McDowall hopes to make use of in the future, is Spotify’s decision to roll out complementary videos alongside its podcasts.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249389/spotify-video-podcast-test-upload-content-test-youtube"><span>This May</span></a><span>, it decided to test out this new feature with two hybrid vodcasts, on its app. “I don’t know enough about it yet,” McDowall says, “but it sounds like it might be a very useful tool to normalize subtitles and access to translations!”</span></p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Javascript became the most popular language in the world and with popularity “hardcore” engineers started to harass js developers and ecosystem. I have no interest in finding where this toxicity came from, but one of the stated issues is the size of a <code>node_modules</code> directory. I always wondered how this is that different from other toolchains: I have a lot of experience with C# (backend), Java/Kotlin (Android), Go (backend), Python (ML), ObjectiveC/Swift (iOS), Scala (backend) and some experience with ocaml/f#/haskel, and experience with NodeJS is so far the most predictable and depdendency tree is actually very <strong>compact</strong>.</p>
<p>TLDR: Sizes of installations for various languages to build UI app:</p>
<ul>
<li>NodeJS: 527MB (plain installation) + 182MB (node_modules)</li>
<li>Android: 914MB (plain installation)</li>
<li>iOS: 20+GB (plain installation)</li>
<li>Go: 659MB (plain installation) + 125MB (linux ui libraries)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://korshakov.com/content/node_modules_meme.png" alt="node_modules meme"></p>
<h2 id="main-difference-from-other-dependency-systems"><a href="#main-difference-from-other-dependency-systems" aria-label="main difference from other dependency systems permalink"></a>Main difference from other dependency systems</h2>
<p>One of the main power of NodeJS is an ability to use multiple versions of a single library within the same build. JS ecosystem is huge mostly because of how it is easy to publish anything, low bar for starting coding and the fact that this is most used language in the world that could run almost anywhere. Since JS is quite old at lack some huge stdlib you just need to use a lot small libraries that solves some specific problem for you. There was a lot of attempts to build some stdlib, but community simply too versatile to have a one-fits-all solution. You can think of it as a Scala ecosystem with a lot of ideas and experimental libraries that sometimes not that practical. Diversity is a huge win. For example because of React we now see declarative paradigms of UI programming in almost any ecosystem. Because you could have so many types of libraries you can choose between performance and easy of use. You can pick native bindings for sql, but could choose JS one, you can have a dozen of different ORMs or write yor own. All this makes JS ecosystem very strong and diverse.</p>
<h2 id="nodejs-benchmark-application"><a href="#nodejs-benchmark-application" aria-label="nodejs benchmark application permalink"></a>NodeJS benchmark application</h2>
<p>We are going to measure NodeJS size with Docker with base image <code>ubuntu:20.04</code>. Base image size is ~74MB and we will substract this size to get net size of nodejs setup.</p>
<p>Using docker</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>FROM ubuntu:20.04
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt update &amp;&amp; apt install -y nodejs npm</code></pre></div>
<p>We get size:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>REPOSITORY          SIZE
test-node           601MB</code></pre></div>
<p>So far our plain node installation is 527MB. This is not the smallest installation possible, there are a slim packages avaiable that have size ~55MB total, but we are here to test dev environment, not production deployment.</p>
<p>Let’s add some npm packages:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npm install express typescript webpack next</code></pre></div>
<p>We get image size:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>REPOSITORY          SIZE
test-node           783MB</code></pre></div>
<p>And resulting installation of nodejs with some frameworks is <strong>709MB</strong>. This makes <code>node_modules</code> to be <strong>182MB</strong> (709MB - 527MB), where Typescript size is ~80MB. NextJS is another ~80MB.</p>

<p>Well you could say that this is awful comparing NodeJS to Android, but i would say no, it is completely adequate: you are going to build an app for the most used OS in the world that makes this toolchain the most popular one.</p>
<p>To measure Android SDK actual size on disk i am going to use Docker images for predictable results. I found that a very minimal and clean <a href="https://github.com/thyrlian/AndroidSDK/blob/master/android-sdk/Dockerfile" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dockerfile for Android SDK</a> already exist. It was built on top of <code>ubuntu:20.04</code>. To measure Android SDK size we will simply subsctract size of result image from base one.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>REPOSITORY             SIZE
thyrlian/android-sdk   988MB</code></pre></div>
<p>So, just to compile your android app you need a minimum of a wooping <strong>914MB</strong>. Also this docker image <strong>DOES NOT</strong> have an actual SDK in it, just java, kotlin, SDK manager and needed dependencies. Adding required platforms would boost it for another couple of megabytes. We can also try to count emulators as you probabbly will need couple of them instead of dozen of hardware devices, each emulator will be at least 1gb, much less than an additional browser (that requires only 100MB free on disk).</p>
<p>And you would say: this disk space is reused! Yes and no. SDK could be reused, that’t true, but android development is a combination of Android Studio, Gradle and Java/Kotlin. This trio deeply integrated and if you want to upgrade something you have to upgrade something else. Often you just pick to stick to specific versions for a while until something will require an upgrade and if it would require upgrade of a Kotlin than it could mean that you have to update your code, some libraries and what’s not. Sometimes latest versions simply not working. Sometimes libraries just dissapear from google repositories and you just have to upgrade and once in a while it happens just in the day of release.</p>

<p>Measuring size of an iOS toolchain is a very tricky part. But XCode requires you to have at least 20GB of disk space. Each version of iOS would eat another gigabyte. This list could go and go. Any fat binary usualy have 100MB+ size. Cocoapods and friends download sources for your projects and you have to wait for minutes to compile. My current app on top MBP takes 10+ minutes right now. During build they spawn a large amount of binary files that could became quite large.</p>
<p>Talking about dependency tree it is much more flat, but it is mostly about dificulities of reusing libraries. For example it is almost impossible to mix two versions of a single library, like, React Native use one version of Yoga and Texture uses another one and they are incompatible. Most of the libraries if need something they just vendor it or implement small feature by themself instead of relying on a community. Dependencies between projects are mostly whithin a single entity (organization, community) and almost never reused between. We all wish if it could work, but it is simply impossible to have anything deep in practice. This leads that usually every library have their own LRU cache, their own collections and etc. All of them have bugs and not developed within a single community.</p>
<h2 id="golang"><a href="#golang" aria-label="golang permalink"></a>Golang</h2>
<p>Installing a golang in a Docker is quite simple, but we need to also install gcc since a lot of packages requires.</p>
<p>For empty installation we are getting</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>REPOSITORY          SIZE
test-node           733MB</code></pre></div>
<p>So our pure installation of a Go is <strong>659MB</strong></p>
<p>But this is not fair, we are benchmarking building ui apps, web or desktop. Google have UI library (gxui) for go that requires dependencies: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxxf86vm-dev</code></pre></div>
<p>Lets’s install them:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>REPOSITORY          SIZE
test-node           858MB</code></pre></div>
<p>So installation that is ready to use without application dependencies is <strong>784MB</strong>.</p>
<p>Before go modules dependencies was quite fragile in golang world, but not everyone moved to them yet. In golang an actual dependency tree could go very deep just like NodeJS.</p>
<h2 id="results"><a href="#results" aria-label="results permalink"></a>Results</h2>
<p>If you pick any generic ecosystem that wasn’t built for small developer environment footprint you will always get to use a lot of disk space. </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.</p><p>As software engineers our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text, like in the form of a design doc, may be the better tool for solving problems early in a project lifecycle, as it may be more concise and easier to comprehend, and communicates the problems and solutions at a higher level than code.</p><p>Besides the original documentation of a software design, design docs fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:</p><ul><li><p>Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.</p></li><li><p>Achieving consensus around a design in the organization.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns.</p></li><li><p>Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization.</p></li><li><p>Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.</p></li><li><p>Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).</p></li></ul><h2 id="anatomy-of-a-design-doc">Anatomy of a design doc <a href="#anatomy-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h2><p>Design docs are informal documents and thus don’t follow a strict guideline for their content. Rule #1 is: Write them in whatever form makes the most sense for the particular project.</p><p>Having said that, a certain structure has established itself as really useful.</p><h3 id="context-and-scope">Context and scope <a href="#context-and-scope">#</a></h3><p>This section gives the reader a very rough overview of the landscape in which the new system is being built and what is actually being built. This isn’t a requirements doc. Keep it succinct! The goal is that readers are brought up to speed but some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to. This section should be entirely focused on objective background facts.</p><h3 id="goals-and-non-goals">Goals and non-goals <a href="#goals-and-non-goals">#</a></h3><p>A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. Note, that non-goals aren’t negated goals like “The system shouldn’t crash”, but rather things that could reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. A good example would be “ACID compliance”; when designing a database, you’d certainly want to know whether that is a goal or non-goal. And if it is a non-goal you might still select a solution that provides it, if it doesn’t introduce trade-offs that prevent achieving the goals.</p><h3 id="the-actual-design">The actual design <a href="#the-actual-design">#</a></h3><p>This section should start with an overview and then go into details.</p><p><img alt="Visualization of how to draw an owl. First picture: two circles labeled &quot;1. Draw some circles&quot;. Second picture: Picture of an own labeled &quot;2.

Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value. That is, given the context (facts), goals and non-goals (requirements), the design doc is the place to suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals.</p><p>The point of writing a document over a more formal medium is to provide the flexibility to express the problem set at hand in an appropriate manner. Because of this, there is no explicit guidance for how to actually describe the design.</p><p>Having said that, a few best practices and repeating topics have emerged that make sense for a large percentage of design docs:</p><h4 id="system-context-diagram"><strong>System-context-diagram</strong> <a href="#system-context-diagram">#</a></h4><p>In many docs a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram">system-context-diagram</a></em> can be very useful. Such a diagram shows the system as part of the larger technical landscape and allows readers to contextualize the new design given its environment that they are already familiar with.</p><p><img alt="Block diagram showing how various systems are related to each other. The actual text is just examples and not needed to be seen to understand the example." height="333" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N.png" width="655" decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-320w.jpg 320w"><br><em>Example of a system-context-diagram.</em></p><h4 id="apis">APIs <a href="#apis">#</a></h4><p>If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that API is usually a good idea. In most cases, however, one should withstand the temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of date. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="data-storage">Data storage <a href="#data-storage">#</a></h4><p>Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. Similar to the advice on APIs, and for the same reasons, copy-pasting complete schema definitions should be avoided. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="code-and-pseudo-code">Code and pseudo-code <a href="#code-and-pseudo-code">#</a></h4><p>Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to prototypes that show the implementability of the design.</p><h4 id="degree-of-constraint">Degree of constraint <a href="#degree-of-constraint">#</a></h4><p>One of the primary factors that would influence the shape of a software design and hence the design doc, is the degree of constraint of the solution space.</p><p>On one end of the extreme is the “greenfield software project”, where all we know are the goals, and the solution can be whatever makes the most sense. Such a document may be wide-ranging, but it also needs to quickly define a set of rules that allow zooming in on a manageable set of solutions.</p><p>On the other end are systems where the possible solutions are very well defined, but it isn’t at all obvious how they could even be combined to achieve the goals. This may be a legacy system that is difficult to change and wasn’t designed to do what you want it to do or a library design that needs to operate within the constraints of the host programming language.</p><p>In this situation you may be able to enumerate all the things you can do relatively easily, but you need to creatively put those things together to achieve the goals. There may be multiple solutions, and none of them are really great, and hence such a document should focus on selecting the best way given all identified trade-offs.</p><h3 id="alternatives-considered">Alternatives considered <a href="#alternatives-considered">#</a></h3><p>This section lists alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes. The focus should be on the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the design that is the primary topic of the document.</p><p>While it is fine to be succinct about solution that ended up not being selected, this section is one of the most important ones as it shows very explicitly why the selected solution is the best given the project goals and how other solutions, that the reader may be wondering about, introduce trade-offs that are less desirable given the goals.</p><h3 id="cross-cutting-concerns">Cross-cutting concerns <a href="#cross-cutting-concerns">#</a></h3><p>This is where your organization can ensure that certain cross-cutting concerns such as security, privacy, and observability are always taken into consideration. These are often relatively short sections that explain how the design impacts the concern and how the concern is addressed. Teams should standardize what these concerns are in their case.</p><p>Due to their importance, Google projects are required to have a dedicated privacy design doc, and there are dedicated reviews for privacy and security. While the reviews are only required to be completed by the time a project launches, it is best practice to engage with privacy and security teams as early as possible to ensure that designs take them into account from the ground up. In case of dedicated docs for these topics, the central design doc can, of course, reference them instead of going into detail.</p><h3 id="the-length-of-a-design-doc">The length of a design doc <a href="#the-length-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h3><p>Design docs should be sufficiently detailed but short enough to actually be read by busy people. The sweet spot for a larger project seems to be around 10-20ish pages. If you get way beyond that, it might make sense to split up the problem into more manageable sub problems. It should also be noted that it is absolutely possible to write a 1-3 page “mini design doc”. This is especially helpful for incremental improvements or sub tasks in an agile project–you still do all the same steps as for a longer doc, just keep things more terse and focused on a limited problem set.</p><h2 id="when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">When <em>not</em> to write a design doc. <a href="#when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">#</a></h2><p>Writing design docs is overhead. The decision whether to write a design doc comes down to the core trade-off of deciding whether the benefits in organizational consensus around design, documentation, senior review, etc. outweigh the extra work of creating the doc. At the center of that decision lies whether the solution to the design problem is ambiguous–because of problem complexity or solution complexity, or both. If it is not, then there is little value in going through the process of writing a doc.</p><p>A clear indicator that a doc might not be necessary are design docs that are really <em>implementation manuals</em>. If a doc basically says “This is how we are going to implement it” without going into trade-offs, alternatives, and explaining decision making (or if the solution is so obvious as to mean there were no trade-offs), then it would probably have been a better idea to write the actual program right away.</p><p>Finally, the overhead of creating and reviewing a design doc may not be compatible with prototyping and rapid iteration. However, most software projects do have a set of <em>actually known problems</em>. Subscribing to agile methodologies is not an excuse for not taking the time to get solutions to actually known problems right. Additionally, prototyping itself may be part of the design doc creation. “I tried it out and it works” is one of the best arguments for choosing a design.</p><h2 id="the-design-doc-lifecycle">The design doc lifecycle <a href="#the-design-doc-lifecycle">#</a></h2><p>The steps in the lifecycle of a design document are:</p><ol><li>Creation and rapid iteration</li><li>Review (may be in multiple rounds)</li><li>Implementation and iteration</li><li>Maintenance and learning</li></ol><h3 id="creation-and-rapid-iteration">Creation and rapid iteration <a href="#creation-and-rapid-iteration">#</a></h3><p>You write the doc. Sometimes together with a set of co-authors.</p><p>This phase quickly evolves into a time of rapid iteration where the doc is shared with colleagues who have the most knowledge about the problem space (often belonging to the same team) and through their clarifying questions and suggestions drive the doc to a first relatively stable version.</p><p>While you certainly find engineers and even teams who prefer version control and code …</p></article></div></div>

Vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs) form the basis of more sophisticated models, such as LSTMs and GRUs. There are lots of great articles, books, and videos that describe the functionality, mathematics, and behavior of RNNs so, don't worry, this isn't yet another rehash. (See below for a list of resources.) My goal is to present an explanation that avoids the neural network metaphor, stripping it down to its essence—a series of vector transformations that result in embeddings for variable-length input vectors.
</p>

<p>
My learning style involves pounding away at something until I'm able to re-create it myself from fundamental components. This helps me to understand exactly <b>what</b> a model is doing and <b>why</b> it is doing it.  You can ignore this article if you're familiar with  standard neural network layers and are comfortable with RNN explanations that use them as building blocks. Since I'm still learning the details of neural networks, I wanted to (1) peer through those layers to the matrices and vectors beneath and (2) investigate the details of the training process. My starting point was <a href="https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086">Karpathy's RNN code snippet</a> associated with <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks</a> and then I absorbed details from Chapter 12 from Jeremy Howard's / Sylvain Gugger's book <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch</a> and Chapter 12 from Andrew Trask's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Deep-Learning-Andrew-Trask/dp/1617293709">Grokking Deep Learning</a>.

In this article, I hope to contribute a simple and visually-focused data-transformation perspective on RNNs using a trivial data set that maps words for "cat" to the associated natural language.   The animation on the right was taken (and speeded up) from a <a href="https://youtu.be/ppz0XdEcGF4">youtube clip</a> I made for this article. For my actual PyTorch-based implementations, I've provided notebooks that use a nontrivial <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunkim/PyTorchZeroToAll/master/data/names_train.csv.gz">family name to natural language</a> data set.

<h2>TL;DR &nbsp;Details I learned </h2>



As I tried to learn RNNs, my brain kept wondering about the implementation details and key concepts, such as what exactly was contained in the hidden state vector.  My brain appears to be so literal that it can't understand anything until it sees the entire picture in depth.   For those in a hurry, let me summarize some of the key things I learned by implementing RNNs with nothing but matrices and vectors.  The full table of contents for the full article appears below.

<ul>
	<li>What exactly is <i>h</i> (sometimes called <i>s</i>) in the recurrence relation representing an RNN: <img src="https://explained.ai/rnn/images/blkeqn-F224DE1728AA3CC4724E5AE9C5429D65.svg"> (leaving off the nonlinearity)? The variable name <i>h</i> is typically used because it represents the <b>h</b>idden state of the RNN. An RNN takes a variable-length input record of symbols (e.g., stock price sequence, document, sentence, or word) and generates a fixed-length vector in high dimensional space, called an embedding, that somehow meaningfully represents or encodes the input record. The vector is only associated with a single input record and is only meaningful in the context of a classification or regression problem; the RNN is just a component of a surrounding model.  For example, the <i>h</i> vector is often passed through a final linear layer <i>V</i> (multiclass logistic regressor) to get model predictions. 	</li>
	<li>Does <i>h</i> contain learned parameters of the model? No. Vector <i>h</i> is a local variable holding the partial result as we process symbols of a single record but becomes the final embedding vector after the RNN processes the final input symbol. This vector is not updated as part of the gradient descent process; it is computed using the recurrence relation given above.</li>
	<li>Is <i>h</i> the RNN output?  I think it depends on your perspective. Yes, that embedding vector comes out of the RNN and becomes the input to following layers, but it's definitely not the output of the entire model. The model output comes from, say, the application of another matrix, <i>V</i> to <i>h</i>.</li>
	<li>What is <i>t</i> and does it represent time? If your variable-length input record is a timeseries like sensor or stock quote data, then yes <i>t</i> represents time. Variable <i>t</i> is really just the iterator variable used by the RNN to step through the symbols of a single input record.</li>
	<li>What is <i>backpropagation through time</i> (BPTT)? BPTT is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as applied to the specific case of RNNs that often process timeseries data. Backpropagation by itself means updating the parameters of the model in the direction of lower loss. BPTT refers to the case where we perform BP on <i>m</i> layers that reuse the same <i>W</i> and <i>U</i> for <i>m</i> symbols in the input record.</li>
	<li>Then what's <i>truncated backpropagation</i> or truncated BPTT? (First, let me point out that we don't need truncated BPTT for fairly short input records, such as we have for family names; my examples do not need to worry about truncated BPTT.) For large input records, such as documents, gradients across all (unrolled) RNN layers become expensive to compute and tend to vanish or explode, depending on our nonlinear activation function. To overcome this problem, we can simply stop the BP process after a certain number of gradient computations in the computation graph. It means not being able to update the model parameters based upon input symbols much earlier in the input stream.  I sometimes see the length of the truncated window represented with variable <tt>bptt</tt> in code, which is pretty confusing. <b>Note</b> that <i>h</i> is still computed using the full computation as described by the recurrence relation.  Truncated BP simply refers to how much information we use from BP to update the parameter models in <i>W</i> and <i>U</i> (and usually <i>V</i>). Vector <i>h</i> uses <i>W</i> and <i>U</i> but is not updated by BP. Model <tt>LMModel3</tt> and Section "Maintaining the State of an RNN" of <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb">Chapter 12 in the fastai book</a> explain this in detail.</li>
	<li>Each variable <i>h</i> is associated with a single input record and is initialized to the zero vector at the start of the associated record.</li>
	<li>Matrices <i>W</i>, <i>U</i>, <i>V</i> are <b>initialized</b> exactly once: before training begins.</li>
	<li>Matrices <i>W</i>, <i>U</i>, <i>V</i> are <b>updated</b> as part of the SGD process after the <i>h</i> embedding vector has been computed for each input record in the batch (or single word if using pure SGD). As we iterate through the symbols in time, the <i>W</i>, <i>U</i>, <i>V</i> matrices do not change, unless we are using truncated BPTT for very long input records.</li>
	<li>Minibatching is a small subset of the input records split between records, leaving all input records intact.  However, in the situation where the input records are very big, minibatching can even involve splitting individual records, rather than just between records. Each record in a minibatch requires a separate <i>h</i> vector, leading to matrix <i>H</i> in my examples.</li>
	<li>When combining one-hot vectors for minibatching purposes, we must pad on the left not the right to avoid changing the computation. See this section: <a href="https://explained.ai/rnn/minibatch.html#sec:2.2.2">Padding short words with 0 vectors on the left</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Table of contents</h2>

I've broken up this article into two main sections. The first section tries to identify how an RNN encodes a variable-length input record as a fixed-length vector by reinventing the mechanism in baby steps.   The second section is all about minibatching details and vectorizing the gradient descent training loop.

<h2>Resources</h2>

First off, if you are new to deep learning, check out Jeremy Howard's full course (with video lectures) called <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a>.

As for recurrent neural networks in particular, here are a few resources that I found  useful:
 
<ul>
<li>To get started with RNNs, I think the best first stop is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEnXr6v2ifU">MIT's RNN intro video</a> to get an overview.

</li><li>Karpathy's well-known <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">RNN blog</a> and associated <a href="https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086">code snippet</a> are really motivating and I used them as a basis to understand how the vectors flow through the RNN recurrence relation.

</li><li>Chapter 12 from Jeremy Howard's and Sylvain Gugger's book <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch</a> is chock-full of both high-level and low-level details. The other chapters are well worth reading too.
	
</li><li>Chapters 11 and 12 from Andrew Trask's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Deep-Learning-Andrew-Trask/dp/1617293709">Grokking Deep Learning</a> has a lot of good stuff on word vectors and RNNs.

</li><li>Section 6.2 in FranÃ§ois Chollet's <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python">Deep Learning with Python</a> book does a really nice discussion and implementation using neural network layers; the book is very clearly written. It does, however, focus on keras whereas I'm using PyTorch for tensors in this article.

</li><li>Yannet Interian has a good <a href="https://github.com/yanneta/dl-course/blob/master/rnn-name2lang.ipynb">notebook for training RNNs that map family names to languages</a>.
</li></ul>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

I'd like to thank Yannet Interian, also faculty in <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science">University of San Francisco's MS in Data Science program</a>, for acting as a resource and pointing me to relevant material.  <a href="https://twitter.com/bearpelican">Andrew Shaw</a> and <a href="https://zeigermann.eu/">Oliver Zeigermann</a> also answered a lot of my questions and filled in lots of implementation details.

<small>Ian Grant <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.hol/1889">kindly made this page available</a>. This was previously hosted at http://ian-grant.net/hm (but is not currently available there). Thanks Ian, this is an awesome tutorial!</small>


<p>Robin Milner's type system with parametric polymorphism was a
significant advance over the systems of Russell and Church. Arguably
it is the ability to use type-variables that makes higher order logic
a practical vehicle for proving non-trivial theorems. The
Hindley-Milner algorithm is used to automatically infer types in
theorem provers and in several other functional programing languages.

</p><p>The algorithm, the type system, and some of the logical background are explained
in <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.pdf">this tutorial</a>, along with an implementation
in standard ML.
</p><p><img src="http://steshaw.org/hm/hm.png">
</p><p>This implementation is purely functional and is intended to show
the algorithm as clearly as possible. The image above is meant to show
that functional languages can be used to express mathematics and logic
in such a way that the correspondence between the mathematical and the
programmatic expressions may be as exact as one wishes. 

</p><p>This has practical consequences. In implementing the algorithm in
ML I found several errors and ambiguities in the mathematical
expression. These were cleared up in the process of constructing the
mechanical expression of the algorithm. The errors would have been
detected by the syntax and type-checking of the compiler, and the
ambiguity is resolved by the specification of standard ML semantics
which is more precise than any informal description of mathematical
notation that I have ever seen. Because ML is equally expressive but
more exact, I argue that the ML program is a a <i>better</i>
description of the algorithm than the mathematical one.

</p><p>Standard ML is Milner's language which uses this parametric
polymorphic type system. The core of the implementation of the type
inference algorithm consists in some 250 lines of code. It does not
include any explicit type annotation at all, yet the type of each and
every expression is inferred (and thereby checked) by the same
algorithm which is part of the compiler.

</p><p>The algorithm was proved sound and complete by Damas and Milner in
1982 and the proof is outlined in <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/milner-damas.pdf">Principal
type-schemes for functional programs</a> which I have re-keyed because
the paper is so well-written and deserves to be more widely read.

</p><p>The source code is available as
a <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.sml">plain text SML source file</a> and
as <a href="http://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.html">html formatted standard ML</a>.

					<div><p>Snovio is one of my personal favorite email finder tools.
</p><p>

Why?
</p><p>

It’s extremely robust and the closest comparison to Icy Leads.
</p><p>

Their plans are affordable and they allow you to find emails and send cold email sequences to them through email drip campaigns.
</p><p>

The only downside I’ve found to Snovio is the fact that they charge based on credits.
</p><p>

So if you’re looking for flexibility and don’t mind paying for a high volume of found emails, Snovio may be for you.</p></div>

They allow you to search their entire database and filter out the prospects that you don’t want to contact.

The data enrichment feature is also really cool because most of these other email finders don’t have this.

                    <h3 id="the-foodnoms-origin-story">The FoodNoms Origin Story</h3><p>One year ago, July 4th, 2019, was my last day at my previous employer. It was the end of a dream startup experience. I left having received exactly what I came for: to experience what it’s like to join at an early-stage startup and grow along with the company.</p><p>I was awarded many opportunities at my job. I led strategic projects. I grew as both an engineer and a leader. I was able to mentor junior engineers, lead tech talks, and make architectural decisions. However, I pushed myself really hard. Too hard. Despite being rewarded and celebrated for all of my efforts, I burned out at the end of my four years there.</p><p>My burn out was a wake up call. It made me realize I had focused too much on my work and lost touch with some of my own personal values. I knew it would be a mistake to jump into another full time job. I needed “me time”.</p><p>A normal person might have decided to just kick back, relax, maybe travel the world. I didn't want that though. I just wanted to do one thing: make a product just by myself.</p><p>I didn't waste any time. Right away I got to thinking about what to build. I knew I wanted to build something consumer-focused for a change. I did a brief brainstorming exercise: what apps do I use on my phone: (a) I frequently use, (b) makes money, (c) I could build in a few months, and (d) I don’t enjoy using.</p><p>This exercise was really effective and immediately led to the idea of building a food tracking app. The food trackers I tried were all slow, ugly, filled with ads and irrelevant content, were obnoxious with upsells, and didn't seem to improve at all over time. I knew it was a good idea because I immediately had a ton of ideas for how I could make something better.</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/sketch.png"><figcaption>Notes and sketches from one of my earlier brainstorming exercises</figcaption></figure><p>I immediately got to work building what would become FoodNoms. Here's the first screenshot I have of the first version of the app, taken a little over a year ago, next to what the app looks like today:</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/IMG_3410-1.png" width="1125" height="2436"></p><p><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/1-1.png" width="1242" height="2688"></p></div></div><figcaption>Left: The first prototype. Right: The app today, one year and over 2000 commits later.</figcaption></figure><p>At the start of this journey, I only had one goal: ship an MVP sometime in Fall 2019. I realized this was super ambitious, but I knew I could do it. I grinded really hard those next four months to make it happen.</p><p>What happened next really took me by surprise. FoodNoms had a fantastic launch and a great reception. Suddenly I had hundreds of paying customers with lots of feedback.</p><hr><p>After the launch in 2019, I decided to commit to spending a few more months focusing 100% of my time on the project. Those next few months evolved into six months, and here I am one year later after I started.</p><p>I did not originally plan to still be focusing 100% of my time on FoodNoms a year later after I started it. I also didn't expect it to be really appreciated, downloaded, or supported. These past twelve months have been incredible. I've learned so much and grown in many different ways that I did not expect. Even though I have made many mistakes and the product is far from perfect, I'm extremely proud of what I've built.</p><p>I'm writing this post to share some of the things I've learned, celebrate what I'm proud of, and open up about some of my struggles.</p><h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2><p>I wish I could proudly start off the rest of this post boasting about my massive amounts of downloads and financial success. If you've been following along my story, you already know that the reality is FoodNoms has a long way to go in these departments. Here is where the app is at today:</p><ul><li>Days on the App Store: 240</li><li>Downloads: 12,397 (average 52/day)</li><li>Total revenue (post Apple's cut): $7,694</li><li>Current DAU (note, active usage means logging food): 200-300+</li><li>Total app updates shipped: 20</li><li>Current subscription churn rate: ~10%</li><li>US App Store: 4.8 stars with 203 ratings</li><li>App Store International Average: 4.7 stars with 304 ratings</li></ul><p>Here's a chart of downloads over time where you can see just how big of a launch FoodNoms had, as well as the impact of the recent exposure FoodNoms has received on <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/1278074906270466051?s=20">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://atp.fm/385">ATP</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/appfigures.com_reports_date--8-.png"><figcaption>Downloads over time since launch</figcaption></figure><p>However, if you exclude the launch and recent days, FoodNoms has only received 3,581 downloads, or an average of 17 per day.</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/appfigures.com_reports_date--6-.png"><figcaption>Downloads over time, excluding launch and recent events</figcaption></figure><p>For an app with very cheap subscription plans, without large downloads, it's incredibly hard to build a sustainable business. No matter how good your conversion and retention rate is.</p><p>One positive note here is that I currently have 492 active subscription trials, thanks to all of the recent exposure. I have a fairly high conversion rate, so I expect MRR to shoot up quite a bit in the coming weeks.</p><p>While I wish that I had made more than just $7.5k in my first year doing indie development, I am more concerned about the lack of downloads and growth.</p><p>The main metric I look at is the the number of users that log food every day on a rolling average. On the left, you can clearly see the climb and fall of all the initial adopters that churned after the launch. This metric continued to decline until it bottomed out at 97 users in mid-March. Since then, it's been climbing slowly upwards until July where it has started to spike some.</p><figure><img src="https://ryanashcraft.com/content/images/2020/07/analytics.amplitude.com_algebraic-labs_chart_drj9wu1_edit_pdhsbxc.png"><figcaption>7-Day moving average of active users (note, absolute numbers are a lower bound)</figcaption></figure><p>What caused the slow rebound in March?

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>I’ve been a big fan of Vim ever since my old boss <a href="https://github.com/dphase">Josh</a> introduced
me to it somewhere around 2014. Before that I had used mostly Sublime, but with a bit of
dabbling into Visual Studio and a couple of JetBrains IDEs. It of course took a while, but
once I had the basics down to muscle memory I was absolutely sold on Vim. It’s become just
how I type, and the little tricks that save a second or two here or there over the course of
a day add up to a real productivity gain. The <em>only</em> downside is that any time I’m typing into
something that doesn’t recognize vim keybindings I end up mashing escape too often and being
frustrated that things just don’t work as well.</p>

<p>Long story short, I just couldn’t get into any of the popular note taking apps because they
just weren’t Vim. I had a pretty short list of wants:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some sort of syncing or backup. I take lots of notes on paper and I love that I can grab
  a notebook from five years ago and quickly get insight into whatever was happening at that
  time. I’ve got notebooks going all the way back to my very first internship, and they’ve
  actually come in handy more than once. I needed syncing or backup because it’s easy to see
  a scenario in which my computer accidentally drinks a cup of coffee and <em>woosh</em> there go
  a years worth of notes. No thank you.</li>
  <li>Maybe open source? I wanted this for the same reason syncing and backup are important. I
  take notes because I want to remember something. If a company can go out of business and
  my notes are gone… well that’s just bad news for me. I wanted something that I felt had
  real lasting power. At some point I realized that it’s honestly hard to be just plain ole
  Markdown files.</li>
  <li>Easy to access. If notes are painful to take, I’m not going to take them. Maybe I’m just
  lazy, but it’s the truth. I wanted something that was just a click or <em>maybe</em> two away
  from me opening it and using it anytime I’m at my computer. I don’t even care that much for
  taking notes from my phone or anything – I just want it to be <em>super</em> easy from my computer.</li>
</ol>

<p>You’ve probably got several apps queued up in your head to recommend to me, right? Evernote
was always a big suggestion, and I <em>did</em> enjoy using it for a long time. It did syncing so 
I wasn’t worried about my computer having the only copy. It wasn’t open source, but it <em>was</em>
a paid app that I could at least try to help stay in business. It’s not like it was hard to
access either – just start the app when I first start working and use Spotlight Search to
quickly hop to it whenever I wanted to take a note.</p>

<p><em>But</em>. It wasn’t Vim. It wasn’t Markdown either, so I knew that any note I took in it was
only going to be really useful within Evernote. Plus I didn’t really make much use of any of
the cooler features because I’m a simple man and typically take simple notes. So I plugged
along with it, but I wasn’t necessarily <em>happy</em> about it, you know?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki">VimWiki</a>.</p>

<p>VimWiki is a “personal wiki for Vim – a number of linked text files that have their own
syntax highlighting.” It’s easy to access <em>(three keystrokes)</em> while I’m already in Vim, which if I’m on my 
computer working I 100% am. It’s got an easy to use diary feature, which is something I’d
been trying to do more often. It even supports Markdown, although I didn’t really use that
at first.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve got several months of use under my belt, I feel like I’ve nailed down a few things
that make it just about perfect for my needs.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-use-it-now">How I Use It Now</h3>

<h4 id="using-markdown">Using Markdown</h4>

<p>If you check out the project’s docs linked above, you’ll see that they’ve got their own syntax
that’s not at all hard to use. I’ve never used orgmode enough before to really know for sure,
but it at least <em>seems</em> similar. It’s a moot point though, because my very first suggestion
is to use Markdown instead. I’m sure there are benefits to the default syntax, but I know
Markdown well, I use it for just about everything else I write, <em>and</em> it renders well on
Github and Gitlab, which will be important later.</p>

<p>Telling VimWiki to use Mardown is as simple as adding this to your vimrc <em>(or init.vim)</em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>g:vimwiki_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>'path'</span><span>:</span> <span>'~/vimwiki/'</span><span>,</span> <span>'syntax'</span><span>:</span> <span>'markdown'</span><span>,</span> <span>'ext'</span><span>:</span> <span>'.md'</span><span>}]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Easy as pie. I didn’t do this at first so I had to do a fair amount of converting the default
syntax to Markdown, but that wasn’t very hard.</p>

<h4 id="gitlab-backups">Gitlab Backups</h4>

<p>I knew that I wanted my notes to be backed up and I figured that keeping everything in a 
git repository couldn’t be a bad idea. At first I would manually commit and push things up
whenever I thought about it, but that’s a bad plan because obviously I would never <em>plan</em> for
my laptop to bite it and me lose my notes.</p>

<p>I figured it would be easy to set up a cron job to just commit and push every fifteen minutes,
but it turns out MacOS deprecated the <code>crontab</code> command a long time ago. After I found
<a href="https://alvinalexander.com/mac-os-x/mac-osx-startup-crontab-launchd-jobs">this blog</a> I ended
up with this snippet located in <code>/Users/linell/Library/LaunchAgents</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;plist</span> <span>version=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;dict&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>Label<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>com.linell.vimwikibackup<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>ProgramArguments<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;array&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>/Users/linell/vimwiki/backup.sh<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/array&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>Nice<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;integer&gt;</span>1<span>&lt;/integer&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>StartInterval<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;integer&gt;</span>300<span>&lt;/integer&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>RunAtLoad<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;true/&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>StandardErrorPath<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>/tmp/vimwikibackup.err<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>StandardOutPath<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>/tmp/vimwikibackup.out<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/plist&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The file that it’s calling out to is stored directly in <code>~/vimwiki</code> and is as simple as this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cd</span> ~/vimwiki
git add <span>.</span>
git commit <span>-a</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"updated on </span><span>`</span><span>date</span> +<span>'%Y%m%d_%H:%M'</span><span>`</span><span>"</span>
git push origin master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this set up, I don’t have to worry about remembering to manually do anything <em>and</em> I 
can guarentee that I won’t lose too much work if things ever go south. It’s also got the 
nice benefit of being displayed really well on Gitlab. The only downside I’ve encountered in
this approach that I haven’t figured out yet is that links that VimWiki generates look like 
 <code>[Foo](Foo)</code>, which isn’t clickable in Gitlab. It’s been easy enough to just tack <code>.md</code> 
 on the end of the link so that it’s <code>[Foo](Foo.md)</code> though, which lets me click around
 and view everything in a nice interface.</p>

<h4 id="easy-access">Easy Access</h4>

<p>VimWiki is pretty darn easy to access from the jump. <code>&lt;Leader&gt;ww</code> opens the index file, which
is honestly what I use for most things. In my index file I’ve got a bunch of links generated
that will take me to the other pages that I use the vast majority of the time. There are a
ton of built in shortcuts that you can check out in their documentation, and you can find
cheatsheets like <a href="http://thedarnedestthing.com/vimwiki%20cheatsheet">this one</a> that make things
pretty easy to learn.</p>

<p>The only things I’ve really added to make my life easier are a command to open the diary
and another to open my scratch buffer. From the diary file you can see a list of all of your
diary entries, which is pretty self explanatory. The scratch buffer is another trick that I
picked up from Josh mentioned in the beginning of this post, and it’s simple but super
effective: it’s a file I use to just store random stuff I need to type out. It’s mostly little
snippets of code that I want to copy paste all at once, or things that don’t really need to
be in my project’s source control but I <em>do</em> want a record of having done. 
<a href="https://gist.github.com/dphase/1792d67b4ac06aea11a49ed801f18a7e">His command</a> is much cooler
but overkill for what I needed. I just created a regular link to a new file from my wiki
index and then a command to easily open it. The command probably sucks, but it works. Here
are both of those:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>command! Diary VimwikiDiaryIndex

"" Lame adaptation of Josh's buffer file here: 
""  https://gist.github.com/dphase/1792d67b4ac06aea11a49ed801f18a7e
function! s:DScratch()
  exe 'edit ~/vimwiki/Scratch Buffer.md'
endfunction

command! Scratch call s:DScratch(&lt;f-args&gt;)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>VimWiki works super well for everything I need for taking notes. It hits all of my criteria,
it’s easy to set up and use, and honestly it’s neat to not need <em>another</em> app. I’m sure I’ll continue to 
refine and improve my setup over time, but I can’t suggest it highly enough overall.</p>

      <article>
        

        <p>In my experience, when students learn data structures they (1) learn how they work theoretically (2) use off-the-shelf data structures to solve problems and (3) sometimes implement these data structures from scratch. However, I don’t often see classes exploring the off-the-shelf implementations, and the interesting practical considerations that come along with them.</p>

<p>When I was a TA for <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/">6.006</a>, I had students answer the following questions about Python dictionaries. I hope they were a fun way to experiment with hash tables “in the wild”–I definitely learned a lot while preparing this! Solutions are at the end.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Recall that Python implements dictionaries using a hash table with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing">open addressing</a>. Long story short, dictionaries have an underlying array that stores key-value pairs. When inserting a key, Python uses hash values to “probe” through this array in a specific sequence until it finds an open slot for that key. This post assumes you have a basic understanding of open addressing. If you’d like a refresher on hash table concepts, <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/SortSearch/Hashing.html">this</a> might help.</p>

<p>Also, the internals of a Python dictionary aren’t a mystery: you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/dictobject.c">source code</a>! If you don’t want to read through everything, there are a bunch of resources explaining Python dictionaries, like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/327311/how-are-pythons-built-in-dictionaries-implemented">this</a> and <a href="https://just-taking-a-ride.com/inside_python_dict/chapter1.html">this</a>.</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>

<h3 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h3>

<p>Use a Python program to determine how the size of a dictionary, in bytes, changes as you insert keys. How does this affect insertion time, and why?</p>

<h3 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h3>

<p>Assume you have inserted \(e\) entries into a hash table that has the capacity to store \(c\) entries. Define the <em>load factor</em> of the hash table as \(e/c\). In addition, define the <em>compactness factor</em> of the hash table as (number of bytes allocated to the \(e\) entries) divided by (number of bytes allocated to the entire table).</p>

<p>Recall that the size of a hash table periodically increases to keep the load factor below a certain threshold. What is the maximum compactness factor of a Python dictionary, and how does that compare to the maximum load factor? How has this changed over different versions of Python, and why? It might help to read the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython source</a>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h3>

<p>Consider object <code>A</code>, which returns a random integer in the range \([1, n]\) on <strong>every</strong> call to <code>__hash__</code>. What’s so bad about this? Provide two examples of problematic code using <code>A</code> objects and dictionaries, and explain what goes wrong.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>    

<span>class</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span>    

    <span>def</span> <span>__hash__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>randint</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>

<h3 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h3>

<p>Object <code>B</code> differs from <code>A</code> in that we return a <strong>deterministic</strong> hash value in the range \([1, n]\). For various values of \(n\) and \(k\), compute how long it takes to insert \(k\) <code>B(n)</code> objects into a dictionary. Does this match what you theoretically expect? How does this compare to the “real world,” and what explains the difference?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>

<p>Here are brief responses to these questions: unless otherwise stated, I’m running these on my Macbook Pro using Python 3.7.7.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-1">Problem 1</h3>

<p>First, we can use the following code to measure when the size of a Python dictionary changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sys</span>

<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>

<span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span>

<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>):</span>
    <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>last_size</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"key"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>"new size"</span><span>,</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>))</span>
        <span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This prints out the following, indicating that the table size <strong>doubles</strong> on certain insertions (it isn’t exact because dictionaries have a 96-byte overhead).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key 5 new size 376
key 10 new size 656
key 21 new size 1192
key 42 new size 2288
key 85 new size 4712
key 170 new size 9328
key 341 new size 18536
key 682 new size 36976
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also measure insertion time: here, we add \(N\) values to a dictionary, recording how long it takes to add each key. We add up the times over multiple trials to reduce noise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span>

<span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span>

<span># times[i] stores how long it takes to add 
# i to the dictionary
</span><span>times</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>N</span>

<span># Run multiple trials to reduce noise
</span><span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>):</span>
    <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span># For each i, measure how long it takes
</span>    <span># to add i and add the result to times[i]
</span>    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>):</span>
        <span>start_time</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>
        <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
        <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start_time</span>
        <span>times</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>t</span>
  
<span># Find the 5 values of i that took the longest 
# time to insert
</span><span>top</span> <span>=</span> <span>sorted</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>)),</span> <span>key</span><span>=</span><span>lambda</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>times</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span>
<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>top</span><span>[:</span><span>5</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>times</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This returns the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>682 0.027842044830322266
341 0.015052318572998047
170 0.0094757080078125
85 0.006536006927490234
42 0.0048770904541015625
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unsurprisingly, these correspond to when the dictionary size doubles! This is because Python needs to allocate a new array and reinsert all existing keys into that array, which explains why insertion into a Python dictionary is actually <strong>amortized</strong> \(\Theta(1)\) in expectation.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-1">Problem 2</h3>

<p>First, looking at <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/dict-common.h">dict-common.h</a> and <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Include/pyport.h">pyport.h</a>, we can deduce that the size of a dictionary entry is 24 bytes. Therefore, given a dictionary <code>d</code>, its compactness factor is equal to <code>len(d) * 24 / sys.getsizeof(d)</code>. This ratio is maximized right before the dictionary resizes. To measure this, we can modify our script from Problem 1:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sys</span>

<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>100000</span>

<span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span>

<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>):</span>
    <span>compactness</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>24.0</span> <span>/</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span>
    <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>last_size</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"key"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>"compactness"</span><span>,</span> <span>compactness</span><span>)</span>
        <span>last_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>getsizeof</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On Python 2.7, this prints the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key 5 compactness 0.428571428571
key 21 compactness 0.480916030534
key 85 compactness 0.608591885442
key 341 compactness 0.651177593889
key 1365 compactness 0.66272859686
key 5461 compactness 0.665677948885
key 21845 compactness 0.666419223299
key 87381 compactness 0.666604789308
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compactness factor clearly approaches \(2/3\), which matches the load factor stated in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Objects/dictobject.c">dictobject.c</a>. (Also, note that different versions of Python have different table resizing schemes.)</p>

<p>On Python 3.7, this prints the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>key 5 compactness 0.4838709677419355
key 10 compactness 0.6382978723404256
key 21 compactness 0.7682926829268293
key 42 compactness 0.8456375838926175
key 85 compactness 0.8916083916083916
key 170 compactness 0.865874363327674
key 341 compactness 0.8773584905660378
key 682 compactness 0.8830384117393181
key 1365 compactness 0.8859800951968845
key 2730 compactness 0.8874200888503629
key 5461 compactness 0.888160034695869
key 10922 compactness 0.8885213005396317
key 21845 compactness 0.8887065715603049
key 43690 compactness 0.7999243224109415
key 87381 compactness 0.7999627701453185
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Weird. The compactness factor approaches \(8/9\), but suddenly shifts to \(4/5\). In fact, the maximum load factor is still \(2/3\), but <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2016-September/146327.html">Python dictionaries have gotten more compact</a>.</p>

<p>So what’s changed? In the old implementation, dictionaries stored a single array of 24-byte entries. If a dictionary has capacity \(c\) and a maximum load factor of \(2/3\), then its maximum compactness factor is \((24 \cdot \frac{2}{3} c)/(24 \cdot c) = 2/3\).</p>

<p>This isn’t very efficient: if a third of the entries are always going to be unoccupied, we’re wasting 24 bytes on each of them. Python 3.6 solves this by storing an array of \(c\) <em>indices</em>, which it uses to access a separate array of \(\frac{2}{3} c\) 24-byte entries. When inserting a new key, Python (1) adds the key-value pair to the entries array (2) probes through the indices array until it finds an open slot and (3) stores the index of the new entry.</p>

<p>The size of these indices depends on the the value of \(c\): 1 byte if \(c &lt; 2^8 = 256\), 2 bytes if \(c &lt; 2^{16}= 65,536\) and so on. So for a dictionary with capacity \(2^8 \le c &lt; 2^{16}\), the maximum compactness factor will be \((24 \cdot \frac{2}{3} c) / (24 \cdot \frac{2}{3} c + 2 \cdot c) = 8/9\), which matches our observations. This is a pretty sizable improvement!</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-1">Problem 3</h3>

<p>In this example, setting <code>d[key]</code> then retrieving <code>d[key]</code> usually results in a <code>KeyError</code>: if the hash value changes, Python will be unable to locate the key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>key</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>])</span>    
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, setting the value of <code>d[key]</code> a second time should overwrite the first instance. If the hash value changes, however, it will insert <code>key</code> a second time and this program will print <code>2</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>key</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span>
<span>d</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"bar"</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moral of the story: hash functions should be deterministic.</p>

<h3 id="problem-4-1">Problem 4</h3>

<p>If we insert \(k\) keys into a dictionary with \(n\) hash values, we expect \(k/n\) keys to be assigned to each hash value. For each value of \(n\), inserting these \(k/n\) values should take \(1 + 2 + \dots + k/n = \Theta(k^2/n^2)\) time. This is because every time we add a new key, we need to probe through all existing keys with the same hash value before we find an open slot. Adding over all \(n\), the time it takes to insert all \(k\) keys should be \(\Theta(k^2/n)\) in expectation. Note that probe sequences can overlap, so this analysis isn’t 100% accurate–we’ll get to that later!</p>

<p>We can verify this using the following code, which adds \(k\) <code>B(n)</code> objects to a table and measures how long it takes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span> 

<span>def</span> <span>create_dict</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>):</span>
    <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span>start_time</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>k</span><span>):</span>
        <span>d</span><span>[</span><span>B</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)]</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start_time</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, for a few values of \(n\) we can see how insertion time varies with \(k\). Indeed, a regression will verify that insertion time increases quadratically with \(k\).</p>

<p><img src="https://akshayr.me/blog/images/chart1.svg"></p>

<p>Second, for a fixed value of \(k = 2000\) we can see how insertion time varies with \(n\). It shouldn’t be hard to verify that time is proportional to \(1/n\).</p>

<p><img src="https://akshayr.me/blog/images/chart2.svg"></p>

<p>Cool, these are consistent with our predictions!</p>

<p>So why doesn’t Python run into this slowdown? In short, hash collisions rarely happen …</p></article></section></div></div>

					<p>By now, most people have heard of, or at least the concepts popularized by, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovators Dilemma</a>, a book detailing how large companies often fail when new technology arises, for a multitude of reasons, including fear of canibalising their own markets by innovating. There is however another point I would like to bring up as to why large well established companies can be slow to innovate and find their lead slowly (or sometimes very rapidly) deteriorate. Large companies reward success and not innovation. </p><h2 id="individualism-vs-the-group-in-good-times-">Individualism vs The Group, in Good Times.</h2><blockquote>"Nobody Gets Fired for Buying IBM". </blockquote><p>When we think of an organization, we often think of it as being a large, singular monolithic unit working hard to ensure its self-preservation and growth, that however is very far from the truth. The truth is, organizations aren't single units, but a grouping of many single units all working mostly for one goal, their own self preservation, growth and success. Because while from the outside an organization might have a single identity, behind the curtain, everyone is still acting based on whats in their own best interest and so how well the organization does is based on how well the interests of the individual and the organization as a whole are aligned. Is it in the CEOs best interested to increase profit margins? Probably, especially if their compensation is directly linked to the companies performance. Is it in the VP of Engineer's best interest to move every system in the organization to the cloud to help save the company millions in infrastructure costs a year? Well probably not actually, as best case scenario they get a pat on the back, worst case, they get fired and have a permanent mark on their CV should the project fail. So what do most people do? They avoid risk. Especially when things are going well and the company is making more then enough profit to cover any exceptionally large costs they might have.</p><p>Which is why people bought IBMs. Because you wouldn't be fired for it. The safe decision might not be whats best for the company in the long run, it might not even be whats best for the company in the short term, but more often then not, it is a guarenteed risk-free decision for whichever middle manager is responsible for making the decision on which vendor to purchase from.</p><h2 id="safety-is-temporary">Safety is temporary</h2><p>Now, this might all seem great so far right? If you take no risks nothing can go wrong? Well no, because you're competitors aren't other organizations who are taking the same calculated risks as you, they are competitors who are coming up with new and innovative ways to do what you do, but better, faster and cheaper. And sure most of them might fail, but there are thousands of them, all working hard to unseat you, all taking different risks and coming up with different ways to tackle whichever problem you are solving, and even if the majority of them fail, eventually that small minority will succeed, and when they succeed it might already be too late, but you will find yourself faced with two options, buy them, or copy them. </p><p>However, as we know, many organizations punish risk, and a large acquisition is definitely a risky. Plus they might not even want to sell. While copying them, is even riskier, you're committing massive financial resources with no guarentee of success. </p><h2 id="individualism-vs-the-group-in-bad-times-">Individualism vs The Group, in Bad Times.</h2><p>And once again, it comes down to the individual vs the group. As an individual in a large company who has the ability to make the decision on how to tackle a fast growing competitor, you have three options, do nothing, do something, start calling recruiters. </p><p>If you do nothing, you're simply a passenger on a sinking ship.</p><p>If you do something, you're a screaming passenger on a sinking ship, and making you plug the whole, or maybe you find yourself being held responsible for creating news holes that have made the ship sink faster.</p><p>And if you start calling recruiter, you're potentially a star hire that a competitor can snatch away and write a press release about, giving more credibility to themselves.</p><p>What do most people chose? Well a look at all the ex-IBM executives and staff now working at competitors might help you understand that most of the time, people chose whats best for themselves. After all, in hindsight, they will remember being pretty vocal about needing to innovate, they were just never given the go-ahead.</p><h2 id="never-punish-risk">Never Punish Risk</h2><p>Which is why it is important to reward innovation and execution, and not just results. To innovate you will fail most of the time, just by taking a look at some of the most successful companies today, such as Amazon or Google we see that internally they have far more failures then successes. Failures such as Amazon's Fire Phone, or Google+. Despite these failures however, they have continued to grow at a pace far greater than any of their competitors, and though not ever new product or project succeeds, when they do they result in successes and new markets that more than make up for all the past failures before them.</p><p>Most importantly however, this creates a culture where the individuals best interests are more perfectly aligned with that of the organization. Because as long as you work hard and give it your best, you can innovate, take risks and be rewarded for your successes without being punished for your failures. Now every employee is potentially one of the thousands of competitors working to do what you do better, faster and cheaper, except when they succeed, you succeed with them.</p>

Wrong-ish</strong></h2><h3>Insight #6: The wisdom of the crowd is wise</h3><p>At the end of each trivia contest on Water Cooler Trivia, we ask a “tiebreaker” question with a numeric response. In case there’s a tie at the top of the leaderboard (like when two people get 8 out of 10 questions correct), the winner is determined by whoever was closer to the correct answer on the tiebreaker question. It’s like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right_(American_game_show)">The Price Is Right</a><em> </em>but without penalty for guessing too high.&nbsp;</p><p>We love noticing that the median response is often extremely<strong><em> </em></strong>close to the correct answer. <strong>When we asked about the ground length of the US-Mexico border, the median response was 1,800 miles which is only 8% off the correct answer of </strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2017/09/19/wall-how-long-us-mexico-border/676001001/"><strong>1,954 miles</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Hats off to the magical power of large numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>One more nerdy thing: over time, we’ve seen that the median is almost always closer to the correct answer than the mean, because we see the <a href="https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/measures-central-tendency-mean-mode-median.php#:~:text=As%20we%20will%20find%20out,for%20our%20data%20is%20skewed).">means get dragged “too high”</a> by massive outlier responses.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783c9357902c0f6b1232d_tF-vkHnzKyr_62evfU1M3yiJ72Uwx_hAzcFHDK8zgWMpsf-HmHKDyBFsn6LtJxI5n2IPz0GcFFzZXlU9gTszPO8Pub9a2eFbHxB8sctlOWSMpu73DsF3lejqTWrfwp90cCJflUFk.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight #7: iPhones were always pricey</h3><p>On that same note, the wisdom of the crowds is especially wise when it comes to smartphone prices. Back when the iPhone first launched in 2007, the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/12/iphone-prices-from-the-original-to-iphone-x/">price point of $499</a> was considered extremely high; this was back when Apple’s pet product was more of a luxury device and less of a world-conquering part of the global tech culture.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, <strong>when we took the median response from respondents, they were spot on: guessing $500 vs the actual price of $499.</strong><br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783ca8f37f3fe25638986_2fS6JLm5sE7AW7DId2Kz5DO7Y42cWvOpHsmjA5qYGnxaiQ4GLbq24Kpmccq--tIj9PgwW7TJY6U1O5gphqfP5VB4CiURHxchRXs1FhrEL5YROEPJd8dY7NEznb8zp-zm0WB5HEk9.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight #8: Tricky when not #23</h3><p>Michael Jordan was famously number 23 for the vast majority of his career, but there was a time in the 1994-95 season in which <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/why-michael-jordan-wore-no-45-out-retirement-and-why-he-went-back-no-23">he wore a different number</a>.

We loved that there were misspelled first names, misspelled last names, and misspelled both names.&nbsp;</p><p>While there’s been an incredible diversity of misspellings, we’re actually quite impressed that 95% of respondents have gotten the question correct (we accept misspellings as correct answers) and of those, nearly 60% actually did spell the famed aviator’s name correctly.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783cb6fee366ba95eb49c_1KgmnXF8uLR9PnWkV6zXVYfX5fjRlRtaDAuseLfAKA4SgkcutD56L28F-DjNO_HtU8GvqmbRPDyvagHnLPL4mRgAzU5NM4eYHeswEP4zozea25E78h7VPDyYsNr95K1MGrbCNXwP.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight 11: Near-homophones are very tricky</h3><p>The Sistine Chapel’s name comes from Pope Sixtus IV, who restored it between 1473 and 1481. But we didn’t expect participants to know the namesake of the famous home of <em>The Creation of Adam</em>. What we <em>didn’t</em> expect was the commonly-misheard and thusly mis-remembered name of this religious place.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>We saw </strong><a href="https://selectitaly.com/blog/rome/five-interesting-facts-about-the-sistine-chapel/"><strong>16th Chapel</strong></a><strong> and Sixtine Chapel pop up as responses nearly as frequently as Sistine Chapel.</strong> So if you want the world’s lamest party trick, ask someone you know where Michelangelo painted the ceiling and see if they’ve had the wrong name lodged in their head for years.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783cab278318f5f34c1fe_v0sNh2JbHmyzyP1CmQxIRJBvZTmjuvH_oM_HeLBMtoJFtJ158yhJjIUiK-dIgpB1uTXwZbdMjOBPTF8UxrmA_5YlyulPLBFvDutlPd3w_dFq40yvx8aHjp0YJ_PmySwRcJsPJ-ic.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight 12: Samuel Jackson has a unique lightsaber</h3><p>We can’t really phrase this one any better than the legendary <a href="https://screencrush.com/star-wars-samuel-l-jackson-purple-lightsaber/">Samuel L.

And I was like, well s---, I wanna be able to find myself in this big ol’ scene. So I said to George, 'You think maybe I can get a purple lightsaber?' "</strong></blockquote><p>Although Lucas pointed out that lightsabers traditionally only came in red or green, Jackson responded with some pretty powerful logic: </p><blockquote>‍<strong>"Yeah, but I want a purple one. I’m like the second baddest Jedi in the universe next to Yoda."</strong><br></blockquote><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783ca6f99dcacbf8d8fb5_3k4FPiSFe7-seRvpYfAM45bw9H0gU2Bh4S5qigjfGrFn-jL2freb7X-0fPDa8byWpKrhgScVPV2R8AZ8ZA9sGiNKQdMYBFBOm8MpSEi7diJNWFTnqggr-pZc7HvLm4d8XF5pBOWE.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight 13: Fridays aren’t productive for anyone</h3><p>We’ll admit that this question swayed a bit outside the typical guidelines for what is and isn’t included in trivia questions, but we thought it was a rich question for the office workers that comprise the vast majority of Water Cooler Trivia participants.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><div><p><strong>We weren’t too surprised that 0% of people knew Friday wouldn’t show up as HR Managers’ </strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=most+productive+day+of+the+week+hr+managers&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS879US879&amp;oq=most+productive+day+of+the+week+hr+managers&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5470j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><strong>perceived “most productive” day</strong></a><strong>, but the fact that over half of participants knew it was Tuesday was pretty mind-blowing.</strong> Maybe it’s because of all the Trivia Tuesday team building activities in the world...</p></div><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f0783cb90f705107dff2d74_G33rDWFpp1rxMLHlN-vBY3JxaSyff59S3cgv_LrUYP_4Q9jJtT01nPAzk9aG0bw_PL6wUhz7Tmr4MR1rMXW2JW0imbEffGdtN3wlKc1KlGxAy18psF8sYIjgbo_Q3SySoC6nyPCf.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Insight 14: Many different fruits can be dried and snacked on</h3><p>Confession: I wrote this question because I genuinely had no idea what fruit a prune came from.

<p>Let’s talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome#:~:text=Impostor%20syndrome%20(also%20known%20as,exposed%20as%20a%20%22fraud%22.">Impostor Syndrome</a>.</p>



<p>At some point in my software engineering/leadership career, it became evident that I was expected to have Impostor Syndrome. Indeed, it became clear that all underrepresented people in tech were expected to have Impostor Syndrome. I noticed this mostly in groups of women where especially the younger women would talk about “my Impostor Syndrome” as one would talk about “my arteries” or something else we just expect people to have. </p>



<p>I have a problem with this, and I’ll explain why. But first, a bit of context. I’ve been a woman in tech since the Dotcom Boom of the late ’90s. Throughout my career, I have been the only woman a lot: in meetings, on a whole floor of the office, in a codebase, on conference calls, at team lunches, you name it. As a Manager, then Director, and then VP of Engineering, I stood out even more. I’m currently the CTO of a startup, and a very small percentage of these roles are held by women. Despite that, I don’t have Impostor Syndrome. I’m confident that I bring a lot of qualifications to my job.</p>



<p>What I do have is what I like to think of as healthy self-doubt. There are plenty of gaps in my knowledge, but I’m confident that I can ask the right questions, figure out the solutions to problems, and understand what I need to learn. I’m confident that I can have gaps in my skillset because I can build awesome teams and rely on others to meet common goals. Where I can’t hire, I can learn. I don’t need to know everything or be everything to be successful. Does that mean I’ve never failed? Heck no! I’ve failed a bunch! So have all the people around me, regardless of demographics.</p>



<p>Healthy self-doubt is an important tool. It pushes me forward and keeps me from complacency. There’s no “resting on your laurels” in software careers. Success requires continued growth, evolution, and learning. Healthy self-doubt helps me know where to focus my efforts, it helps me prioritize. It helps me figure out when I’m in over my head so I can acknowledge that and then do something about it.</p>



<p>Impostor Syndrome, on the other hand, is really rough. I can only imagine what it must be like to worry that you’ll be uncovered as a fraud at any moment. If this is you, please know that I’m not trying to invalidate that in any way.</p>



<p>However, I believe that much of what we classify as Impostor Syndrome is actually healthy self-doubt and I would love for us to distinguish between the two. The danger with calling everything Impostor Syndrome is that it reinforces otherness. The word “impostor” reinforces the message that you do not belong here. </p>



<p>My point is this: if we expect everybody who is a little bit different to think of themselves as an impostor, we’ve totally lost the plot on this whole inclusion thing. Let’s add the notion of healthy self-doubt to the conversation so that we can distinguish between that which propels us forward and that which holds us back.</p>

<p>How to Start, Run, and Sell a Bootstrapped Business</p>







<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Welcome to <em>Zero to Sold</em>.</strong> This companion guide will introduce you to the world of bootstrapping a sustainable business. It will make you familiar with how bootstrapped enterprises are created, run, grown, and sold. It will guide you through all of the phases of a bootstrapped business, explaining key concepts and linking to articles on <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/">The Bootstrapped Founder</a> that dive deeper into each topic.</p>



<p>This is a living document. <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/contact/">Please reach out to me</a> if you find any errors, omissions, or falsehoods.</p>



<p>To get started, please begin with the <a href="#An_Introduction_to_Zero_to_Sold">Introduction</a> or use the table of contents to navigate to any section that you’re interested in.</p>



<p>The first sections will introduce you to bootstrapping in general and why I wrote Zero to Sold: my entrepreneurial journey with FeedbackPanda, from starting a bootstrapped business through running and growing it to $55.000 MRR, to finally selling FeedbackPanda just two years after founding.</p>



<p>The following sections are dealing with the four consecutive stages of a bootstrapped business: <a href="#The_Preparation_Stage">Preparation</a>, <a href="#The_Survival_Stage">Survival</a>, <a href="#The_Stability_Stage">Stability</a>, and <a href="#The_Growth_Stage">Growth</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, the last few sections will deal with the world beyond bootstrapping and provide you with further resources on the subject, as well as a bonus section on the many roles of a bootstrapped founder.</p>

<p>Many people dream of having a business that makes money for them while they sleep. Yet, most people never turn that dream into a reality. Life gets in the way, they say, and they aren’t cut out to be a business owner anyway.</p>



<p>I believe differently. I think that everyone can be an entrepreneur and create a sustainable business that will allow them to live a life of freedom and financial independence. It will require some sacrifice, as building a business will take a lot of work and time. But it will lead to a life of control, a life of choice, and a life of opportunity.</p>



<p><em>Zero to Sold</em> will show you what the life of a bootstrapped founder will look like. It will teach you how to fill all the roles required to run a business and what you need to get done in each stage of your bootstrapped company’s evolution.</p>



<p>No matter if you are just starting to think about being an entrepreneur, are in the middle of running a bootstrapped company, or are a seasoned founder, you will find useful strategies, thought-provoking anecdotes, and insightful concepts in this guide.</p>



<p>Every section will have a condensed paragraph containing the essential facts and ideas. If I’ve already written a specific article on the subject, it will be linked there using the 🔗symbol. If not, I will write it eventually and add the link later, so don’t hesitate to sign up for <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/newsletter/">The Bootstrapped Founder Newsletter</a>, where I announce new articles the week they’re published.</p>



<p>Please understand that while this is a guide, a manual, and a compendium, it won’t absolve you of taking responsibility for your own choices and actions. Carefully reflect if the experiences and bits of the advice laid out here apply to your business. In the end, you are the agent of your own success. Read and learn as much as you can, but treat all guidance and direction as anecdotal. You will have to find your own combination of strategies and tactics. <em>Zero to Sold</em> will help you get there.</p>







<h2><span id="The_FeedbackPanda_Story">The FeedbackPanda Story</span></h2>



<p>I wrote Zero to Sold because I’ve been through starting, running, and selling a bootstrapped business before. Within two years, I co-founded, ran, grew, and finally sold a Software-as-a-Service business called FeedbackPanda, a productivity tool for Online English teachers.</p>



<p>Of course, this wasn’t my first rodeo. I’ve been part of many internet businesses before, and I’ve had my fair share of failures. I was in businesses where we never finished building the product. I co-founded startups that fizzled out because we didn’t know how to market our service. I’ve been involved in companies that didn’t find a way to monetize their popular products, only to pivot to something completely different after many years of trying to make it work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll be sharing my experiences from both FeedbackPanda and the not-so-successful startups in this book, as I believe that you can learn the most at the intersection of experience and knowledge. So I will provide you with both.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the business that changed my life. Let’s take a look at FeedbackPanda, a service born out of necessity, a product that solved one critical problem for a well-defined audience, allowing me to experience and learn the things that I have compiled into this book.</p>



<p>FeedbackPanda was a collaborative effort between me and my girlfriend, Danielle Simpson, who was herself an Online English teacher at the time. We bootstrapped the business from day one, and when we sold it for what I would call a life-changing amount of money, the Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) of FeedbackPanda had just reached $55.000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within two years, we had built a niche service from a proof-of-concept into a thriving business that was attractive enough for a Private Equity firm to take it off our hands.</p>



<p>So, where did this all start?</p>



<p>It started with a leg injury. In early 2017, Danielle suffered an injury that meant she couldn’t leave the house for a while. For a trained Opera singer like her, that made regular work impossible. You can’t invite your audience into your living room for a concert.</p>



<p>So Danielle looked for work she could do from home, and she found something interesting. A wave of Chinese companies had emerged that recruited native English speakers to teach English as a second language to Chinese students. She tried it out and was hooked immediately: it was a fun job, it could be done using just a laptop, and the pay was alright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly after, she found that there were several large online communities of teachers who taught for various Chinese companies. Danielle joined those Facebook groups and forums and started hanging out with her virtual colleagues that numbered in the thousands at that point.</p>



<p>A few weeks into teaching on a full-time schedule, she noticed things that started as nuisances but quickly became painful problems. The teaching part of her job was great and fun, but certain formalities took way too much time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most noticeable problem was student feedback. After every 25-minute lesson, the teacher would have to write a few paragraphs of a lesson report that was supposed to inform the parents of what their child had learned, how well they learned it, and what they could practice at home. Having only five minutes between lessons to take care of this and everything else (ranging from grabbing a coffee to using the restroom), Danielle would defer this work until after she was done teaching for the day. It couldn’t be avoided, as the Chinese companies would not pay teachers for their teaching work unless the feedback was provided as well.</p>



<p>When Danielle started teaching 10-hour days, the added feedback time would often amount to almost two hours of unpaid overtime. That meant two hours less for spending time with me, meeting friends, or reading a good book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So she did what everyone would do: she developed a system, using Excel sheets and Word documents to track information about what her students learned, how they did, and what to suggest to their parents. She started using text templates for the content of the lesson and the preparation hints, as the Chinese schools defined the curriculum, and it would be the same for every student.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We found out that many other teachers did the same when they started talking about their self-built solutions in their online communities. Teachers began to share their templates through Google sheets. It was clear that this was a shared problem in a very tight-knit community.</p>



<p>One day, Danielle and I talked about the painful experience of student feedback, and how her system, even though it helped, was clunky and overwhelming. I looked into it, and it seemed quite possible to build a web-based application that would do this work faster and more reliably.</p>



<p>We also saw that this would be a great business opportunity. There was a sizeable market with an apparent, shared, and critical problem. The problem was solvable, but no-one had yet built anything to make it noticeably easier. So we decided to build a validation prototype, see if it had a meaningful impact on Danielle’s day-to-day workflow.</p>



<p>It took me a week or two to build the system. When Danielle finally started using it, it was clear as day: she transferred her loosely structured Excel and Word files into the system, and the automation kicked in immediately.</p>



<p>Instead of two hours of extra work a day, it would take her less than ten minutes altogether.</p>



<p>We knew we were onto something big from that very moment.</p>



<p>I had built the software with potentially turning it into a SaaS in mind. It had an authentication system built on Auth0 that would allow users to log in using their Facebook accounts, after all, that’s where we knew they hung out. It had a rudimentary subscription system build on Stripe that allowed us to charge from day one.</p>



<p>So we released it to the public, built a landing page, and waited. Nothing happened. One or two people signed up for the free trial, but there was not much else. We hadn’t done any marketing, and we hadn’t made any sales. The service just sat there, idling.</p>



<p>And then, one day, everything changed. In a comment to a Facebook post about how teachers dealt with feedback, Danielle dropped the link to our product …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

July 10, 2020 | https://blog.sulami.xyz/posts/atreus/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.sulami.xyz/posts/atreus/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>I recently received my early bird <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus">Keybardio Atreus</a><span><label for="sn-1"></label><span><img src="https://blog.sulami.xyz/images/atreus.jpg"> Promotional photo courtesy of Keyboardio</span></span> from <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/atreus/description">the Kickstarter</a> and have now been using it for about three weeks, so I am writing a review for folks considering buying one after release.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-history">A Bit of History</h2>
<p>Most of this is also outlined on the Atreus website, but here is the short version: my colleague Phil Hagelberg designed <a href="http://atreus.technomancy.us/">the original Atreus</a> keyboard in 2014, and has been selling kits for self-assembly ever since.</p>
<p>In 2019 Keyboardio, the company which created the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/the-model-01-an-heirloom-grade-keyboard-for-seriou">Model 01</a>, got together with Phil to build a pre-assembled commercial version of the Atreus. Their Kickstarter ran earlier in 2020 and collected almost $400k.</p>
<p>Phil’s original 42-key version can be built with either a PCB or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY2k75eWrLQ">completely hand-wired</a>, and uses a wooden, acrylic, or completely custom (e.g. 3D-printed) case.</p>
<p>Keyboardio split the two larger thumb keys into two regular size keys, bringing the total up to 44, and uses a PCB and Cherry MX-style switches mounted on an Aluminium plate inside a black ABS case.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>At a first impression, it is incredibly small<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Dimensions taking from the product page: 24.3 × 10 × 2.8cm, 310g.</span></span>, noticeably smaller still than the small <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english">Apple Magic Keyboard</a>. At the same time, it uses a regular key spacing, so once your hands are in place it does not feel cramped at all. On the contrary, every time I use a different keyboard now, I feel that half the keys are too far away to reach comfortably. It is also flat enough that I can use it without a wrist rest.</p>
<p>Mine has <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/3099/8088/files/CPG151101D213_Copper.pdf?11838687770053773851">Kailh Speed Copper</a> switches, which require 40g of force to actuate, with very early actuation points. They are somewhat comparable to <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/_Resources/Persistent/13618248706cd28e75ab9bdf9e55e9f8794611c1/EN_CHERRY_MX_BROWN.pdf">Cherry MX Browns</a> without the dead travel before the tactile bump. As mentioned above, the switches are mounted on an aluminium plate, and can be swapped without disassembly.</p>
<p>The early actuation point of the switches does require some getting used to, I keep experiencing some key chatter, especially on my weaker fingers, though Jesse from Keyboardio is working hard on alleviating that.</p>
<p>When it comes to noise, you can hear that it is a mechanical keyboard. Even with relatively quiet switches, the open construction means that the sound of the keys getting released is audible in most environments. I would hesitate to bring it to a public space, like a café or a co-working space. Open-office depends on the general noise level, and how tolerant your coworkers are, I have not had anyone complain about the sound level in video conferences.</p>
<p>The keycaps used are XDA-profile<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>Symmetrical and the same height across the keyboard, like lower profile SDA. That means you can rearrange them between rows.</span></span> laser-engraved PBT of medium thickness. Apparently there have been a lot of issues with the durability of the labels, so the specifics of that might change. I personally have had a single key start to fade a bit over 3 weeks of use, but I do not actually care.</p>
<p>The keyboard is powered by the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega32U4">ATmega32U4</a>, which is a pretty standard controller for a keyboard, it is also used in the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy 2.0</a> for example.</p>
<p>I would judge the overall build quality as good. While it does not feel like an ultra-premium product, there is nothing specific I can actually complain about, no rough edges or manufacturing artefacts.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>Out of the box, the keyboard uses the open-source <a href="https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a> firmware, which can be configured with the (also open-source) <a href="https://github.com/keyboardio/Chrysalis">Chrysalis</a> graphical configurator.<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span><img src="https://blog.sulami.xyz/images/chrysalis.png"> Chrysalis with my Layer 0</span></span> Supposedly it is also possible to use <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a>, and Phil has recently written <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/menelaus">Menelaus</a>, a firmware in <a href="https://ryansuchocki.github.io/microscheme/">Microscheme</a>.</p>
<p>I have stuck with (pre-release versions of) Kaleidoscope so far, which has worked out fairly well. Chrysalis is an Electron app, and doing sweeping changes in it can be a bit cumbersome compared to using text-based, declarative configuration, but it does the job. Flashing a new version onto the keyboard only takes a few seconds. I also have to mention the <a href="https://kaleidoscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">extensive documentation</a> available. Kaleidoscope has a rich plugin infrastructure, very little of which I actually use, but it does seem to rival QMK in flexibility.</p>
<p>I am using the Atreus with <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>, the same layout I have been using for almost a decade now, and compared to trying the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox</a>,<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>When I tried using an Ergodox for the first time, the ortholinear layout really threw me off, and I kept hitting right in between keys.</span></span> the switching was much smoother. I am mostly back to my regular typing speed of 80-90 WPM after three weeks, and I can still use a regular staggered layout keyboard without trouble.</p>
<p>The modifier keys at the bottom are unusual, but work for me. I use the three innermost keys with my thumbs, and the bottom edges by just pushing down with my palm. It does require some careful arrangement to avoid often having to press two modifiers on the same time at once.</p>
<p>With only 44 physical keys, the keyboard makes heavy use of layers, which can be temporarily shifted to when holding a key, or switched to permanently. By default the first extra layer has common special characters on the left half, and a numpad on the right, which works better than a regular keyboard for me.</p>
<p>The only problem I sometimes have is the lack of a status indicator. This means I have to keep track of the keyboard state in my head when switching layers. Not a big problem though.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My conclusion is quite simple: if you are in the market for a keyboard like this, this might be the keyboard for you. It does what it does well, and is much cheaper than anything comparable that does not require manual assembly. I personally enjoy the small form factor, the flexible (set of) firmware, and the RSI-friendly layout.</p>
<p>I also want to highlight the truly amazing effort Keyboardio puts into supporting their customers. You can browse the Kickstarter or their GitHub projects to see how much effort they put into this, and I have been in contact with Jesse myself while trying to debug a debouncing issue in the firmware. I am very happy to support them with my wallet.</p>

<![CDATA[Converting Linux kernel modules from C to Rust]]>

July 10, 2020 | https://immunant.com/blog/2020/06/kernel_modules/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://immunant.com/blog/2020/06/kernel_modules/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Earlier this year, we used the C2Rust framework to translate applications such as <a href="https://immunant.com/blog/2020/01/quake3">Quake 3</a> to Rust. In this post, we’ll show you that it is also possible to translate privileged software such as modules that are loaded by the Linux kenel. We’ll use a small, 3-file kernel module which is part of the <a href="https://github.com/Bareflank/hypervisor">Bareflank Hypervisor SDK</a> developed by <a href="https://ainfosec.com/">Assured Information Security</a> but you can use the same techniques to translate other kernel modules. The basic steps we’ll cover are:</p>
<ul>
<li>translating the C files into Rust,</li>
<li>compiling generated Rust, and</li>
<li>linking everything into a loadable kernel module.</li>
</ul>

<p>We transpiled the kernel module of Bareflank which consists of a small number
of C files: <code>common.c</code>, <code>entry.c</code> and <code>platform.c</code>. For the first step, we
needed to extract the kernel’s compilation flags and pass them to the
transpiler, so we would perfectly replicate the configuration settings and
macro expansions from the kernel build. We used the
<a href="https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear">Bear</a> tool to pseudo-build the original
kernel module and produce a <code>compile_commands.json</code> file containing the
compilation database:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd .../bareflank/bfdriver/src/platform/linux
$ make clean
$ bear make CC=clang
</code></pre>
<p>The kernel build system compiles C files differently (enabling or disabling
some language features) depending on the compiler used. Since the C2Rust
transpiler uses clang as its front-end, we had to use clang for the
pseudo-build as well. One complication we ran into were <em>asm gotos</em>, which are
a new extension to gcc’s inline assembly syntax that Linux started using in the
5.0 release, but were
<a href="https://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#linux-kernel">added</a>
to LLVM/clang in version 9.0. When we initially performed this experiment
(April 2019), that version of clang hadn’t come out so we were forced to revert
to an older 4.x kernel that did not use <em>asm gotos</em> just to get clang to parse
the C code. <em>Asm gotos</em> are now supported by clang, but the transpiler doesn’t
support them yet. We need to first investigate whether Rust’s inline assembly
(either the legacy version or the recently added
<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/06/08/new-inline-asm.html">redesign</a>)
even supports this feature right now.</p>
<p>After producing the compilation database, we transpiled the C files into Rust:</p>
<pre><code>$ # Remove compiler flags we can't handle
$ sed -i -e 's/"-Werror.*",//' ./compile_commands.json
$ c2rust transpile ./compile_commands.json --emit-no-std \
  --emit-modules -o bareflank-rs "<a href="https://immunant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="684c28">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"
</code></pre>
<p>After making some fixes and additions to C2Rust and fix the subsequent
compilation errors, we compiled the resulting Rust code with:</p>
<pre><code># cargo build --release --target x86_64-linux-kernel -Zbuild-std=core
</code></pre>
<p>We had originally used
<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild"><code>cargo-xbuild</code></a> to accomplish
this without support from the Rust compiler, but the Rust team  added the
kernel module target to Cargo at the end of August 2019. Once that happened,
we could use <code>cargo build</code> directly to build our kernel module.</p>
<p>We had to make a few minor manual changes to the Rust files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Replace <code>use libc;</code> with <code>use crate::libc;</code> since we had some problems
using the libc crate from crates.io inside a kernel module. C2Rust uses the
basic C type definitions from this crate, and we had to redefine them manually.
This might not be a problem anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manually remove a couple of duplicate <code>current_stack_pointer</code> definitions.
This variable is defined in a header in C and the transpiler emits it in
every transpiled <code>.rs</code> file as <code>#[no_mangle]</code>, which causes Rust linking errors. We
had to manually remove all but one definitions of this symbol (the symbol
wasn’t even used anywhere, so we could have removed all of them, but didn’t
need to).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all the fixes were in, we successfully compiled the module but still had
to fix a couple of issues. First, Cargo produces a static library called
<code>libbareflank_rs.a</code>, but the kernel build system only supports object files and
not static libraries. We turned the static library into an object file by
calling the system linker from our kernel module <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$(M)/libbareflank_rs.o: target/x86_64-linux-kernel/release/bareflank_rs.a
        $(LD) -r -o <a href="https://immunant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="684c28">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> --whole-archive $^
</code></pre>
<p>The second issue was that we were initially also transpiling the
<code>bareflank.mod.c</code> file that the kernel build system auto-generates from the input
object files. We were producing a <code>libbareflank_rs.o</code> that already included
a transpiled copy of this auto-generated file,
then passing that to the kernel build system that would produce a second
<code>bareflank.mod.c</code> and link that together with <code>libbareflank_rs.o</code> to produce
<code>bareflank.ko</code>. Having two copies of the contents of <code>bareflank.mod.c</code> was
causing crashes.  Once we removed the transpiled <code>bareflank.mod.rs</code> file from the build,
the kernel module loaded and ran successfully.</p>

<p>We encountered many C features and gcc-specific extensions that the kernel
headers use and we had to add to C2Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A series of gcc attributes: <code>inline</code>, <code>cold</code>, <code>alias</code>, <code>used</code>, <code>section</code>
and more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updates to the C2Rust bitfields crate: support for <code>no_std</code> and booleans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gcc intrinsic used by some kernel memory functions: <code>__builtin_object_size</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inline assembly support in C2Rust for memory-only, read-write and early-clobber
operands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structures that are both packed and aligned, mainly
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/arch/x86/include/asm/fpu/types.h#L253"><code>xregs_state</code></a>.
This particular combination is not currently supported in Rust, so we had
to implement a work-around in C2Rust by emitting a pair of nested
structures (aligned outer structure, packed inner structure) instead:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>#[repr(C, align(64))]
pub struct xregs_state(pub xregs_state_Inner);
#[repr(C, packed)]
pub struct xregs_state_Inner {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>All of these issues have been implemented in C2Rust and should work for all
kernel modules, but different modules may expose new unimplemented C features.</p>

<p>C2Rust maps C types to their definitions in the libc crate, but we were
unable (at the time) to use this crate in our kernel module. Instead, we
redefined some of its types manually:</p>
<pre><code>pub mod libc {
    pub type c_char = i8;
    pub type c_schar = i8;
    pub type c_ulong = u64;
    pub type c_uint = u32;
    // ...all the others
}
</code></pre>
<p>(The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cty"><code>cty</code></a> crate also provides the necessary type aliases<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.)</p>
<p>We also had to implement a couple of libc functions that the compiler relies on:</p>
<pre><code>pub unsafe fn memset(s: *mut c_void, c: c_int, n: size_t) -&gt; *mut c_void {
    core::ptr::write_bytes(s as *mut u8, c as u8, n as usize);
    s
}

pub unsafe fn memcpy(dest: *mut c_void, src: *const c_void, n: size_t) -&gt; *mut c_void {
    core::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(src as *const u8, dest as *mut u8, n as usize);
    dest
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we added stubs for a few missing kernel functions, and for the Rust
panic handler (we decided to implement it properly at a later date):</p>
<pre><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn __bad_size_call_parameter() -&gt; ! {
    unreachable!("__bad_size_call_parameter")
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn __bad_percpu_size() -&gt; ! {
    unreachable!("__bad_percpu_size")
}

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &amp;PanicInfo) -&gt; ! {
    // FIXME: call into the kernel
    loop {}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The main remaining “ugliness” is that the transpiler fully expands C macros, so
the transpiled code is not always pleasant to look at:</p>
<pre><code>   match ::core::mem::size_of::&lt;libc::c_int&gt;() as libc::c_ulong {
	1 =&gt; {
	    pscr_ret__ = ({
		let mut pfo_ret__: libc::c_int = 0;
		match ::core::mem::size_of::&lt;libc::c_int&gt;() as libc::c_ulong {
		    1 =&gt; asm!("movb %gs:$1,$0" :
					       "=q" (pfo_ret__) :
					       "*m" (&amp;cpu_number)
					       : : "volatile"),
		    2 =&gt; asm!("movw %gs:$1,$0" :
					       "=r" (pfo_ret__) :
					       "*m" (&amp;cpu_number)
					       : : "volatile"),
		    4 =&gt; asm!("movl %gs:$1,$0" :
					       "=r" (pfo_ret__) :
					       "*m" (&amp;cpu_number)
					       : : "volatile"),
		    8 =&gt; asm!("movq %gs:$1,$0" :
					       "=r" (pfo_ret__) :
					       "*m" (&amp;cpu_number)
					       : : "volatile"),
		    _ =&gt; {
			__bad_percpu_size();
		    }
		}
		pfo_ret__
	    })
	}
</code></pre>
<p>C2Rust uses clang as a front-end which currently expands macros very early before parsing,
so modifying it to produce an AST with unexpanded macros would be a significant undertaking.
We are currently considering other alternatives, but it is unclear whether any
of them would be simpler. For the foreseeable future, C2Rust will
not be able to transpile non-trivial function-like C macros to Rust macros.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content"><p>When imitating a real world circuit in the digital world, it is important to consider the quirks and constraints present in hardware components. This article is looking at how a software application can mimic the effects on a signal of an operational amplifier when it reaches saturation.</p><p>The incredibly versatile Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) has many flaws and caveats that have to be considered in circuit design. When software aims to mimic a hardware design, these imperfections should be considered, and replicated as desired.</p><p>In an ideal world, Operational Amplifiers would be able to output any arbitrary voltages, but in reality they are constrained by their power supply. The peak-to-peak voltage of the outputted signal cannot go higher than the voltage of the power rails; this is called Saturation. In older op-amps, the peak-to-peak voltage of the output signal would be several volts less than the power supplyâ€™s peak-to-peak voltage, though newer op-amps can get closer to the power supply.</p><p>When looking at the datasheet of an Op-Amp, youâ€™ll often see a graph that resembles something like this:</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-ideal-saturation.png" alt="The kind of Op-Amp saturation graph you see in a datasheet or in education."> <em>The kind of Op-Amp saturation graph you see in a datasheet or in education.</em></p><p>This characteristic can be represented like this:</p><p> $$ f(x)=\begin{cases} n &amp;: x \times g \leq n &amp;\text{(negative saturation)}\\ x \times g &amp;: n &lt; x \times g &lt; p &amp;\text{(active/linear region)}\\ p &amp;: x \times g \geq p &amp;\text{(positive saturation)}\\ \end{cases} $$</p><p>where\( \; n = \text{negative saturation voltage}\),\( \; p = \text{positive saturation voltage}\),\( \; x = \text{input signal}\),\( \; g = \text{gain}\).</p><p>In other words, the output of the op-amp is linear in regards to the input whilst between the two saturation thresholds, though once it goes above or below the positive or negative saturation levels, the output matches the saturation level.</p><p>This is an idealised version of a non-ideal op-amp, which is a strange concept. Real Op-Amp saturation doesnâ€™t look like that, nor does an idealised Op-Amp (which wouldnâ€™t saturate at all). This idealised version would be easy for us to simulate without doing any complicated calculation; simply clip at the saturation thresholds.</p><p>In reality, an op-amp has a slight curve as it nears saturation, and it becomes non-linear, similar to the below (which is a little exaggerated):</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-real-saturation.png" alt="A slightly more realistic graph of Op-Amp saturation."> <em>A slightly more realistic graph of Op-Amp saturation.</em></p><p>This is the characteristic that Iâ€™d like to imitate.</p><p>We can tell just by looking at it that it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">Sigmoid Function</a> (aka any function with an â€˜Sâ€™ shape.)</p><p>Iâ€™m not an expert mathematician, so Iâ€™ll often do a bit of trial and error with Wolfram Alpha to see if I can nudge an equation closer to what Iâ€™m looking for.</p><p>I eventually turned my attention to the given algebraic function:</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-wiki.png" alt="The graph of the function for n=2, plotted by Wolfram Alpha."> <em>The graph of \(y = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\), plotted by Wolfram Alpha.</em></p><p>It has a fairly lacklustre performance characteristic as written; there is almost no linear region. However, I noticed that if I generalised the formula (ie to the formula below), then as n increased, the characteristic became more like the idealised op-amp saturation characteristic.</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-wiki-modified.png" alt="The graph of the function for n=100, plotted by Wolfram Alpha."> <em>The graph of \(y = \frac{x}{\sqrt[100]{1+x^{100}}}\), plotted by Wolfram Alpha.</em></p><p>The graph above is for \(n = 100\). When I differentiated this function, I saw that yes, the â€˜linear regionâ€™ was actually linear (and not some imperceptible curve):</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-wiki-modified-differentiated.png" alt="The graph of the differential of the function for n=100, plotted by Wolfram Alpha."> <em>First order differential of \(y = \frac{x}{\sqrt[100]{1+x^{100}}}\), plotted by Wolfram Alpha.</em></p><p>I played with the numbers and ended up settling with \(n = 100\). It seemed like a good medium between â€˜not doing anythingâ€™ and â€˜doing too muchâ€™. If I really wanted to I could measure it on an oscilloscope and try to match it exactly, but for me this was good enough.</p><p><img src="https://jetholt.com/assets/images/micro/op-amp-final.png" alt="The graph of the function for n=20, plotted by Wolfram Alpha."> <em>The graph of \(y = \frac{x}{\sqrt[20]{1+x^{20}}}\), plotted by Wolfram Alpha.</em></p><p>To use this in your code, simply rescale your input signal so that the thresholds fall at -1 and 1, pass the rescaled signal through the function (as \(x\)), and then scale back up.</p><p>I did this for a C++ project, so my code looks like this:</p><div><div><pre><code>float saturate(float input, float threshold) {
    float scale = input / threshold;
    return (threshold * scale) / (std::pow(1.f + std::pow(scale,20.f), 1.f/20.f));
}
</code></pre></div></div></div><p id="calltoaction"><em>P.S. I'm late to the party, but I recently got <a href="https://twitter.com/JetroidMakes">a twitter account</a> that you can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=JetroidMakes">here</a>.</em></p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Update [2020-07-11]: Due to some feedback on Hackernews about cold-starts, I went ahead and updated the Deno deployment so that it
didn't download dependencies at the start. Please see the <a href="#cold-starts-and-deno">Cold Starts and Deno</a> below. </p>
<p><a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> is hot. Aimed to solve some
    of the more painful aspects of Node, Deno has taken the community by storm and a lot
    of people are looking to replace their Node-based workloads.</p>
<p>For me, I mostly use Node for Lambda functions. 
I wanted to see if Deno could replace it. 
Since Deno has a totally different packaging system that means that I have to wait until AWS clients are written or 
write them myself. 
There is a Deno library for <a href="https://deno.land/x/dynamodb">DynamoDB</a>, though.
Combine that with the <a href="https://github.com/hayd/deno-lambda">Lambda Layer</a> that has been created for the community and 
you I could get started easily enough. But, is it good?</p>
<p>Mainly, is it performant? I started by setting up two Lambda functions, one written for Node and one written for Deno.
Each function did the same thing, wrote a DynamoDB record and then read it back. I created a third Lambda, written for 
Node, that would execute the other two Lambdas at a specified rate. I'd then monitor performance.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Let's get this out of the way: Node and the AWS SDK are optimized. They've been around for quite a while and have gotten
quite good, as you will soon see. Deno and the library used here have probably not undergone the same level of optimization.
That being said, I still wanted to find out if it's worth adopting right now.</p>
<h2 id="the-test">The Test</h2>
<p>I ran the tester Lambda, asking for 5 minutes of calls every 500ms. I assumed that this would allow the runtimes to 'settle' 
after the cold-start and I could see representative duration metrics. This was my primary concern: <strong>what's the p99 duration
of the Lambda function execution</strong>.</p>
<p>The results are largely what I expected:</p>
<p><img src="https://matthewbonig.com/posts/images/node-vs-deno/results.png" alt="Duration Comparisons"></p>
<p>The Node lambda would execute around 40ms, which is quite solid. This was with the 
<strong><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/node-reusing-connections.html">AWS_NODEJS_CONNECTION_REUSE_ENABLED</a></strong>
environment variable. Init durations were around 350ms. Increasing memory to 1024 didn't improve either metric signficanly.</p>
<p>The Deno lambda averaged a <strong>250ms</strong> duration. Worse, the init durations were in the <strong>3.5s</strong> range. The main reason for 
this is the Deno runtime currently downloads external packages on cold-start. There are probably some mechanisms to speed 
this up, but that's for another post. </p>

<p>So, obviously, this is bad. Getting a 6x increase in moving from Node to Deno is not real appealing.  But, does this 
mean Deno shouldn't be adopted?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-thoughts">Conclusion and Thoughts</h2>
<p>Deno is hot. And for good reason. If you've ever worked with Node and the <code>node_modules</code> directory you've probably
dealt with a packaging system that has a lot to be desired. Additionally, it's pretty insecure by default, allowing any
codebase full access to the file system and network. This has been a 
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-spots-malicious-npm-package-stealing-data-from-unix-systems/">recurring</a>
<a href="https://snyk.io/blog/malicious-code-found-in-npm-package-event-stream/">problem</a>, usually requiring tools and diligent
maintainers to catch problems after they've occurred. Deno aimed to solve both of these problems with a de-centralized
package ecosystem and a safe-by-default runtime, requiring 
<a href="https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/permissions">explicit parameters</a>
to enable access to the network and file system. Oh, and let's not forget 1st class 
<a href="https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/typescript">Typescript support</a>!</p>
<p>So, with these numbers, is Deno ready? For API Gateway integration, I'd say no. The cold-start and runtime performance
just isn't there yet for backing client-facing API calls. But, what about other situations? Backing API Gateway isn't the
only use-case for Deno. In a lot of cases Lambda functions are used for listening to event streams, responding to Step
Function calls, or just a nightly background data processing process. In those cases, having a slower runtime may not be
an issue (other than the additional billing costs). And, this is where a microservice architecture and highly decoupled
systems really shines. You could easily adopt Deno for a few functions that don't need low latency; get used to the runtime
and flesh out your development pipeline around it with low risk to your overall project (if it doesn't work, it's hopefully
small enough you can just re-implement with Node).</p>
<p>Personally, I'm really excited about Deno. Node has baggage and some of that baggage is not easy to carry. It took 
years before Node was ready for production and adopted in those environments. Thanks to a vastly different landscape
now, I think Deno will be in production much quicker. As such, jump in now where you can and get used to it, cause if you're
running Node now I'm willing to bet you'll be running Deno in some capacity in 2 years.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Btw, if you'd like the code so you can run these tests yourself, they're available <a href="https://github.com/mbonig/node-vs-deno">here</a>,
as (what else?!) a CDK module.</p>
<h2 id="cold-starts-and-deno">Cold Starts and Deno</h2>
<p>Someone posted this blog to Hackernews and many comments were around not bundling the dependencies. So, I went back and
bundled them. The results are a little bit shocking.</p>
<p>First, here is an example of the logs of a cold-start without bundling:</p>

      <section id="main_content">
        
<p>Hello chaps, I am the QuanticDev, a senior software engineer. I have started my development career with Windows back in middle school. I mostly did PHP back then, along with some basic C/C++ using Borland C++ Builder 6, and it worked out great! However, since then, Windows became the underdog of software development. With the power of free and open-source software, Linux has taken over the server world. The easiest way to write server-side apps that target Linux is to use a Unix based system like macOS or Linux, and not Windows! In addition, Windows never had a great package manager. There were attempts like Chocolatey or Scoop, but they are no match to Homebrew on macOS or tens of different package managers found on Linux systems. Now that we have the second version of Windows Subsystem for Linux, as well as the shiny new Windows Package Manager called “winget”, did the tables turn? Let’s find out.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>You can find the video narration of this article on YouTube: Part #1 - GitHub Advantages, Alternatives, and Setup: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnHGGmLMKO0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnHGGmLMKO0</a></p>

</ul>

<p>My separate <a href="https://quanticdev.com/articles/manjaro-linux-productivity-machine" target="_blank">Cleanest Linux Productivity and Development Environment using Manjaro Linux</a> article also referred to in this article.</p>

<h2 id="windows-package-manager-winget">Windows Package Manager (winget)</h2>
<p><strong>Tip: Next two section are transcripts from my live demonstrations of them. If you want to watch it, the link to the video is in resources section above.</strong></p>

<p>Before anything, you might remember that in my “Cleanest Linux Productivity and Development Environment using Manjaro Linux” article, I heavily criticized Window for not having a native package manager and not having access to essential utilities like Bash and other Unix tools. Now that Windows 10 May 2020 update is out, we can test and see if the situation is better. So, let’s start by installing the new Windows Package Manager; winget. It is open-source and is hosted on GitHub, so I will head over to its GitHub page. It appears that the future versions of Windows will have it pre-installed, but for now, I will manually install it. Once the installation is done, I will search for some developer tools to install. I’ll start by searching for Node.js. Searching for packages is easy but installing them is a bit quirky. You need to use the package ID instead of the package name. Once the Node.js package is installed, you will be greeted by the next quirk. The “node” command will not be available in your current PowerShell window. You will have to close it and open a new one to get “node” command to work.</p>

<p>Now let’s go ahead and check if all the essential packages necessary for development are available in winget repositories. Go programming language is there. Python 3.8 is also in the repos. But I realize that they only have the latest versions and not the older but still supported ones. This is a deal-breaker for me since my projects routinely depend on certain versions of programming language tools. If winget does not add this feature, I would have to maintain versions manually.</p>

<p>I can also see that Chrome, DropBox, and Firefox are also in the winget repos. However, I cannot find IntelliJ, which is one of my favorite code editors. The winget GitHub page has a link to “winget-pkgs” repo which contains all current and candidate winget packages. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/179" target="_blank">I can see that there is a discussion going on in the issue tracker to add IntelliJ to the repos</a>, which is good. There seems to be a ton of activity in winget-pkgs repo which means there are a ton of new packages added daily, and many other being updated.</p>

<h2 id="windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-wsl-2">Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2)</h2>
<p>Now that we investigated the new Windows Package Manager, I want to test the new Windows Subsystem for Linux, version 2. I will simply follow the command line instructions from WSL 2 website. It comes with an updated Linux kernel and has a bunch of other improvements. There is an open-source project on GitHub to bring Arch Linux to WSL, so I will go ahead and install it. Arch and Arch-based Manjaro Linux are my favorite Linux distros, so having direct access to them from Windows is a major stepping stone for me. WSL 2 uses a highly optimized virtualization engine with Hyper-V. WSL 2 boots to the Arch command line in less than a second on my machine! We seem to be the root user in the terminal so let’s go ahead and install Node.js and npm so that we can compare the package installation process with Windows. The installation is quick. It seems that file system performance is near-native. This is a huge improvement over WSL version 1.</p>

<p>We have all our development tools ready both in Arch Linux Subsystem and on our host Windows system. I will go ahead and clone my open-source “js-api” project from my GitHub account to this machine. Once it is cloned, I will do “npm install” to install all missing packages and start my js-api server using “npm start”. Thanks to having a fast SSD, everything is decently quick and seems to work well. I will repeat the same task on Arch, but with one of my even bigger (however unmaintained) open-source projects: KOAN.js. This project has both frontend and backend packages, so if there is any slowness in I/O operations, we should observe it. Even with substantially more dependencies, “npm install” is again as quick as it was on Windows. This tells me that both disk and network performance are near-native inside WSL 2 virtual machines.</p>

<h2 id="downsides-of-wsl-and-winget">Downsides of WSL and winget</h2>
<p>Even though winget in combination with WSL 2 + Arch is looking good, it is not all sunshine and rainbows. First off, winget does not have dependency management. This means that it just downloads and executes .exe files. Though dependency management is on their roadmap.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/is-windows-good-for-developers/images/winget-dependency-management.png" alt="winget Dependency Management"></p>

<p>In addition, you can only find the latest versions of packages, and not the older stable ones. This might be a deal-breaker for many developers that want to pin their systems to specific versions of development tools.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/is-windows-good-for-developers/images/winget-package-versions.png" alt="winget Package Versions"></p>

<p>In addition, WSL’s distro selection is very limited. Though, WSL 2 switched to a fully flagged virtual machine approach, so I assume that the situation will improve over time.</p>

<h2 id="is-window-with-wsl-2-and-winget-a-worthy-developer-os">Is Window with WSL 2 and winget a Worthy Developer OS?</h2>
<p>The answer is: not yet, but we are getting there. Both the new package manager and Linux subsystem are missing important functionality. But their roadmaps look bright. I understand that developers that are moving towards the business management side of things need Windows, mostly due to the business world’s dependency on Microsoft Office. If you are on that boat, I would say investing in a Windows laptop and doing occasional programming on it using the Linux subsystem is an acceptable compromise. If you do not need the full Microsoft Office experience on native Windows, I still strongly recommend Manjaro Linux. Both for general productivity tasks and software development, it offers a near-perfect experience. If you want to check my dedicated article on it, the link is in the resources section above.</p>

<p>And that is about it for now. If there are worthy updates to WSL and winget in the future, I will review them again and write an updated article. I am planning to buy a compact Windows machine, maybe an Asus PN50 Mini PC with AMD Ryzen 7 4700U, to use it as my Premiere renderer machine. If I get one, I will set up QEMU + Arch Linux and compare it to WSL 2 workflow and let you guys know. If you want to check out the updates, you can follow me on Twitter or on YouTube.</p>

July 10, 2020 | https://microtica.com/the-concept-of-domain-driven-design-explained/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://microtica.com/the-concept-of-domain-driven-design-explained/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/">microservices</a> means <strong>creating applications from loosely coupling services</strong>. The application consists of several small services, each representing a separate business goal. <a href="https://microtica.com/deploy-your-first-microservice-on-kubernetes-in-10-mins/">They can be developed and easily maintained individually</a>, after what they are joint in a complex application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microservices is an architecture design model with a <strong>specific bounded context, configuration, and dependencies. </strong>These result from the architectural principles of the domain-driven design and DevOps. <strong>Domain-driven design is the idea of solving problems of the organization through code.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The business goal is important to the business users, with a <strong>clear interface and functions</strong>. This way, the microservice can run independently from other microservices. Moreover, the team can also work on it independently, which is, in fact, the point of the microservice architecture.</p>



<p>Many developers claim microservices have made them more efficient. This is due to the ability to work in small teams. This allows them to develop different small parts that will later be merged as a large app. </p>



<p>They spend less time coordinating with other developers and more time on developing the actual code. Eventually, this creates more value for the end-user.</p>



<h2>The Complexity Challenge</h2>



<p>Complexity is a relative term. What’s complex for one person is simple for another. However, <strong>complexity is the problem that domain-driven design should solve</strong>. In this context, complexity means interconnectedness, many different data sources, different business goals, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The domain-driven approach is here to solve the complexity of software development. On the other hand, you can use emergent design when the challenge is simple. However, when your application is complex, the complexity will only grow, and so will your problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Domain-driven design bases on the business domain. </strong>Modern business environments are very complex and wrong moves can lead to fatal outcomes. Domain-driven design solves complex domain models, connecting to the core business concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eric Evans, introduced the concept in 2004, in his book <em>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</em>. According to the book, it focuses on three principles:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The primary focus of the project is the core <strong>domain </strong>and <strong>domain logic.</strong></li><li>Complex designs are based on <strong>models of the domain.</strong></li><li>Collaboration between technical and <strong>domain experts </strong>is crucial to creating an application model that will solve particular domain problems.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Important terms in Domain-Driven Design</h2>



<p>In DDD, it’s important to pay attention to the following terms:&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Domain logic</h4>



<p>Domain logic<strong> </strong>is <strong>the purpose of your modeling</strong>. Most commonly, it’s referred to as the <strong>business logic. </strong>This is where your business rules define the way data gets created, stored, and modified.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Domain model</h4>



<p>Domain model includes the <strong>ideas, knowledge, data, metrics, and goals</strong> that revolve around that problem you’re trying to solve. It contains all the rules and patterns that will help you deal with complex business logic. Moreover, they will be useful to meet the requirements of your business.</p>



<h4>Subdomain</h4>



<p>A domain consists of several subdomains<strong> </strong>that refer to <strong>different parts of the business logic</strong>. For example, an online retail store could have a product catalog, inventory, and delivery as its subdomains.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Design patterns</h4>



<p>Design patterns<strong> </strong>are all about <strong>reusing code</strong>. No matter the complexity of the problem you encounter, someone who’s been doing object-oriented programming has probably already created a pattern that will help you solve it. Breaking down your problem into its initial elements will lead you to its solution. Everything you learn through patterns, you can later use for any object-oriented language you start to program in.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Bounded context</h4>



<p>Bounded context is a <strong>central pattern</strong> in domain-driven design that contains the complexity of the application. It handles large models and teams. This is where you implement the code, after you’ve defined the <strong>domain </strong>and the <strong>subdomains.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Bounded contexts actually represent <strong>boundaries in which a certain subdomain is defined and applicable.</strong> Here, the specific subdomain makes sense, while others don’t. One entity can have different names in different contexts. When a subdomain within the bounded context changes, the entire system doesn’t have to change too. That’s why developers use adapters between contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>The Ubiquitous Language</h4>



<p>The Ubiquitous Language is a methodology that refers to <strong>the same language domain experts and developers use when they talk about the domain they are working on.</strong> This is necessary because projects can face serious issues with a disrupted language. This happens because domain experts use their own jargon. At the same time, tech professionals use their own terms to talk about the domain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a gap between the terminology used in daily discussions and the terms used in the code. That’s why it’s necessary to define a set of terms that everyone uses. All the terms in the ubiquitous language are structured around the domain model.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Entities</h4>



<p>Entities are a combination of <strong>data and behavior</strong>, like a user or a product. They have identity, but represent data points with behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Value objects and aggregates</h4>



<p>Value objects <strong>have attributes</strong>, but can’t exist on their own. For example, the shipping address can be a value object. Large and complicated systems have countless entities and value objects. That’s why the domain model needs some kind of structure. This will put them into logical groups that will be easier to manage. These groups are called <strong>aggregates. </strong>They represent a collection of objects that are connected to each other, with the goal to treat them as units. Moreover, they also have an <strong>aggregate root. </strong>This is the only entity that any object outside of the aggregate can reference to.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Domain service</h4>



<p>The domain service is <strong>an additional layer that also contains domain logic</strong>.  It’s part of the domain model, just like entities and value objects. At the same time, the <strong>application service </strong>is another layer that doesn’t contain business logic. However, it’s here to coordinate the activity of the application, placed above the domain model.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Repository</h4>



<p>The repository pattern is a <strong>collection of business entities</strong> that simplifies the data infrastructure. It releases the domain model from infrastructure concerns. The <strong>layering </strong>concept enforces the separation of concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Example of Domain-Driven Design</h2>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-1024x549.png" alt="Example of domain-driven design" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-1024x549.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-300x161.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-768x411.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01-740x396.png 740w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topac-01.png 1400w" sizes="100vw"></figure>



<p>If we take an e-commerce app, for example, the business domain would be to process an order. When a customer wants to place an order, they first need to go through the products. Then, they choose their desired ones, confirm the order, choose shipping type, and pay. The app then processes the data the client provides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, a user app would consist of the following layers:&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>User Interface</strong></h4>



<p>This is where the customer can find <strong>all the information needed to place an order</strong>. In an e-commerce case, this is where the products are. This layer presents the information to the client and interprets their actions.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Application layer</strong></h4>



<p>This layer doesn’t contain business logic. It’s the part that <strong>leads the user from one to another UI screen</strong>. It also interacts with application layers of other systems. It can perform simple validation but it contains no domain-related logic or data access. Its purpose is to organize and delegate domain objects to do their job. Moreover, it’s the only layer accessible to other bounded contexts.</p>



<h4><strong>Domain layer</strong></h4>



<p>This is where the <strong>concepts of the business domain </strong>are. This layer has all the information about the business case and the business rules. Here’s where the <strong>entities </strong>are. As we mentioned earlier, entities<strong> </strong>are a combination of data and behavior, like a user or a product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have a unique identity guaranteed via a unique key and remains even when their attributes change. For example, in an e-commerce store, every order has a unique identifier. It has to go through several actions like confirming and shipping to be considered as an entity.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong>value objects</strong> don’t have unique identifiers. They represent attributes that various entities can share. For example, this could be the same last name of different customers.</p>



<p>This part also contains services with <strong>defined operational behavior</strong> that don’t have to be a part of any domain. However, they are still part of the business domain. The services are named according to the ubiquitous language. They shouldn’t deprive entities and value objects of their clear accountability and actions. Customers should be able to use any given service instance. The history of that instance during the lifetime of the application shouldn’t be a problem.</p>



<p>Most importantly, the domain layer is in the center of the business application. This means that it should be separated from the rest of the layers. It shouldn’t depend on the other layers or their frameworks.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Infrastructure layer</strong></h4>



<p>This layer <strong>supports communication between other layers</strong> and can contain supporting libraries for the UI layer.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Advantages of Domain-Driven Design</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Simpler communication. </strong>Thanks to the Ubiquitous  Language, communication between developers and teams becomes much easier. As the ubiquitous language is likely to contain simpler terms developers refer to, there’s no need for complicated technical terms.</li><li><strong>More flexibility. </strong>As DDD is object-oriented, everything about the domain is based on and object is modular and caged. Thanks to this, the entire system can be modified and improved regularly.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The domain is more important than UI/UX. </strong>As the domain is the central concept, developers will build applications suited for the particular domain.  This won’t be another interface-focused application. Although you shouldn’t leave out UX, using the DDD approach means that the product targets exactly the users that are directly connected to the domain.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I recently published a warts-and-all 4 part introduction (covering <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2019/09/20/graph-fundamentals-part-1-rdf/">RDF</a>, <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2019/09/25/graph-fundamentals-part-2-labelled-property-graphs/">Property Graphs</a>, <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2020/02/25/graph-fundamentals-part-4-linked-data/">Graph Schemas</a> and <a href="https://terminusdb.com/2020/02/25/graph-fundamentals-part-4-linked-data/">Linked Data</a>). You would be forgiven for concluding that I am not a fan of Graph databases or RDF. One reader on Twitter even accused me of “shitting on RDF”(!).</p>

<p>It’s important to be frank about the problems of graphs and RDF and not just whistle the marketing tune because as soon as the technology is out there in the hands of developers, they <em>will</em> find the problems and will be inclined to reject the technology as pure hype if all they have heard are songs of breathless wonder. In the last couple of years, while trying to sell graph databases into bricks and mortar companies, by far the most hostile reactions I’ve come across have been from technologists who got bitten by the Semantic Web bug in the early 2000s. Once bitten twice shy.</p>

<p>However, if you were to assume that I’m a critic of graph databases, you would be very wrong. I’ve spent most of the last decade building graph database management systems because to me it’s incredibly obvious that in the long run graph is going to win and here’s why.</p>

<hr>

<p>The point of all databases is to provide as accurate a representation of some aspect of external reality as possible.</p>

<p>The fundamental advantage of graph databases is that they model the world as things that have properties and relationships with other things.</p>

<p>This is closer to the way that humans perceive the world — mapping between whatever aspect of external reality you are interested in and the data model is an order of magnitude easier than with relational databases. Everything is pre-joined — you don’t have to disassemble objects into normalised tables and reassemble them with joins.</p>

<p>And because creating and curating large and complex datasets is very difficult, very expensive and potentially very lucrative, the reduction in technical complexity in creating and interpreting the graph data model is irresistible. The knowledge graphs that companies like Google and Facebook have accumulated are demonstrably commercially powerful and it is unlikely that such complex and rich datasets would have been possible without graph.</p>

<p>Humans have an evolutionarily pragmatic view of the world. We perceive the world as things that move through space and time. These things have properties which may change over time. They also have relationships with other things which may also change over time.</p>

<p>The model is simple but there are a great many different types of things — from stones, to mirrors to politicians and honeybees. To make sense of these things and their properties, we organise them into types and organise these types into a ‘tree-of-life’ or more broadly a ‘tree-of-things’ —taxonomies of types of things that share certain properties and relationships with other types of things.</p>

<p>Whether you are building a database to record the known universe or logging network security incidents, the model that you actually want to record is always a bunch of objects, categorised with a type-taxonomy, with properties and relationships with other objects, some of which change over time. That’s what you always want to record, because that’s how you perceive the world. Any indirection between perceived world and recorded model creates extra complexity at every step of processing. And in the world of complex systems, combinatorial explosion of complexity is the one true enemy. Reducing the complexity in each and every data operation is irresistible in the long run — you can focus on other things rather than the mappings between the aspects of the real world that you want to model and their stored representations.</p>

<p>In this respect, even the simplest graph database such as Neo4j — which models the world as a bunch of JSON documents, some of which may contain pointers to other JSON documents, is much better than even the fanciest RDBMS. Granted there is no taxonomy or schema, and support for temporality is basic, but it’s easy to produce a much more naturalistic model of the world than will ever be possible if you have to break the things up into relations. Of course it is possible to automate this mapping by delegating the problem to code (for example by using ORMs or system meta-models) but this is a short-term fix that blows up as size and complexity increase. Code has unbounded complexity and is largely opaque to automated analysis —its contribution to combinatorial explosion becomes overwhelming at scale. All systems which are built upon ORMs evolve into ORM maintenance systems.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how different database technologies rank in terms of their data-modelling power — the extent to which they allow you to create naturalistic models of the world. To briefly explain the categories:</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2540/1*qa--bW5-ntB1BRuCcigiYQ.png" alt="comparing databases">
Databases ranked by data modelling power with leading open source examples of each type (in database land, if you are not open source, you have no long term future )</p>

<h2 id="key-value-stores-and-wide-column-stores">Key Value Stores and Wide Column Stores</h2>

<p>These databases exist primarily to provide computer programs with somewhere to save the variables that they use — they lack data-modelling features beyond basic datatypes. There is nothing wrong with this — computer programs need databases too. It is also, of course, possible to assemble complex data-models from these atomic units within programs, but this very quickly runs into the combinatorial explosion problem — almost everything is described in code leading to unbridled complexity growth.</p>

<h2 id="document-stores">Document Stores</h2>

<p>Document stores typically store data as a set of JSON documents —objects with tree-structures. The big feature of these databases over relational is that these documents are suitable for creating naturalistic models of things, with the tree structure expressing a containment (or has-a) relationship type. However, they are severely crippled because of poor support for modelling relationships — document relations are often expressed through embedding duplicates of other documents — a horrible, awful, solution which massively increases complexity over time.</p>

<h2 id="relational-databases">Relational Databases</h2>

<p>Relational databases are all about relations — tables that can be joined together to formed new relations. Foreign keys are used to express schematic relationships between tables. These relationships are untyped and semantically meaningless integers or strings are commonly used as keys. As a result relational databases are fairly impoverished in terms of their abilities to capture real world relationships — we can’t distinguish between containment (has-a) and other types of relationships so we can’t actually turn these relations back into objects without information that is external to the system — mostly in glue code or ORMs. Furthermore, translating to and from these relations and real world objects is rather intricate and leads to a very complex data model even for relatively simple aspects of the real world.</p>

<h2 id="property-graphs">Property Graphs</h2>

<p>Property graphs are basically document stores with a dash of relations added in that is to say, they are just a bunch of JSONs with some properties acting as special links to other JSONs (the in and out properties of edges). Even though they are quite primitive, they still have the most important features needed to create naturalistic models of the real world — things (nodes) with properties and relationships (edges).</p>

<h2 id="rdf-graphs">RDF Graphs</h2>

<p>RDF graphs have all of the features of the database models to the left, the thing that they really bring to the party is the concept of object types — via the <em>rdf:type</em> predicate — and not just simple datatypes.</p>

<h2 id="owl-graphs">OWL Graphs</h2>

<p>Graph databases that use the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to describe their data model are by far the most powerful in terms of data modelling capabilities, although OWL must be used with care as it can easily lead to an incomprehensibly complex data model (and in practice we need to choose a computable fragment of the language). Nevertheless, the really important aspects can be boiled down to 3 simple predicates that enable relationships between object types to be defined — <em>rdfs:domain</em> and <em>rdfs:range</em> support strongly typed relationships between objects, not just simple relationships, while <em>rdfs:subClassOf</em> supports type inheritance — and hence proper taxonomies — these combine to provide a fully featured type system, the holy grail of data modelling.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, while some people may feel that recent interest in graph databases is just another fad, I’m putting my money on graph — 20 years from now, non-graph databases will be niche and legacy applications.</p>

Let me first elaborate a little further why you would want to apply the tips and tricks from this blog post.</p><p>Git has become the de-facto standard of vcs over the past few years. You are probably using it for all your software development projects, and maybe even for your web blog, when you are blogging in markdown using a static site generator.</p><p>You also might be using Nodejs, python or other programming languages which are easier to run on Linux. Probably you have been using a Virtualbox VM or you are deploying your solutions in the cloud. The last thing you want is entering your password each time you connect to the VM via PuTTY. Or when you are trying to send some file to the VM using for example WinSCP.</p><p>Furthermore I usually use <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vagrant</a> for my VM’s. Using the setup below will improve my experience.</p><p>This blogpost will help you putting the settings in place so you only have to enter your ssh-key’s password only once. No matter what tool you are using following settings will apply to all of them when they use an ssh key to authenticate.</p><p>Prerequisites:</p><ul><li>Git (Git-extensions)</li><li>PuTTY</li><li>Puttygen (comes with Git-extensions)</li></ul><h2 id="Generate-a-SSH-key"><a href="#Generate-a-SSH-key" title="Generate a SSH key"></a>Generate a SSH key</h2><p>In order to generate an ssh key you can simply use <code>ssh-keygen.exe</code> which can be found in your Git installation directory in the <code>bin</code> folder. It is mandatory you name the keys exactly as in this blog post, since open_ssh will look for them using those names.</p><p>Open your <code>Git Bash</code> and execute following commands to generate your <code>open-ssh</code> key. Make sure you put a strong password on the key when prompted. This makes sure no one can use your key when you accidentally loose it somewhere.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C <span>"your@email.domain"</span></span><br><span>Generating public/private rsa key pair.</span><br><span>Enter file <span>in</span> <span>which</span> to save the key (/c/Users/Marco/.ssh/id_rsa):</span><br><span>Enter passphrase (empty <span>for</span> no passphrase):</span><br><span>Enter same passphrase again:</span><br><span>Your identification has been saved <span>in</span> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.</span><br><span>Your public key has been saved <span>in</span> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.</span><br><span>The key fingerprint is:</span><br><span>30:a5:c1:7a:bb:00:bf:7c:24:b7:4d:f1:d6:3d:e5:7e your@email.domain</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>We have just generated a key pair using 4096 bit encryption. PuTTY does not natively support the generated private key. Next step is to create a private PuTTY ssh key. This can be done using <code>puttygen.exe</code> which can be found in your <code>Git-extensions</code> installation directory or your putty installation directory. Open <code>puttygen.exe</code> by double clicking the executable and import your open-ssh key using the conversion menu as shown in following screenshot.<br><img src="https://marcofranssen.nl/images/fd197b4bbfc7467708b54cbeab2977214fb1e195.jpg" alt="Puttygen convert Open-SSH"><br>Then save the private key as <code>id_rsa.ppk</code> in the same folder as your <code>open-ssh</code> public and private key. Again don’t forget to put a password on the key (ideally the same as on your open-ssh key for your own convenience).</p><p>Now we have the ssh keys in place to be able to setup ssh connections either via <code>Bash</code> (id_rsa) or via <code>PuTTY</code> (id_rsa.ppk). The only problem is we have to enter the password each time in <code>bash</code> and we have to manually load the <code>PuTTY</code> key in <code>pageant.exe</code>.</p><h2 id="Pageant"><a href="#Pageant" title="Pageant"></a>Pageant</h2><p>The <code>Pageant</code> program that was installed as part of the <code>PuTTY</code> package, can store your keys and give them to <em>mRemote</em>, <em>WinSCP</em> and <em>PuTTY</em> as required. You can open <code>pageant.exe</code> and load your <code>id_rsa.ppk</code> key manually and provide the password. From now on <em>PuTTY</em>, <em>WinSCP</em> and any program that serves as a fronted for them (like <em>mRemote</em>) will first consult with the Pageant program if there is a key to use for the connection.</p><p>You might want to load this key automatically at startup. This can easily be done by using one of the following methods:</p><ol><li>Assuming you’ve allowed Pageant to take over the <code>ppk</code> suffix, you should be able to simply add the key files to the Windows “startup” folder.</li><li>Create a shortcut to the program that passes the key-files as parameters.

<p lang="pl"><strong>No, this article is not about some novel machine learning techniques, but it does cover the part of preparing a down to earth “<em>learning</em> <em>model</em>“.</strong></p>
<h2 id="ftoc-heading-1">Countless benefits of learning</h2>
<p>“<em>Leaders in every sector seem to agree: Learning is an imperative, not a cliché. Without it, careers derail and companies fail<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_6898_1" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_6898_1');">[1]</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6898_1">Petriglieri, G.

<p>During our lifespan, we regularly study new technical or lexical skills for different projects, and this is what we’ll look at – the way to enhance capabilities of the human brain.</p>
<p>Lifelong learning has dozens of benefits, and it’s not only increasing our value on the job market. According to the article from Harvard Business Review<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_6898_2" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_6898_2');">[2]</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6898_2">Coleman, J.

(2015) ‘Mental and Social Activity Delays the Symptoms of Alzheimer’s’. [10 June 2015] available from &lt;<a href="https://time.com/3916777/alzheimers-symptoms-delay/">https://time.com/3916777/alzheimers-symptoms-delay/</a>&gt;</span>. Although it requires us to dedicate some of our time to stay alone with our studying material, in the long term, we benefit from open doors to more social circles.</p>
<p>When we learn new stuff, mixing different approaches is a great strategy to stimulate our brain with more stimuli:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analogy – tell me what it’s like</li>
<li>Diagram – help me visualise it</li>
<li>Example – allow me to experience it</li>
<li>Plain English – describe it with everyday words</li>
<li>Technical definition – discuss the formal details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevertheless, in this post, we will focus on a technique of digital flashcards that can embrace all the 5 methodologies and remind us of them in the right (algorithmically calculated) time.</p>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-2">Spaced repetition vs cramming</h3>
<p>If I would tell you right now that in the next month there is an important exam coming on, how would you prepare yourself to it? I assume that you would take your time and by the very last week apply the stressful cramming technique – absorbing large amounts of information in a short period, and eventually forgetting all the material a few weeks after.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is the more effective method that you can apply for the upcoming tests? Thanks to the concept of learning from flashcards, we can implement the two excellent systems of spaced repetition and active recall. Here, you become more prepared for your next exam and achieve a higher recall as the time passes.</p>
<p>Classically, there is no spaced repetition post without the forgetting curve, which shows how you can lose newly learned information if you don’t attempt to retain it:</p>
<figure id="attachment_3488" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3488"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/pawelcislo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ebbinghaus_curve.png?resize=592%2C411&amp;ssl=1" alt="Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve" width="592" height="411" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/pawelcislo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ebbinghaus_curve.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/pawelcislo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ebbinghaus_curve.png?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3488">Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the latter (active recall) technique, we’re actively stimulating memory during the learning process. It contrasts with reading or watching information – passive review method.</p>
<p>Nowadays, using digital software, you can apply these methodologies while reviewing flashcards in synchronisation with your smartphone and PC. The SM-2 algorithm implemented in the software automatically calculates and proposes the time of next reviews so that you can only focus on the one thing.</p>
<p>Spaced repetition on its own is mostly used by medical students such as <a href="https://youtu.be/W-EpiaPcgTk">Ali Abdaal</a> (Cambridge University medicine graduate), but also by programmers such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urUZUWoTLo">Derek Banas</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/fPDy_qY1v1o">Daniel Bourke</a>.</p>
<p>As such, why spaced repetition isn’t more popular over cramming? Well, people don’t know about it, and it’s not as straightforward in its use. We talk big about self-improvement but don’t want to do any stinkin’ hard work. Can you imagine a student who wants to type his notes back home into a flashcard app?</p>

<h2 id="ftoc-heading-3">What can you study with flashcards?</h2>
<p>Let me start with the fact that the use of a Spaced Repetitive Software (SRS) like Anki can be your greatest weapon while preparing for a TV shows like “<em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em>” or “<em>Jeopardy!</em>“, where one player won almost $300 000<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_6898_4" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_6898_4');">[4]</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6898_4">Haviland, L. (2020) ‘“Jeopardy!” Champion Arthur Chu’s Old-Fashioned Strategy For Winning Paid Off Big Time’. [26 June 2020] available from &lt;<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jeopardy-champion-arthur-chus-old-fashioned-strategy-for-winning-paid-off-big-time.html/">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jeopardy-champion-arthur-chus-old-fashioned-strategy-for-winning-paid-off-big-time.html/</a>&gt;</span>.</p>
<p>When it comes to me, If I am not mistaken, I started using Anki about a year ago, and it definitely wasn’t consistent. Since then, I created a few decks (entire flashcard collections), but most of them were imported not only from the AnkiWeb but Quizlet and Memrise.</p>
<p>So far, the cards let me:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve my French (especially the cards based on the translation of sentences, not just pure words)</li>
<li>become more fluent with RegEx</li>
<li>learn Greek letters</li>
<li>practice Google Search Operators</li>
<li>relearn Polish voivodeships and the global geography</li>
<li>improve my understanding of Machine Learning theory (huge thanks to the <a href="https://machinelearningflashcards.com/">deck by Chris Albon</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t pay too much attention yet to the math or programming cards, but for now, I prefer to learn those topics from the online courses/books and then eventually facilitate them with the flashcards. Nonetheless, if you are wondering how flashcard can teach you programming, I would say that there are 3 main ways (types of cards):</p>
<ul>
<li>for me, the most enjoyable programming decks are showing a code on the front card, and then your objective is to guess what is its output (or maybe there is an error). An example deck: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/51975584" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">Python code quiz</a></li>
<li>some present an objective on the front side, such as “<em>What is the syntax to print your name</em>“, and the back side reveals “<code>print("your name")</code>“. An example deck:&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1394656023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">Python programming from Brian Spiering</a></li>
<li>other decks like&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1021974894" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">Think Python Vocabulary</a>&nbsp;will teach you more theory. For example, the front side will say “<em>Define: Source Code</em>“, and the answer will be “<em>A program in a high-level language before being compiled</em>“.</li>
</ul>
<p>Surely there are more applications of Anki, which I recently discussed in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/gtjyos/my_current_main_decks_what_are_yours/">Reddit post</a> and brought up an engaging discourse of 93 comments.</p>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-4">The “<em>magic</em>” behind the SM-2 algorithm</h3>
<p>The SM-2 algorithm from the late 1980s is responsible in Anki for its core function of scheduling your repetitions, with the modification of considering each card’s priority.</p>
<p>Briefly speaking, Anki determines card scheduling by the option we choose after revealing the answer (“<em>Again</em>“, “<em>Hard</em>“, “<em>Good</em>” or “<em>Easy</em>“).&nbsp; Depending on the selected option (our familiarity with the card), the following formula applies different <code>ease%</code> and <code>interval modifier</code>:</p>
<p><span data-display="true">New \ Interval = current \ interval \times ease\% \times interval \ modifier</span></p><p>Watching this great explanation will further and more intuitively illustrate how your use of SRS spaces the next reviews. I also recommend applying settings recommended by its author (presented in the form of screenshots at 07:31 and 12:34).</p>

<p>Another strong point of Anki is its way of providing us with lots of statistics, where some are summarised in the form of histograms. There I’ve got a sample estimation of the number of cards that I’m likely to study in the next 30 days of my French set.</p>

<p>I know such dull explanations of spaced repetition can be tiresome, but luckily there are interactive simulations in your browser to help with that. For that, there is nothing better than Nicky’s blog post: “<a href="https://ncase.me/remember/">How To Remember Anything Forever-Ish</a>“.</p>
<h2 id="ftoc-heading-5">Setting up Anki</h2>
<p>At first, the use of this software won’t be the most straightforward in comparison to <a href="https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-14">its alternatives</a>, but as we know, there are no ideal solutions. In this section, I’ll provide you with the information that will save you lots of time to start your first studying session.</p>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-6">Quick installation guide</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create your&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/account/register" rel="nofollow">AnkiWeb account</a>.</li>
<li>Download&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download" rel="nofollow">Anki desktop application</a>&nbsp;(Windows/Mac/Linux).</li>
<li>Log in to your AnkiWeb account inside the desktop application and create or import your first flashcards.</li>
<li>Start learning!
<ul>
<li>Optionally, download the Anki mobile app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki" rel="nofollow">Android</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387" rel="nofollow">iOS</a>) and learn on the go. Don’t forget to log in to your AnkiWeb account inside the app and sync your repository.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ftoc-heading-7">How to use Anki</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, installing Anki doesn’t make you ready to start your study sessions. It’s somewhat comparable to buying a blank notebook from which you could’ve studied, but it’s missing your notes. Luckily for us, the community is quite generous, and there’re lots of great flashcards already available. You’ll find some great examples in <a href="https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-11">the further part of this post</a>.</p>
<p>Just like before, it’s best to present some things visually. Here is one of the most practical YouTube tutorials showing the most common Anki functions (card reveal, clozes, image occlusion). If you don’t feel like watching the entire clip, you can use the predefined timestamps to go to the right part (to see them, open the video on the YouTube website).</p>
<iframe id="_ytid_24704" width="450" height="253" data-origwidth="450" data-origheight="253" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJFw9gBkvcY?enablejsapi=1&amp;start=237&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe>

<p>As previously mentioned, we can get some premade cards, but it’s like learning from someone’s else notes. Making cards isn’t as bad once we make at least one of them. I bet you’ll also enjoy card formatting with the CSS code, so the card looks more eye-pleasing (but don’t spend too much time on that!).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are ways to facilitate the card-creation process. For example, if you tend to annotate some text online (such as I do with <a href="https://hypothes.is/users/pyxelr">Hypothesis</a>), you can use your annotation on the front side of the card and the highlighted part as the answer (back side). Apart from Hypothesis, you may also try using a different annotation tool – Polar that officially supports such conversion <a href="https://getpolarized.io/docs/anki-sync-for-spaced-repetition.html">straight from its software</a>. You can even get automatically generated cards from the displayed word definitions or highlights you create on your Kindle device (the required tools are mentioned in <a href="https://pawelcislo.com/2020/07/10/optimising-our-learning-retention-rate-with-srs-anki/#ftoc-heading-12">the further part of this post</a>).</p>

Within a single platform, payment providers can scale their network across different markets seamlessly. There's no SIM card juggling, multiple carrier agreements to manage, and no need to integrate with various cellular management platforms. Hologram is always expanding our network, and with over-the-air profile updates, we can ensure devices have the best coverage at the best price in each market.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>When we moved to Ketchum two winters ago, Elizabeth got a job waitressing at a little eight-table local restaurant.</p>
<p>The walls were still blank on her first day of work. They’d only been serving guests for a week.</p>
<p>January 2019 marked the restaurant’s first full month of pumping out pizzas and wine. They went on to do ~3x more<span></span> <span>“</span>monthly” revenue than we did that same month at <a href="https://sendbottles.com/">Bottle</a>. And we had a three year head start!</p>
<p>If each business was reduced to an Excel sheet comparing only revenue, their<span></span> <span>“</span>$100k of sales in the first month” narrative would outshine our<span></span> <span>“</span>5-digit <span>MRR</span> three years in” narrative.</p>
<p>But pizza comes with significant marginal costs: flour, San Marzano’s, mozzarella, cooks, hosts and waiters. There’s a reason I’m happy owning Bottle’s current and future cash flow instead.</p>
<p>Everyone jokes about using revenue as a metric.<span></span> <span>“</span>What we lose per unit we’ll make up in volume!”</p>
<p>But I’ll bite. For software businesses, revenue is a meaningful metric because costs are fairly fixed and familiar: engineers, ads, and <span>AWS</span> bills. This is why the entire SaaS market has been trading ~10x revenue, independent of vertical.</p>
<p><span>“</span>Fixed and familiar costs” don’t apply to the newest venture-backed businesses, though. As revenue becomes the ultimate metric, software-enabled companies are hacking top line revenue. It’s Goodhart’s Law.</p>
<p>I saw a tweet by Garry Tan yesterday, sharing Truepill’s latest $25 million round:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>Truepill revenue reached $48 million in 2018 and nearly $100 million in 2019; it could reach an estimated $200 million this year as it pushes further into working with health plans, drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers.”<a href="#footnote-1PW1" id="ref-1PW1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe those revenue numbers are compelling. Maybe the aren’t. I can’t tell because revenue has lost its meaning. It got me thinking about three things:</p>
<h2 id="restaurant-revenue">1. Restaurant Revenue</h2>
<p>I propose a new term: Restaurant Revenue. Restaurant Revenue is revenue that comes with real and significant costs. A pizza. A pizza delivery. A short-term tenant inside a long-term lease. A flu shot. A prescription. These things are inherently different than <span>HTTP</span> packets.</p>
<p>Pharmacies in particular come with incredibly high marginal costs.</p>
<p>I used to think Walgreens used Doritos and Coke to lure people in to buy high-margin drugs. It’s actually the other way around. The pharmacy is a loss-leader to get people to come buy toilet paper and razors. Pharmacies are so low-margin that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wal-mart-stores-results-pharmacy/wal-marts-drug-problem-pharmacy-business-drags-on-profit-idUSKCN0QO01V20150819">the undisputed king of low-margin is struggling to make drugs profitable</a>. Their rival <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wal-mart-stores-results-pharmacy/wal-marts-drug-problem-pharmacy-business-drags-on-profit-idUSKCN0QO01V20150819">Target gave up completely</a>.</p>
<p>Truepill is an API-enabled pharmacy. It’s a great idea. But how much of the $200 million in projected revenue is zero-margin prescription drug revenue?<a href="#footnote-2PW1" id="ref-2PW1"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>If it’s mostly Restaurant Revenue, then it’s a vanity metric.</p>
<h2 id="alpha-revenue">2. Alpha Revenue</h2>
<p>Restaurant Revenue isn’t all bad. Lots of software-enabled companies genuinely reduce costs and induce demand in novel ways.</p>
<p>Thus I propose a second term: Alpha Revenue. Alpha Revenue is the contribution margin that, with a straight face, you can say is added because of software.</p>
<p>Cloud kitchens and Chick-fil-a both sell fried chicken sandwiches. Let’s say a cloud kitchen has trained a robot to hand-batter all the chicken breasts. In doing so, they might knock $0.50 in cost off each chicken sandwich. Alpha Revenue.</p>
<p>Or take Bungalow. They can induce demand from a well-designed website. They can make it easy to split the house and rent by the room. This enables them to turn 3-bedroom houses renting for $3k/mo into 4-bedroom houses renting for $1.2k/room. The Restaurant Revenue is $4.8k/mo, but the Alpha Revenue is $1.8k/mo.</p>
<h2 id="business-models">3. Business Models</h2>
<p>Eventually, the market will sort the valuations out. But, for any business that lists software engineers in its <span>S1</span>, the market is struggling to discriminate between Restaurant Revenue and Alpha Revenue.</p>
<p>It’s how you end up with an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=fin&amp;q=NYSE%3A%20LMND#scso=_jawHX8TII6CP9PwP_p6D8AI1:0">app-driven insurance provider worth $4 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The downstream valuations are having a negative impact on new startups. There’s a pressure to build revenue as fast as possible, Restaurant Revenue or Alpha Revenue be damned.</p>
<p>My friend is starting a women’s hormonal health company. She wants to pair women with <span>PCOS</span> with providers. <span>VC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s are pushing her to<span></span> <span>“</span>own the entire stack” and bring healthcare providers onto payroll. It’s an easy way to book a lot of top line Restaurant Revenue. She’s wary.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/ahead-a-platform-that-connects-psychiatrists-with-patients-raises-9-million/">Truepill just invested in Ahead</a>, a company with full-time therapists on staff ready to provide Telehealth treatment for <span>ADHD</span>, depression, and anxiety. Lots of Restaurant Revenue. Can they produce Alpha Revenue, though?</p>
<p>If Airbnb was raising a Series A today, it’s tough to imagine <span>VC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s not pushing them to<span></span> <span>“</span>buy the real estate yourselves.” Get the top line revenue to swell, raise the next round, pass off to the public market.</p>
<p>There are better business models than restaurants. Google, Lyft, and Airbnb all invented not only new products, but new business models. Where did all the business model innovation go? I don’t know if it’s a failure of vision or the fact that <span>VC</span><span></span><span>’</span>s got sick of battling independent contractor employment law.</p>
<p>I’ll be curious to see which of these restaurant models end up with enduring Alpha Revenue.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<div>
<article>
<p><span>At the beginning of 2019 StorageOS embarked on a significant development effort to build v2.0 of our product. The cloud native landscape had significantly changed since the inception and subsequent release of StorageOS v1.0, with Kubernetes emerging from the container orchestrator battle royale as the clear winner. We observed two key trends amongst our customers and the industry in general.</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, customers wanted to run bigger clusters – in the 10’s or even 100’s of nodes. Secondly, customers wanted to run multiple clusters and for the clusters to interact in various patterns. We designed StorageOS 2.0 to address these trends.</span></p>
<p><span>Given the significant development effort to create StorageOS v2.0, we wanted to ensure the testing toolkit and workflow we used was up to the task of verifying our reliability and scalability. At StorageOS, product testing is undertaken by the Product Reliability Engineering (PRE) team, and we tasked ourselves with engineering a new testing framework and suite of tests to do justice to the product the company was building.</span></p>
<p><span>Our previous testing framework (known internally as ‘vol-test’) was based around a set of libraries and scripting tools that included the ability to provision a variety of environments on a variety of platforms for the tests to run in. Vol-test also included functional, end to end, stress and benchmarking tests for the StorageOS API as well as StorageOS running in Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span>While feature rich, we often found ourselves wanting a more expressive language and toolset. Additionally, the provisioning and testing functions were closely coupled – which made the system inconvenient to work with at times. We staged our own version of the perennial engineering ‘re-write or improve’ debate and settled on separating the testing and provisioning functions and focusing on a better way to write and execute tests. What we ended up with was three systems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>T2Infra – </span><i><span>a provisioning framework for creating reproducible environments quickly</span></i></li>
<li><span>T2 – </span><i><span>a testing framework and suite of tests to verify StorageOS behaviour and API outside of Kubernetes</span></i></li>
<li><span>Kubecover – </span><i><span>a testing framework and suite of tests to run within Kubernetes</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span>A major consideration was what language to create the new testing frameworks in. The two languages that we considered were Python and Golang; the former due to ease of use and our team’s familiarity with it and the latter because Kubernetes and surrounding projects are often written in Golang. Perhaps more importantly, much of StorageOS is written in Golang too.</span></p>
<p><span>The use of a common language between our Reliability Engineers and our Software Engineering colleagues is a great advantage when testing, as it allows for closer collaboration and tightened development cycles. The static typing and easily accomplished concurrency that Golang offered has been extremely welcomed and has helped to drive development of significantly more complex tests at a significantly reduced cost.</span></p>
<p><b>T2Infra – Fast environment provisioning using Ignite/Firecracker</b></p>
<p><span>T2Infra is a provisioning framework that lets us stand up testing environments quickly. We generally run our tests on </span><a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/"><span>Firecracker</span></a> <span>VMs (for more information about Firecracker check out this </span><a href="https://unixism.net/2019/10/how-aws-firecracker-works-a-deep-dive/"><span>blog </span></a><span>by Shuveb Hussain) by leveraging the </span><a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite"><span>Ignite</span></a> <span>project from our good friends at </span><a href="https://www.weave.works/"><span>Weave</span></a><span>. In essence, Ignite provisions Firecracker virtual machines that run StorageOS containers. That seems like a lot of layers of abstraction but this combination of tooling gives us; highly reproducible, quick to provision, isolated environments for running tests.</span></p>
<p><span>These qualities are important to us as a reproducible environment translates directly into more deterministic tests, while fast provisioning times allow us to spin up a fresh environment for every test. Using a new environment per test means that tests do not “cross-contaminate” one another further increasing the reliability of our tests.</span></p>
<p><b>T2 – Testing outside of Kubernetes</b></p>
<p><span>T2 is a testing framework that was created to test and verify the behaviours of StorageOS while driving StorageOS via its API. The framework consists of libraries to access the StorageOS API, to cause various kinds of ‘chaos’, provide test orchestration functions, and of course, the tests themselves.</span></p>
<p><span>Because we are using lightweight VMs, we have familiar tools available to us for introducing controlled disruption into the test environment. For example we leverage </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables"><span>IPTables</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/ipset"><span>IPSet</span></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/tc"><span>TC</span></a> <span>to cause network partitions, inject latency and restrict bandwidth between nodes. These tools are controlled via the T2 framework during test runtime so changes are entirely dynamic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For additional insight into the test environment, it is important to collect both logs and traces from inside our VMs. Running additional containers inside the VMs such as the </span><a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/"><span>Jaeger</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.fluentd.org/"><span>Fluentd</span></a> <span>agents for collecting traces and logs is simple to do with systemd manifests. As each test spins up its own environment it is easy to collect and separate traces and logs from different tests. For more insight into how important tracing is for understanding a distributed system </span><a href="https://dgraph.io/blog/post/solving-jepsen-with-opencensus"><span>Manish Rai Jain from Dgraph</span></a><span> wrote an interesting blog about how he used tracing and Jaeger to squash a bug exposed by </span><a href="https://jepsen.io/"><span>Jepsen</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><b>Kubecover – Adding Kubernetes to the mix</b></p>
<p><span>While T2 is useful for testing StorageOS in a dedicated, predictable environment, the final arbiter of StorageOS as a product is of course how we behave within Kubernetes – since this is how our customers run our product.</span></p>
<p><span>Kubecover is a testing framework written in Golang that uses the </span><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go"><span>Kubernetes </span></a><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go"><span>Golang</span></a> <span>client directly as well as the </span><a href="https://github.com/storageos/go-api/tree/master/v2"><span>StorageOS API</span> <span>Client</span></a> <span>to drive tests of StorageOS within Kubernetes clusters. Our Kubecover framework leverages great work by </span><a href="https://github.com/darkowlzz/"><span>darkowlzz</span></a> <span>to make </span><a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/"><span>Kubernetes in Docker</span></a><span> (Kind) work with Ignite as a backend instead of Docker. The changes allow us to spin up a Kind cluster with each Kind “node” running on a separate Ignite provisioned Firecracker VM. The advantage of using Kind is that we can spin up local and test environments in a matter of seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>Given the many popular Kubernetes distributions that exist we can also use Kubecover binaries in testing pipelines that run against other Kubernetes distributions. For example we routinely run tests against managed Kubernetes services such as AKS and EKS, as well as various versions of upstream Kubernetes running on cloud infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Why have two separate testing frameworks?</b></p>
<p><span>The reason for having two separate test frameworks is separation of concerns. T2 is for end to end testing of the StorageOS container, driven via the StorageOS API, while Kubecover is for testing StorageOS integration with, and behaviours in Kubernetes, driven via the </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/"><span>CSI</span></a><span> interface. Kubernetes adds layers of abstraction that are not always helpful in the end to end testing of StorageOS, so testing StorageOS behaviour is something we generally handle in T2. Testing of Kubernetes specific behaviours then takes place in Kubecover. In general our approach is to first verify the StorageOS API behaviour before adding testing of behaviours running StorageOS in Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span>For a more specific example of how we make these distinctions, consider testing of volume resize. We first tested volume resize in T2 to verify that the StorageOS API is behaving correctly and the feature works as we expect it to. Once the correct behaviour was verified, we wrote tests in Kubecover to ensure that CSI resize requests were also being handled correctly. The resize requests in Kubernetes are generated by editing the size of a Persistent Volume Claim so requests come via the CSI API.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>How do we spec our tests?</b></p>
<p><span>In order to have a consistent and clear description each test gets its own </span><a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/"><span>Gherkin</span></a> <span>spec, so the test is described in a </span><span>`GIVEN, WHEN, THEN`</span><span> syntax. The test spec should give the reader a clear indication of what the test is going to do and provides context for the test code itself. Having a consistent approach to documenting our tests has made it easy for anyone in our team to triage a test failure and understand what the test is doing. This approach is particularly helpful when it comes to more complex test cases.</span></p>
<p><span>Typically we begin spec’ing out tests by following the “happy path”. For example the “happy path” spec for resizing a volume looks like the below:</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN the volume is resized to size y where y is greater than x</span>

<span>THEN the volume will display its new size</span>

<span>AND the block device size will reflect this size</span>

<span>AND the filesystem will reflect a new larger size</span></pre>
<p><span>The happy path test is important as it proves that the feature works as expected. The next priority is an “unhappy path” test that proves the API is not just accepting and actioning any and all requests, whether valid or not.</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN the volume is resized to size y where y is less than or equal to x</span>

<span>THEN the resize will fail with an easy to understand error</span></pre>
<p><span>Once a happy and unhappy path has been set we investigate cases where failure is assumed. For example in cases of concurrent requests, it is important that we only action the first, and error the rest, as detailed in the following spec:</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN two concurrent resize requests are made to size y and size z</span>

<span>THEN only one resize will be actioned</span>

<span>AND the other request will receive an error response</span>

</pre>
<p><span>As the StorageOS control plane guarantees linearisable volume updates, one of the concurrent resize requests will fail because each resize request will be using the same volume object version. The first request to reach the API will cause a version bump so the subsequent request will be failed. However there are also linearisable operations that we verify work as intended, such as having </span><a href="https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/replication/#delta-sync"><span>replicas rejoin</span></a> <span>while a resize is occurring. Once the replicas have rejoined they should also reflect the new size of the volume.</span></p>
<p><b>How we run our tests</b></p>
<p><span>We run all of the tests in T2 against development containers throughout the day. …</span></p></article></div></div></div></div>

July 10, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/cutlet-python-romaji-converter.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/cutlet-python-romaji-converter.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago I released <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a>, a Python library and application for
converting arbitrary Japanese text to romaji.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/c431038e/cutlet.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/c431038e/img/cutlet.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>Katsu curry illustrated by <a href="https://www.irasutoya.com/2014/12/blog-post_479.html">Irasutoya</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Compared to other libraries cutlet has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>it uses <a href="https://github.com/polm/fugashi">fugashi</a>, so you can re-use your existing dictionary</li>
<li>words of foreign origin optionally use their original spelling ("cutlet" instead of "katsu") thanks to <a href="https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/">Unidic</a></li>
<li>it's easy to add exceptions for specific words</li>
<li>a built-in slug mode for URL generation</li>
</ul>
<p>The foreign spelling feature in particular is something I've never seen in
another system, and in some cases is important for getting things right. For
example, "Sweden Hills" is a neighborhood in Hokkaido, but even the Post Office
data gives the romaji as the odd-looking "Suedenhiruzu". With cutlet the output
would be "Sweden hill" and it's easy to add an exception if you want "Hills".</p>
<p>Here's an example of usage from Python:</p>
<pre><code>from cutlet import Cutlet
katsu = Cutlet()
katsu.romaji("カツカレー")
# =&gt; 'Cutlet curry'
katsu.slug("カツカレー")
# =&gt; 'cutlet-curry'
</code></pre>
<p>One of my main motivations for making this library was dealing with the
frequent case where using Japanese text isn't an option for technical reasons,
or it is an option but comes with downsides. A common example is urls - while
you can use Japanese text in URLs, in many situations the text becomes
unreadable hex escapes, so it's not actually helpful for anyone. Generating an
article slug in romaji creates something that can still be interpreted in
Japanese and is free from any technical compatability worries.</p>
<p>cutlet is available for install via pip, and works on the command line as well
as via Python. If you make use of it I'd love to hear about it. If there's a
feature you'd like it to include feel free to <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet/issues">open an issue</a>. While I
don't have any more major features planned, I would like to make a web version
you can use to try it out; I'll post about that on Twitter if I ever get it set
up. Ψ</p>

                        <li>You don't need a high-end laptop, since most of your work will only take place in a browser. Snagging a cheap or used device is a good option. (Chromebooks that allow USB booting are a solid option as well)</li>

                <li>Boot into Tails OS via the USB flash drive on your burner laptop</li>

            <h2>Important &amp; Helpful Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Never use a custom domain name - these require some of your personal information when being registered. Even with whois privacy protection, certain law enforcement can demand for these credentials.</li>
                <li>Feel free to use a VPN, though Tor is more than enough for your needs.</li>
                <li>Whenever you boot Tails OS, it will load with a fresh install. To keep files on the USB even when shutdown, look into using <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html">Encrypted Persistent Storage </a>. Please note: <i>this is not recommended</i> for obvious security risks.</li>
                <li>Run your articles through multiple translation converters. Edit minor mistakes afterwards. This avoids engines and tools picking up on your writing style.</li>
                <li>Always backup your articles. The safest bet is to use <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a></li>
                <li>Don't expect to collect revenue with your blog. It is extremely difficult to accept payment without some form of tracking to your personal information. If anything, maybe allow your users to donate to a charity you would like to support.</li>
                <li>WordPress is the suggested blog platform but there are others to choose from:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Try your best to avoid publishing articles on your home or work network. Make a trip to the local coffee shop during busy hours and post it then.</li>
                <li>Randomly select different times to publish articles. Avoid creating a trackable pattern.</li>
                <li>Never work on anything related to your blog unless using the burner laptop and Tails OS. This might seem simple, but one little slip-up is all it takes.</li>
            </ol>

July 10, 2020 | http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/slovianto1.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/slovianto1.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><b>Slovianto</b> is a highly simplified form of Interslavic that allows non-Slavic people to express themselves at a very basic level when visiting Slavic countries or maintaining contact with Slavs via the Internet. Grammar is limited to a bare minimum, and forms that are not strictly necessary are not used at all. Because it does not contain anything that cannot be found in the Slavic languages, the result wil not look or sound too awkward to Slavic speakers, but rather remind them of the kind of language used by small children.</p><p>Slovianto can also be used as a first step in the process of learning the „real” Interslavic language. It has been constructed in such way that it can gradually be expanded with new bits and pieces that occur in more complex versions. Thus, we distinguish three different levels, each of them adding new elements that bring Slovianto closer to Interslavic:
</p><p>The working title <b>Slovianto</b> is a portmanteau word for „Slavic Esperanto”. This name, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, refers to the simplicity of Slovianto: it has no gender, no cases, no aspect, little conjugation and no irregularity. Yet, that is where the similarity to Esperanto ends, because Slovianto's means of simplification are in fact far more similar to those used by Interlingua.</p><p>Slovianto can be written in the Latin alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet, but we will concentrate on the Latin alphabet here:

</p><p>In the <a href="http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/en-ms.html">Interslavic dictionary</a> you will find other characters as well, like <b>ò</b>, <b>ų</b>, <b>å</b> or <b>ť</b>. You can simply ignore the diacritics and read them as <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>t</b> etc. That goes for <b>ě</b>, too. The only characters that keep their diacritics in Latin orthography are <b>č</b>, <b>š</b> and <b>ž</b>. If you find writing them inconvenient, you can always use <b>cz</b>, <b>sz</b> and <b>zs</b> (or <b>cx</b>, <b>sx</b> and <b>zx</b>) as an alternative.</p><p>Accentuation is fairly free. What matters more is that you speak slowly and clearly. As a general guideline, it would deserve recommendation to put stress on the antepenultimate syllable.</p><div width="90%"><tbody><tr><td>

							<p>PARIS — The French Parliament unanimously agreed on Thursday to introduce a nationwide age verification system for pornography websites, months after President Emmanuel Macron pledged to protect children against such content.</p>
<p>Macron made the protection of children against adult content online a high-profile issue well before the coronavirus crisis hit. In January, tech companies, internet services providers and the adult movies industry <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/les-fournisseurs-d-acces-des-acteurs-du-web-et-marc-dorcel-s-engagent-pour-proteger-les-mineurs-du-porno-20200117" target="_blank">signed a voluntary charter</a>, pledging to roll out tools to help ensure minors don’t have access to pornographic content.</p>
<p>Within a broader law on domestic violence, the Senate decided <a href="https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/parlementaire/porno-le-senat-bloque-l-accessibilite-des-sites-aux-mineurs-183097" target="_blank">in June</a> to introduce an amendment requiring pornography websites to implement an age verification mechanism.</p>
<p>In order to enforce the law, the French audiovisual regulator CSA will be granted new powers to audit and sanction companies that do not comply — sanctions could go as far as blocking access to the websites in France with a court order.</p>
<p>The choice of verification mechanisms will be left up to the platforms. But lawmakers have suggested using credit card verification — a system first adopted by the U.K., which mulled similar plans to control access to pornography but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/uk-drops-plans-for-online-pornography-age-verification-system" target="_blank">had to drop them</a> in late 2019 because of technical difficulties and privacy concerns. Italy also approved a <a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/gu/2020/06/29/162/sg/pdf" target="_blank">similar bill in late June</a>, which raised the same concerns over its feasibility and <a href="https://www.key4biz.it/filtro-anti-porno-nicita-agcom-limiti-tecnici-norma-pillon-a-rischio-disapplicazione/312167/" target="_blank">compliance with the EU laws</a>.</p>
<p>As private actors could implement their own solutions, the new law also highlights the challenges of digital identification. In Brussels, there are growing calls to introduce an EU-wide digital ID system that would allow users to bypass Google and Facebook’s identification ecosystem. For politicians, including French Junior Digital Minister Cédric O, systems of identification online are <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">a matter of digital sovereignty</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate has already voted on the bill. Following an agreement today between senators and lawmakers from the lower house National Assembly, a final vote will be held again in the Senate where the bill is expected to pass.</p>
<p>Senators have also suggested using FranceConnect, a tool developed by the state to help users connect to public services such as tax collection and health insurance.</p>
<p>In the face of skepticism and privacy concerns from campaigners, O has since <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">denied</a> that the national connection tool would be used.</p>
<p>"We voted on one principle, which is to give the CSA the obligation to monitor the protection of minors, but the CSA is free to find the right way for sites to comply with their injunction," the text’s rapporteur in the Senate Marie Mercier told POLITICO.</p>
<h3><strong>Minitel rose</strong></h3>
<p>Key actors from the French porn industry have long called for new measures to modernize a French law which was drafted at the time of the “Minitel rose,” a very popular pornography service in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“[With this law] we can already fine up to 75,000 euros and three years of prison, but no one applies it,” said Mercier.</p>
<p>The conservative politician worked on the amendment after hearings with French pornography producer Marc Dorcel, ex-adult actress-turned-documentary-director Ovidie and child protection NGOs.</p>
<p>“Most of those who abide by the law feel that it’s unfair that the [sites] keep doing their business without restriction," Mercier added.</p>
<p>For years, one of the most difficult tasks for French regulators has been finding a way to enforce local laws on foreign services.</p>
<p>With this new law, if the site does not comply within 15 days after a first warning from the audiovisual regulator CSA, the regulator will be able to ask the Paris Court of Justice to send an order to telecom operators to block the access to these sites from France.</p>

        <p><i>posted on 29 May 2020</i></p><p>Yes, you read it right! Don’t let the feature requests you receive from your customers drive your product roadmap. Instead, let the real problems they are facing do.</p>

<p>Nearly 4 years ago, when I had just transitioned from engineering to product management here is how I used to respond to one of the most important questions that you get asked as a product manager.</p>

<p><a href="https://akshayd.in/2020/05/29/Don-t-let-feature-requests-from-your-customers-drive-your-product-roadmap!/">Read More</a></p>

<!--more-->

<p><span>Question</span> - Why do you think this feature should be on the roadmap? <br>
<span>Answer</span> - Because customers XYZ and ABC have asked for it
</p>
<p>It sounds naive in the hindsight but I’ve cut myself some slack given it was my first time as a product manager.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we as product managers consider the number of customers that have asked for a particular feature as a parameter to add weight to the decision of adding it to the roadmap. However, it is easy to fall prey to this vanity metric by right away acknowledging the feature request as a gap in your offering that needs to be filled without analysing the feature request thoroughly. Analysing your customers’ feature requests in a proper manner will help you identify the right set of problems your customers are facing. Many times, you will realize that the problem does not have to be solved by the exact feature the customers are suggesting.</p>

<p>While there are numerous ways in which one could dissect the feature request , the <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/02/the-5-whys.html"><b>FIVE WHYS framework</b></a> provides a simple and effective way of getting to the core of the problem.  The 5 Whys framework is an iterative interrogation technique to determine the root cause of the problem by repeatedly asking the question -  “Why” . Here is an example of my recent experience of using this framework to address a customer’s feature request.</p>

<div>
<p><span>Customer</span> : We’d like an API endpoint to fetch the loyalty information of users. </p><p>
<span>Me</span>: Could you please let us know why you would want an API endpoint since you already have this information in the members’ report? </p><p>
<span>Customer</span> :   We’d like to build an automated process of getting the information via an API every night and dump that information at an FTP location ?</p><p>
<span>Me</span> : Alright, sounds good. Could you please tell me why you would want to dump this information at an FTP location ?  What happens after you dump it to FTP location.</p><p> 
<span>Customer</span> : We have crons that would read the information and sync the information with the contacts in Hubspot CRM . </p><p>
<span>Me</span> : Okay. Why do you sync the loyalty information in Hubspot ? </p><p>
<span>Customer</span> :  We want to use the loyalty information to be included in the marketing emails that we send.</p><p>
<span>Me</span> : We already have Hubspot integration underway exactly for this use case. Every time the loyalty information of the user changes, the change will be synced with the Hubspot user profile automatically with the integration. You could then set triggers in Hubspot to send out emails with the loyalty information. 
</p></div>

<p>In the above example, although it seemed like a feature request for a new API endpoint, the ultimate job that the customer was looking to get done with this API was to include the loyalty information in the marketing emails sent via Hubspot. The actual problem was unearthed by repeatedly asking the question “Why”. Evidently, the plethora of information this framework gives you as you go deeper layer by layer not only helps you reach to the core of the problem but also gives you holistic insights about it. You may choose any other framework that helps with problem analysis. The bottomline is to ensure that you thoroughly understand the rationale behind the feature request.</p>

<p>Customers will often ask you the world. More often than not, the feature requests your customers raise if considered verbatim, have the potential to derail your product strategy. Tending to such feature requests without peeling the layers of the onion may help you pacify a couple of customers but will harm your product in the long run. For a winning product strategy , it is very imperative to choose solving those problems that align with your product and company goals.</p>

<p>After all , effective product management is not just about solving problems but about choosing  the right set of problems to solve.</p>

<p>This has been an interesting year! When the pandemic came and left us all housebound, I used it as an excuse to do some remedial work I’d been dreading—moving Pinboard onto modern versions of PHP and MySQL. Things had gotten to the point where I couldn’t even run a bug-for-bug identical copy of the site on a modern laptop, and the servers themselves were overdue for system upgrades. 

</p><p>Much of the core code on the site dated back to 2009-2010 and was written by Past Me, a vindictive, inscrutable nemesis who devoted his life to sabotaging Present Me. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/past_me.jpg">

</p><p><i>Past Me laying his snares in 2009.</i></p>

<p>Doing this on a live system is like performing kidney transplants on a playing mariachi band. The best case is that no one notices a change in the music; you chloroform the players one at a time and try to keep a steady hand while the band plays on.  The worst case scenario is that the music stops and there is no way to unfix what you broke, just an angry mob. It is very scary.

</p><p>But I got it done! It helped in this process that I was in Japan, since I could do most work at night while my US/European customers slept or wept into their phones or whatever it is people do at night nowadays. 

</p><p>The site is now on a 2020 foundation (specifically, it’s on PHP 7 and a current MySQL), and with everything less brittle I can start making bigger changes. One of those is to make the site look okay on mobile phones, now that I’m finally convinced they aren’t a fad. You can see the beginnings of this reworking on the <a href="https://pinboard.in/about/">about page</a> and in other corners of the site.

</p><p>Another is to finish the new API. The current one was designed to be a drop-in replacement for the old Delicious API and lacks important features, like any way to say “show me stuff that has changed since timestamp X”, or interact with Pinboard features that weren’t present in Delicious.

</p><p>Another analogy I’d use for this kind of upgrade work is clearing a disused garden. In the process you may unearth remarkable stuff—an old wagon wheel, a Roman urn—hiding among the weeds. But it’s mostly interesting to you, and not to the people who are waiting in line at your vegetable stand.

</p><p>In my case, I found the skeletons of dead features (remember placemarks?) as well as spectral ghosts of defunct services like Google Reader, Readability, and of course Delicious itself, which now slumbers peacefully while I try to figure out a way to bring it up without dealing with the waves of automated spam still pointed at the site. But I’ll save that for another post.

</p><p>Now that I have a fresher memory of how the site works, and am not so afraid of touching anything, I look forward to doing some long-delayed feature development.

<p>Another new blog on the internet – aren’t there already enough of
those? <a href="http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs">Some would say
no</a>.
I, for one, am a fan of the open, interoperable, indie web,
even if that seems to stack the cards against you.<sup id="fnref:indie-disadvantage"><a href="#fn:indie-disadvantage">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I’ll keep this introductory post brief. We<sup id="fnref:we"><a href="#fn:we">2</a></sup> want to start a SaaS
product, and while there seem to be awfully many “founder stories”
around of people magically getting 50k downloads, $10k MRR, etc., we
don’t often hear about the long, rocky path to sustainable success.
There’s often scant detail about the initial steps: ideation,
validation, etc. Also, all these whiz-bang success stories suffer
from enormous survivorship bias. Not to mention they leave us normal
folks feeling quite inadequate, when in reality there’s enormous luck
involved, too.<sup id="fnref:luck"><a href="#fn:luck">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, “failure” isn’t sexy. As a result there seem to be few
resources online talking about the things people have tried that
<em>haven’t</em> worked. We want to take a more optimistic view. From each
“failure” we hope to learn things, get better at what we’re trying to
do, so that 10 years from now, looking back, we can point at all the
hustle that goes into trying to Build Something.</p>
<p>We figured we might as well challenge ourselves to get something out
there, right now, instead of waiting until perhaps one day if and/or
when we manage to create something successful. This way, at the very
least we’re keeping ourselves accountable by publicly writing about
what we’re trying, and who knows, we might be able to say something
that someone somewhere finds useful. We’re also very keen for
feedback, so any and all input is more than welcome. Ideas, critique,
links to resources, we want it, our inboxes are open. Have a look at
the <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/contact/">Contact us page</a> if you want to get in touch, or try our
low-budget comments box down below!</p>
<p>We’re just trying to muddle along making our own way here, so we’re
bound to have many a false start, but we are trying something new to
us – <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/mailing-list/">join us for the ride</a>, and we’ll see what happens!</p>

  </div>
</div>


<p>The COVID-19 crisis has put a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/business/economy/coronavirus-inequality.html">spotlight</a> on the dramatic growth of inequality, with the wealthy able to take refuge in holiday homes while many workers living paycheck to paycheck cannot afford to socially isolate. Somewhere in between are middle-class families that have been mostly able to ride out the storm by staying inside but at the same time are becoming increasingly aware of how precarious their security — financial and otherwise — really is.</p>



<p>Over the previous decade, no book has done more than Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” to bring the question of economic inequality back on the public agenda. At the core of Piketty’s argument is the famous formula “r &gt; g,” which he takes to be the central law of capitalism. Now emblazoned on t-shirts and coffee mugs, the formula expresses the idea that, in the absence of remedial state intervention, the return on capital (r) will grow faster than the economy (g).</p>



<p>Piketty tells the story of the runaway (and accelerating) growth of wealth at the very top, which is not in doubt. As governments eased post-World War II financial regulations over the past few decades, unrestrained capitalism created returns on assets that grew at far higher rates than GDP.</p>



<p>Where Piketty’s story is less convincing is in explaining how this trend continues in spite of growing discontent and widespread awareness of its harmful consequences. Piketty claims that the concentration of private wealth has led to the growth of a plutocracy: the concentration of political influence in the hands of the super-wealthy. But this isn’t an explanation; it just raises other questions, like why do electorates keep voting governments into office that facilitate this concentration of wealth? It is strange to see an otherwise politically middle-of-the-road scholar like Piketty embrace what is essentially a crude Marxist understanding of the capitalist state as a plaything in the hands of the wealthy.</p>



<p>The sustained acceleration of wealth at the top in a democratic society is only comprehensible if we recognize that this trend has been embedded in a wider middle-class politics that has come to center on housing and, in particular, property inflation.</p>

      “As other flagship projects of the neoliberal era floundered, the politics of middle-class aspiration came to increasingly revolve around homeownership.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>During the mid-20th century, Anglo-American countries, in particular, managed to promote widespread homeownership through a variety of policies. This <span data-note="John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) was a British economist famous for his theories of government influence on business and the economy; he argued that fiscal regulation is necessary to maintain stable economic growth.">Keynesian</span> model of capitalism brought property ownership into reach for those without access to inherited wealth. Being a wage-earner (someone who, in Marx’s famous phrase, has nothing but his labor-power to sell) was no longer a condition that condemned people to a marginal existence based on getting by from day to day. It was now a social status that could give people a concrete stake in the capitalist social order. Although this state of affairs was characterized by pernicious gender and racial hierarchies, the creation of a broad-based middle class should nonetheless be seen as a unique historic achievement.</p>



<p>The Keynesian model worked on the basis of steady annual wage growth. As the post-war era progressed, this became associated with consumer price inflation that eroded the value of assets. Neoliberalism always had its own, distinctive middle-class politics that centered on the idea of an ownership society. The supply-side doctrine of trickle-down economics was only the crudest expression of an ideology of democratized capital that was integral to the entire project of neoliberal capitalism. Inclusion in the benefits of capitalism was to come not from state protections and the power of unions but from full commitment to the spirit of entrepreneurialism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was among the first to understand the emotional appeal of that prospect when, in the midst of her attacks on unions and the public sector, she offered working-class residents the opportunity to buy the homes they had until then rented from the public sector. This, it was hoped, would serve as a buy-in to the psychology of investment and encourage ordinary people to see themselves as asset-holders rather than workers.</p>

      “In many large cities, it is virtually impossible to break into the property market just on the basis of an average wage.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>The ideology of democratized capital found expression in three key areas: pensions, human capital and housing. The risks associated with pension privatization were never lost on people, but the upward march of stock markets for much of the 1990s refocused attention on the seemingly boundless opportunities offered there. But as stock markets fizzled in the early 2000s, dreams of pension-fund capitalism largely faded along with them. Dreams of human capital too reached their zenith in the 1990s, when <span data-note="“Third way” ideas emphasize moderate social, political and economic policies to reconcile left-wing and right-wing political partisanship. Key “third way” politicians include Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.">“third way”</span> thinking in the context of the <span data-note="The idea of a “new economy” arose during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s to refer to the transition from a manufacturing-based economy to one driven by services and information technology.">“new economy”</span> held out the prospect that highly skilled knowledge workers could monetize their educational assets.</p>



<p>It is really only in the area of housing that the promise of democratized asset ownership found lasting traction. Success in this area derived in large part from the fact that it could build directly on the legacy of democratized homeownership left by the Keynesian era. Liberalizing credit markets appeared to be the most readily available way to push homeownership rates up further. The upward pressure on house prices that this entailed initially led primarily to a democratization of the <span data-note="The “wealth effect” is the change in spending that occurs when people perceive that their wealth has increased.">“wealth effect,”</span> which also became an important source of economic growth.</p>



<p>Over time, it became tempting for governments to respond to each economic slowdown by boosting the housing market, in the process creating an economy that was more and more dependent on stimulus from the wealth effect of asset inflation. As other flagship projects of the neoliberal era floundered, the politics of middle-class aspiration came to increasingly revolve around homeownership.</p>

<p>The home became an asset rather than simply property — an investment that was expected not merely to generate returns but also capital gains. As people with stagnant wages and unstable employment bought houses with large amounts of debt, it became more and more important for those houses to appreciate in value. At least initially, this wealth effect helped to compensate for stagnant wages. The Keynesian household became a <span data-note="Hyman Minsky was an American economist who lived from 1919 to 1996. He is often referred to as a “post-Keynesian” economist, and his work stresses the role of uncertainty, speculation and debt in the economic system.">Minskyan</span> household, increasingly dependent on the speculative returns on its investment. Capitalism itself transitioned to a Minskyan phase, where the continued appreciation of an asset was a precondition for being able to finance it.</p>



<p>But of course, the very logic of credit-driven home purchases pushed prices up to heights where it was increasingly difficult to enter the market. Property inflation benefits the already propertied and excludes aspiring middle-class households from the housing market. In the U.S. as well as in other countries, including the U.K. and Canada, homeownership rates show a particular pattern over the period from 1980 to 2020 — an upward trend followed by a downward trend. Property inflation over time eroded the possibility of buying a home on the basis of a wage alone. In many large cities, it is virtually impossible to break into the property market just on the basis of an average wage.</p>



<p>The crisis of 2007-8 did significant damage to the reputation of housing as a democratic generator of wealth, but things have become significantly worse since then. Defying widespread expectations, housing markets in large urban centers rebounded with a vengeance. This has raised the bar for entry dramatically: The same salary that would have allowed someone to buy into the property market 10 years ago no longer allows that, because in some places, property prices have doubled in the meantime.</p>

    <p>
      “Housing inflation has built a new class structure that revolves around asset ownership instead of employment.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>The post-crisis era has also exposed a generational rift. The consequences of property inflation are felt particularly acutely by millennials. Many members of that generation played by all the rules yet, by their mid-20s, still find themselves without any real prospect of a middle-class existence — unless, of course, they have wealthy parents willing to help. Because property gets passed from one generation to the next, it makes little sense to frame the problem in terms of boomers against millennials. The millennial phenomenon is so important because it is in that age cohort that the fault lines produced by four decades of sustained property inflation are becoming highly visible.</p>



<p>This has hardly gone unnoticed, but widespread concerns have yet to translate into significant policy changes. Policymakers and politicians are increasingly concerned about issues of housing affordability, but any policies designed to address the problem are inevitably double-edged: Measures, like lower interest rates, that bring property ownership into reach for some simultaneously push prices up further. In other words, we face a situation of policy lock-in, whereby policymakers can only improve things in the short term by making them worse in the long term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I see a common pattern with startups and teams I’ve advised or been a part of. I call it the Software Over-specification Death Spiral, or SODS for short.</p>



<p>It looks like this:</p>



<ol><li>Product Manager (or CEO, Engineering Manager, etc) drafts up some sort of specifications or requirements for a new feature or product.</li><li>Product Manager (or CEO, Engineering Manager, etc) drafts up some sort of specifications or requirements for a new feature or product.</li><li>The requirements are handed over to the engineering team to implement.</li><li>The engineering team “implements” it, but gets some things wrong. One bucket of things that are prone to being wrong could be things that were so obvious that the PM thought they weren’t worth making explicit. Another bucket are corner or edge-cases that the PM didn’t think of.</li><li>The PM is surprised at this, and work has to be redone.</li><li>In an effort to prevent this in the future, both the PM and the engineering team agree that requirements need to be more detailed.</li><li>Surprise: despite the increased details in requirements, the engineering team still gets it wrong.</li></ol>



<p>In each iteration of this loop, everyone agrees the requirements just need more details, but every time that happens, things are still wrong. What’s going on?</p>



<h4>Breeding Code&nbsp;Monkeys</h4>



<p>You’re breeding code monkeys, is what’s happening. Software is complex and malleable, and no set of specifications or requirements will ever be complete. There will always be behavior that requires some “filling in the blanks” at implementation time. The person doing the implementation needs to be able to either:</p>



<ul><li>Recognize when they should ask for clarification, or, preferably,</li><li>Be able to fill-in-the-blanks correctly.</li></ul>



<p>Counterintuitively, once you have this problem, the more you try to weed out ambiguity in requirements, the more likely you are cause <em>the opposite</em> effect of what you’ve want. Engineers turn off the part of their brain that they would use to think through product decisions, and become, essentially, “code monkeys” that just do what they’re told.</p>



<h4>A Better&nbsp;Way</h4>



<p>Does that mean you shouldn’t write specifications or requirements, or you should right <em>less? </em>Well, let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet. Specifications are important, but if you’re missing key pieces, they can make your problem worse.</p>



<p>At a high-level, when you’re building software, there are three questions to answer:</p>



<ol><li>What the software does—requirements and behavior</li><li>Why it does what it does—actual problem it solves for its users</li><li>How it does what it does—the actual implementation</li></ol>



<p>These three are all related. SODS occurs when engineers try to do #1 and #3 without understanding #2. As Simon Sinek would say, “you must start with why”.</p>



<p>It’s on both the PM and the engineering team to understand “the why”. A few suggestions for PMs (and engineers):</p>



<ul><li>Hire or worth with engineers who are inclined to understand the product, because they could be users themselves or because they have some other interest in the product space (or, as an engineer, try to help build <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">products that you would use</a> or that you find interesting).</li><li>Make sure you explain <em>why</em> something is worth building (or, as an engineer, make sure you understand that, and if you don’t, ask).</li><li>Push engineers to be involved in <a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-software-engineers-be-involved-in-product-decisions" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">product decisions</a> (or, as an engineer, try to be involved in various pre-implementation parts of the product lifecycle).</li><li>Undertake other activities that help engineers build product intuition. Engineers can spend time with users, spend time understanding your products analytics, etc.</li><li>If you really want to test whether an engineer is thinking about “the why”, have an engineer write the specifications for a feature of reasonable size, and then have the PM review them. If they can’t even attempt that, that’s usually a bad sign (though the worst sign of all is if they absolutely don’t want to even try).</li></ul>



<p>Don’t fall victim to SODS.</p>

<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><h2>Couples with fertility issues will also see a change in citizenship benefits</h2>



<p>Canadian families are as diverse as Canadians themselves, and everyone deserves the same rights and opportunities, no matter who they love or how they identify.</p>



<p>In recognition of the diversity of <a href="http://citizenship/" target="_blank" aria-label="Canadian  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Canadian </a>families, the Honourable Marco E.&nbsp;L. Mendicino, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, today announced a change in the interpretation of “parent” under the Citizenship Act. The change allows non-biological Canadian parents who are their child’s legal parent at birth to pass down Canadian citizenship to their children born abroad in the first generation.</p>



<p>“I am very happy to announce this historic and positive declaration made by Quebec’s Superior Court. This change by Immigration Refugees and Citizenship <a href="http://citizenship/" target="_blank" aria-label="Canada  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Canada </a>means that non-biological legal parents at birth and biological parents are now viewed equally as a child’s parent for the purposes of citizenship by descent. Canadian LGBTQ2+ families and parents experiencing fertility issues have waited too long for this important day. I know this was a difficult and stressful time for the Caron / van der Ven family, and Canada is grateful to them for the courage and strength they have shown in righting this wrong.”</p>



<p><strong>– The Honourable Marco E.&nbsp;L. Mendicino, P.C., M.P., Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://www.thedailyscrum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canadian-citizenship-benefits.jpg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.thedailyscrum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canadian-citizenship-benefits.jpg"></figure>



<p>This new interpretation helps Canadian parents who have relied on assisted human reproduction to start a family, including members of the LGBTQ2+ community and couples with fertility issues. Until now, a child born abroad was automatically recognized as a citizen at birth only if the child shared a genetic link to the Canadian parent or if the child was born to a Canadian parent in the first generation.</p>



<p>“Getting citizenship for our son was a long, sometimes hurtful and frustrating journey. We are extremely happy and relieved that the court corrected this discriminating policy, not only for our family, but also for many same-sex and non-traditional families around the world who could not get Canadian citizenship for their children. We are very thankful to IRCC for implementing the new changes so quickly, and above all, to our lawyers Olga Redko and Audrey Boctor, without whom we would never have gotten this far. – <strong><em>Laurence Caron and Elsje van der Ven</em></strong></p>



<p>This change is the result of the advocacy of the Caron / van der Ven family, who sought a durable solution through the court system to address situations where some children of parents using assisted human reproduction did not acquire citizenship automatically at birth. The Superior Court of Québec affirmed that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) new interpretation of “parent” recognizes equally biological parents and legal parents at birth, and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects this interpretation under the law.</p>

	<div>
		<div>
			<p>I was such an idiot. I gave up literally $125,000 to do dropshipping.</p>
<p>You see, I quit my $250,000 a year job to go do dropshipping.</p>
<p>I spent 6 months dropshipping, fulltime. That was all I did. The opportunity cost of that was massive.</p>
<p>I also lost $2000 USD after spending $12,000 on Facebook ads and Instagram shoutouts.</p>
<p>And if I had to go back in time to March 2019, I’d yell “Stop!!! Don’t do dropshipping! Do this other thing instead!”</p>
<p>And in fact, as early as May I had read a anti-dropshipping thread that explained why dropshipping was a bad first venture. I should’ve listened. I should’ve paid more attention.</p>
<p>But alas, here we are.</p>
<p>Wait, what is “that other thing” I’d have told myself to do?</p>
<p>Well, I guess you’ll just have to read until the end to find out 🙂</p>
<p>Now don’t let this blog post discourage you, because online business is a worthy goal. But there are other online businesses you should consider that may be cheaper.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can learn something from my $2000 mistake. If this post helps save you some money, then I will consider myself a happy man.</p>



<p>You might be thinking: well, I bet he didn’t spend enough time on it. Or I bet he just didn’t want to spend money (or was too afraid to). Or maybe he didn’t read enough about copywriting / marketing.</p>
<p>Well let me talk a little more about my dropshipping experience so you can know if this post is for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I had a ton of time</strong>. The 6 months I spent dropshipping was basically full-time. I had no job (didn’t need one). I freelanced myself about $2000 for a rate of about $60/hour, plus some credit card signup bonuses ($300 here and there), to fund the dropshipping venture
<ul>
<li>So no, there’s no “laziness” or “not enough effort” excuse. That was a solid 6 months. This venture should’ve “worked” by then. It didn’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I was well read</strong>. I’d read Charlie Munger’s Psychological Checklist. Influence. All the recommended copywriting books, direct response books (e.g. Scientific Advertising, Ogilvy’s stuff). Really. I’d read a lot man. I didn’t slack on this dropshipping venture.</li>
<li><strong>I had a bunch of money</strong>.&nbsp;I had enough savings from my previous job to last me a lifetime (<em>easily</em>). But I’ve never started a business. I really wanted to start a business. And it wasn’t going to be in-person. If I’m gonna start a business, it better be online.
<ul>
<li>What was my previous job? I was a software engineer in Silicon Valley. Living extremely frugally. I had enough money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, I was dropshipping from Aliexpress. I used Shopify. I watched all the Youtube videos of James Holt, Gabriel St Germain (appears to be the most legit dropshipper there).</p>
<p>OK? So I had everything going for me (theoretically at least). Why did I end up ditching dropshipping?</p>

<p>There’s one main reason: it’s really expensive.</p>
<p>You can learn the same thing for a lot cheaper. And I mean&nbsp;<em>a lot</em> cheaper. And possibly even better too.</p>
<p>Well there are other reasons too:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) It’s really expensive</li>
<li>A2) Split testing is EXPENSIVE in dropshipping</li>
<li>B) The learning curve for dropshipping is extremely steep, due to many skillsets needed to make it work</li>
<li>C) A lot of headaches come with scaling a winner in dropshipping</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="A)_It%E2%80%99s_really_expensive"></span>A) It’s really expensive.<span></span></h2>
<p>How much budget do you need to start a dropshipping business?</p>
<p>Well, the fake gurus out there will tell you only need $300 to start a dropshipping business. “<em>And you too can make $10,000 a month!</em>” Ah, SMH.</p>
<p>It’s true. To&nbsp;<em>start</em>, you only need maybe $100. Shopify subscription, domain name, a couple Shopify plugins, maybe an Instagram shoutout.</p>
<p>But to do it&nbsp;<em>properly</em>, a real marketing venture, you need wayyyy more than $300. And I mean WAY more. I’m talking $10,000 – $15,000 range.</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you mean Muhima? How can it cost that much?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah well I’m talking about&nbsp;<em>testing</em> ads, testing products.</p>
<p>To run all those tests, you need a lot of money. To buy data.</p>
<p>And how many tests will it take to find a winner?</p>
<p>The best dropshippers I’ve watched on Youtube and the best marketers I followed on Twitter all have a hit rate of about 1 in 10. Or 10%.</p>
<p>To test a product, you need to run 3 tests, running different emotional angles. 1 headline/image for each one.</p>
<p>What does each test cost? The rule of thumb is to run the ad to 3x gross margin in loss. For example, if you make $30 gross margin on your product ($40 price point, dropshipped from China for $10 each), then you need to run the test to $90.</p>
<p>So each product you’re testing out costs $270, at minimum.</p>
<p>But wait, lets say you had one promising angle returning -20% ROI (which is good). Then you gotta run 2 more variations off that. Lets say you change up the image/video creative. Boom, that’s another $270.</p>
<p>Ok, now zoom out. Remember the best marketers have a hit rate of 10%. Oh shit. 10 times $270 is how many? $2700 already. Oh shit.</p>
<p>But wait, you’re a newbie. You’re not experienced like those guys. And besides, what if you have a run of bad luck? So your likely hit rate is no better than 5%. To give yourself a margin of safety, ideally you want to have a budget twice that, just in case. How much are we at now? 20*$270 * 2 = $10,000+</p>
<p>Yeah man. It’s expensive to do dropshipping right.</p>
<p>Believe me, there are other internet businesses that don’t require as much starting budget to do right.</p>
<h2><span id="A2)_Split_testing_is_EXPENSIVE_in_dropshipping"></span>A2) Split testing is EXPENSIVE in dropshipping<span></span></h2>
<p>And I mean EXPENSIVE.</p>
<p>True split testing requires statistically significant data (lets say at least 90% statistical significance. Really it should be 95%, but some people relax the standard to 90% in the interest of trying to hit green sooner)</p>
<p>Do you know how many conversions you need to reach statistical significance?</p>
<p>3 conversions ain’t gonna cut it bro. 10 isn’t going to do it either.</p>
<p>I’m talking at least 50-100, if you’re trying to split-test a 20% improvement. I’ve had split-tests run up to 200 conversions.</p>
<p>So lets call it between 100-200 conversions.</p>
<p>It really takes A LOT of data to hit statistical significance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Muhima, What does this mean for dropshipping? How much does it cost to split test in dropshipping?</p></blockquote>
<p>Lets say you’re testing a clothing product for $40. What’s 50 conversions? Oh SHIT. $2000?</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT. You need $2000+ just run ONE split test?</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Are you starting to see why you need a BIG budget to really learn marketing with dropshipping?</p>
<p>You’re only learning marketing if you’re doing split tests — everything else is just throwing shit at the wall. You don’t&nbsp;<em>really</em> know what works. It’s just guesswork.</p>
<h2><span id="B)_The_learning_curve_for_dropshipping_is_extremely_steep,_due_to_many_skills_required_(i_e_many_moving_parts)"></span>B) The learning curve for dropshipping is extremely steep, due to many skills required (i.e. many moving parts)<span></span></h2>
<p>Compared to this other business model I ended up switching to, there are MANY moving parts in dropshipping.</p>
<p>If you’re new to internet marketing, it’s going to be difficult to troubleshoot. As a professional software engineer, oh man. Add just one moving part, and the complexity of your project may have doubled or tripled.</p>
<p>Yes there are people who’ve succeeded with dropshipping, but it’s not easy for a beginner to pickup.</p>
<p>Here’s a running list of skills you need to succeed in dropshipping:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing ads</strong>. You have to know what makes a good image/video. You have to learn how to write click baity titles (since you’re bidding CPM, not CPC). If you want to do a good job, you should learn how to spy on competitor’s ads and how to analyze them.</li>
<li><strong>Writing pre-sales landing page</strong>. Chances are pretty good you’re not writing pre-sales page if you’re a newbie. And no, “product description” does NOT count, SMH guys. I’m talking something like a survey lander, or just a good old sales letter with a headline and some inspirational story “This 95 year old woman feels like a 20 year old doing yoga on this yoga mat!”</li>
<li><strong>Writing the sales funnel</strong>. Are you going to be doing free+shipping or straight up product sale with $20+ margin? How are you going to do upsells? Downsells? Cross sells?</li>
<li><strong>Monetizing backend with emails</strong>. With Facebook CPMs on the rise, I saw a lot of marketers adapt by taking a slight loss on the frontend offer and try to make it up in the backend. LTV man. Well if you’re a newbie – oh man. It’s tough.</li>
<li><strong>Building out a professional, branded-looking website</strong>. Hopefully this is the easier part for you. But there are still many who find the task of building out a Shopify website daunting.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling a winner when you have one</strong>. This is the easier part. But still easy to fuck up if you’re not careful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you a newbie? Take a quick pause and look at what you have to figure out.</p>
<p>There’s like at least 5 variables you have to troubleshoot or test.</p>
<p>Really tough learning curve. Very steep.</p>
<h2><span id="C)_A_lot_of_headaches_come_with_doing_big_sale_numbers_on_dropshipping"></span>C) A lot of headaches come with doing big sale numbers on dropshipping<span></span></h2>
<p>Lets say you’ve got a winner and you’re trying to scale it as hard as you can.</p>
<p>Congrats! That’s an accomplishment! (And also sure to be short-lived — grab as much as you can before competition comes in).</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more challenges!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paypal withholding</strong>. Paypal has a reputation for suddenly closing your account. Just like Stripe, they’re wary of dropshippers.There was a funny joke I read on Reddit about this. Some guy said he had $20,000 in his Paypal and another guy says: “How are your balls so big, I can’t even imagine” LOL.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe will close your account</strong> if they find out you are dropshipping, even if your refund rate is less than 1%. Dropshipping is against their Terms of Service. How will you get another Stripe account? And all the money in the Stripe account goes poof. It’s not yours anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Refunds will come. High refund fees.</strong> You have to pay a $20 chargeback fee&nbsp;<em>in addition</em> to a full refund.</li>
<li><strong>Bad cash flow</strong>. Paypal/Stripe may keep a healthy reserve of your funds, for about 60-90 days. Your FB ads (which is your primary cost) is billed monthly. So this is bad for your cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Need to hire customer support agency</strong>. Eats into your profit margin. Or else you spend hours each day answering customer support emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long story short, it’s tough to make dropshipping a truly passive business. You definitely need to dedicate at least a few hours a day to tending the garden so to speak.</p>
